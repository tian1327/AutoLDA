 hello from New York City New York City definitely doesn't look birth feel the same but it doesn't necessarily seem like a bad thing as a lot of us are just adjusting to this new normal so I wanted to ask you again how are you how is your work or study going in the climate where the unemployment rate in the United States is surging with over 30 million cases as an employer I'm doing my best to keep that team motivated and protect them our entire create beauty team is healthy and happy we definitely have the privilege of staying at home and working from home in our sweat pads and work-wise it's been pretty useful nothing has really changed we still have a lot of busyness going on a lot of big exciting projects that you can expect from us    there you have any new skills you're working on during this time I was definitely a little bit over ambitious to enroll myself into an online accounting course and I have to confess that I have not finished it and there are tons of unfinished Skillshare courses I thought I would use this time to read more but instead I've been just having more screen time more Netflix and chill time and more tick tocking for sure and I totally thought I would spend more time in the kitchen cooking more healthy meals but instead I found myself snacking more and right at the moment when I was almost sabotaging myself for the food choices that I've been making daily harvest sent a box full of farm-to-table thoughtfully source chef's crafted foods to my door and I was blown away by the quality of fresh and delicious ingredients you can see and read out loud it's offers of range of smoothies harvest bowls and so much more if you're still pretty busy with work or study I think this is a really good option for you topped in I love how these harvest Bowls could be a really fast and easy yet nutritious lunch or dinner options you can make in less than five minutes it is so amazing and healthy and I loved the variety of smoothie options that they provide and you have to try this mango papaya one it's so so good you just need to pour it liquid of your choice blend it and just drink it and it's really really delicious if you like to take care of yourself with daily harvest you can use my promo code Lia 25 to get $25 off your first box at daily harvest calm during the weekends I was spending more time hanging out with my plants I've never owned these many plants before so I've been pretty enjoying and watching them thrive with love and care I'm also trying to grow my own lettuce too but its teaching me a lot about patience weekend's are still mixed with work to filming videos editing videos brains were made videos and shooting a week worth of tactile content but I still don't forget to have fun I think it's been really really good to relax and just chill my mind    you through the cracks in the pavement and my favorite    so a week ago I posted on my Instagram stories that I'm opening up my calendar to be able to take 30 minutes one-on-one conversation with one of my pom-pom found out there especially being an entrepreneur I know how lonely this journey could be and especially in this unprecedented uncertain time the stress that a lot of entrepreneurs might be dealing with would be enormous so I wanted to be the sounding board to them in help and support in any way that I can it's been really good so far my voice is dying mm-hmm so can you explain to me what stage you're exactly at I know that you have a concoction made is that something that's ready to scale like ready to manufacture at this point mm-hmm I also accidentally made this dirty matcha latte go viral just combining a regular matcha latte with the talc Kona coffee whip oh my god it's been a true guilty pleasure and really an amazing it's just a refreshing drink I love it definitely allowing me to use this precious time to focus on what I have been deep prioritizing for a long time which is looking after myself and looking after what is important after all as always thank you so much for spending time with me and I'll talk to you guys later take care bye
