 take goodbye to plastic bags they're going the way of the subway token disappearing from New York life the legislation also seeks to cut the use of brown paper bags to localities will have the option of imposing a five cent fee to get a paper sack ideas to go not from plastic to paper but from plastic to reusable a bit I'm trying like a different angle over here so I think this is actually working there's there's actually a reason why I film in this corner it's because the only light that I have comes from this window and it's natural and it's free so yeah this is why I'm in this corner over here I'm so pale hey guys it's Megan again I don't know if you guys noticed but I actually changed my youtube name to make Penn Lynn instead of Megan Penn Lynn's just a little creative choice I've actually always gone by Megan my whole life and since I've moved to New York here I actually changed it to make a few of my close friends here so call me Megan but my whole work life work balance calls me Meg and I'm trying to transition so here we are so no surprise I am doing another quarantine video just because that's pretty much what I'm focused on right now but I also kind of wanted to document history document everything that's happening on the ground as a regular citizen as a regular person just to have this kind of record of what everything was like on the ground with me recording it and just you know how things have slowly slowly changed in the city but what I was doing today earlier obviously is going to the grocery store going to the grocery store in New York City has become an event it is not just as simple as me getting off of the subway popping in to our local grocery store grabbing a few items heading out it used to take 10 minutes for me to go to the grocery store is not that big of a deal just lately that looks like awkward  now it is an hour long process even though I go to a grocery store there's just a few blocks away from my house and obviously you saw the reason it was an hour long process to prepare to go to the store and then you know the walking there is easy but then you have to wait in line outside of the store and then do your shopping you know be careful what you're touching and doing and then you have to wait in line to get checked out once you get checked out you head back to you know our apartments and that's when I just infect everything so it has become a huge huge process to go to the grocery store and it's difficult because when you go to the stores here as I've talked about in my target run video a little promo back to that but as I talked about and not when I first moved here something I had to address too was that when you go to the grocery store you have to be very exact in what you buy because you can only buy so much like so much that you can carry now that we have what I told you as well as the plastic bag ban we can only carry what's in like what I had in my little tote bag or you can pay to do the paper bags which is also not a bad idea but obviously we're trying to completely stay away from that if we're all staying healthy and we're all you know staying safe and doing the best we can I think that's more important than anything we are flattening the curve which is amazing to see I'm so excited to see this hospitalization start declining and start going down because this is just not an illness that anyone wants to have a few of my friends have contracted it a few of my friends here have contracted it and then actually my friend back in Kansas City contracted it and it does not sound like something fun or anything that I want to experience the weird thing about it that I've discovered is that everyone it affects everyone so so differently my friend that got it in Kansas City she's actually a nurse so shout out to her thank you for all of your help you have no idea when she got it she she doesn't get sick she's not a sick person she doesn't normally ever get sick and this dragged her down she had a high fever had all of that stuff so yeah it's kind of weird seeing her be sick for eight days straight obviously none of these cases were confirmed I am in the younger half of the group and we're not getting tested obviously because we're not severe enough to get tested but I'm pretty positive based on all their symptoms the fever where we are obviously that they had coronavirus yeah I'm actually filming this on Easter so happy easter everyone it was my birthday a couple of days ago so this has been really weird it doesn't feel like anything is happening it just feels like another day doesn't even feel like April honestly I feel like it's March 10th right now just because of everything and I'm you know not even really getting outside I don't think any city in the States will get as bad as we are just because of our just because of how we are as a city we're all on top of each other we all take public transportation we don't have cars to kind of go around in it's very different it's very different than like Los Angeles or Seattle or any of those places it's just everyone is very reliant on a very public system and that's why we got very bad and there's a ton of people here it is the really only big public transit in the country I know like Chicago and Los Angeles and DC all of these big places have subways or the train or whatever it is just not quite as quite as extensive or quite as reliant like as the people are reliant on it as we are in New York City I don't even have a car here I used to have a car in Kansas City I drove for 10 years and I don't have one I mean I don't have one here you don't need it here you just need the subways that's really all you need once in a while and uber of course to me it's very interesting that everyone in New York is wearing a mask it's probably 90% of our people here are wearing a mask so yeah it's a different world that we're living in right now it's an adjustment to get used to I know I was kind of gloomy in my last video I wanted to kind of show the realities of this situation I think we all have our good and bad days I was a really bad day for me actually last week was not a great week for me I'm trying to lift my spirits and come out of it and keep seeing the positives you know I think going out of the house more as helping that's why I made that mask that I showed you actually made that myself which I'm actually doing a video on how to make it as well that will be coming out the next few uploads so yeah so that's just a little glimpse of the life that is happening in New York right now I think we're all a little more hopeful at this point just because everything's been flattening and again hopefully we can start decreasing so doing much better than my last video I feel a lot more positive and I know that it's it's just important to stay positive in these times as we know thank you for all of your kind words from all of you from I know my Instagram is
