 just like take some drops of the CD and see if I calm down  hello so it is officially quarantine day number one for me I had to work yesterday but I just got the news that Laura shut me down delightful third and finally made this decision so I am now staying at home for the next like two my half weeks it's gonna be interesting I'm going to try to be productive but it's already out to Connor a bad start because I woke up at 12:30   so we finished our practice and everything then we want Justin episode of narcos so right now I'm just like chilling and I'm going to order some stuff from Amazon for like decorating for my room tour during like things Amazon because your girl got her deposit back from study abroad being cancelled so I ordered some light clips some big plant things some wood wallpaper I'm thinking I'm gonna put it on this wall and then I have some aegyo a strand of lights with the Polaroid clips a minute I think I'm gonna put those on and then I got some silk pillowcases because I want to make my bed look cuter and then I got some curtain lights those on this fall with the plants kind of coming in between so all I did today was shop online on Amazon order a bunch of stuff when I'm watching I chose the best over Chinese food and then I took a shower and now I'm doing a face mask on all of my peoples   okay so we're gonna start fixing my drawers as you can see these are like completely off the track so I'm hoping that it's like something we can fix because I need to organize my makeup and I have literally no space left in these drawers and then I have an entire bag of gratis I have not put away yet so we got a mix piece  but we were trying to fix the drawers and making sure that they don't collapse but um these drawers absolutely terrible the money Amazon the worst quality George we've ever bought well I bought these ones but it's the same brand for the dresser which as you can see it's not doing so great either so yeah don't buy this brand of furniture because you will not even get six months of use out of it it literally is a waste of money all my four so now I can organize everything and I do I got some music cued up so we are just going to start organizing all this makeup and play some jams this is everything that I was already in my drawers so I'm sorting it like my piles so this is all stuff that's open but it's for my freelance kit this is unopened skincare this is open skincare unopened makeup so now I'm gonna go ahead and store everything with my from my gratis bag to and just make all the piles so I can see how I'm gonna fit it all in here  so I'm done cleaning I organized everything I have a bunch of trash to take out now but this is how the room looks I did my best but yeah my next journey is going to be doing I need to do laundry all you need to do laundry we both have a lot of stuff in there you to go through that and like get rid of everything in there that I don't need and I have some stuff like tucked underneath this drawer thing not drawer on cart and I have stuff like behind it so I need to go through all that stuff and then my next mission after that is gonna be the closet and decluttering that and then trying to figure out what I'm gonna do with this broken dresser because it's very ugly and I'm just sick of looking at it but I put up a calendar so we can keep track of the days so yeah I'm pretty proud of myself for how clean I got the room I'm so excited to get rid of these broken lights and don't work on one half and get my whole wall of lights those should be here by I think Friday or Saturday but now I'm just gonna go ahead and do a little more power because I need to not game all the way back that I've lost  okay so I just got out of the shower but I'm gonna do some my skincare before I start to clean and everything so this is the Sephora glow peel pads you wanted to show you this because these are like one of my favorite products from Sephora they're very similar to the first aid Beauty facial radiance pads but they're a lot cheaper and we were gonna exfoliate this face because I have not done exfoliation in a while like a couple days I just want to talk about my hormonal acne just a little bit because if you guys watch my skincare routine you can see like then like my skin flawless beautiful I take it for granted and so I'm sure know if you've seen that video you're probably like what is going on baby I've been struggling with hormonal breakouts I know they're warm because they're literally only in this area and have never had a happy in my entire life like when I was a teenager my skin was completely clear a little like Italy a couple pimples like around the time of the month and that was it so I knew that this was not like normal I'm hoping that my hormones and my body just figures itself out okay so since I was talking about my hormonal acne I do want to mention some products that have helped and kind of help keep it under control and I'm using to help like feed on the acne part so I mentioned the peel pads before from support when I don't use those in the morning I use this the Dickinson's witch hazel I know this is not the best for your skin because it's like full of alcohol and like it's very drying on the skin but just use it in the area where I'm getting the acne then helping like keep that area clean because I need to keep that area as clean as possible I do suggest like maybe trying a wood table that's more gentle I know they have like a sensitive skin one but I gotta set this from an influencer box so that's why I've been using that this is amazing and I'm sure you guys have seen that's all over tick-tock and everything so the ordinary a J&B hapen solution it's a chemical exfoliator so it's been getting rid of all the dead skin and creating the cell turnover and really helping with fading and the acne marks that I have I only use this about once a week because it is very strong these two products I alternate the nights they use these this is the ordinary glycolic acid 20 a solution so I use this every other night it's really good for just like chemical exfoliating and just help me bathe the acne scars and then the luminol oil is really nice it's a button all actually almost out of here if you can see I'm so sad this is good if you want to use a retinol or retinol aid and you have more dry skin or sensitive skin because it's not harsh at all it doesn't dry out my skin at all and it's really nice you see an instant of friends like when you wake up after putting this on your skin's just looks like less red and just better it just looks like brighter and less red so I really really like this and then I also have been using these two products this is the BIOS on schooling and teach rebalancing oil this is amazing for helping to calm the skin and also clear and a key and then I've been using like heels cannabis seed oil which I just put on this is really nice for calming down the skin it does have a strong fragrance so if you guys don't like the smell of oregano you might not like this because there's a regular oil and it today I've got this um shirt that I got from a thrift store think about a consolidation army back home Kansas I got these topic lines like things and uh somebody's off so Ricky made starting in cake yeah I'm kind of nervous do we put anything on top I mean the fun part oh I'm so happy one of my packages from Amazon came so I have the Leafs that I'm going to sing on my paw and then what is this oh I got the pillowcases the contact paper I'm gonna put all over the walls and then this is like the jewelry organizer I ordered okay so here is the or canines I'm gonna put this I'm gonna buy it over there okay so this is the jewelry holder I put it all together I brought my jewelry on here a lot more jewelry than I thought so the yeah I think it looks cute right there  I love this shirt so much just because like the fact that I got to go to the concert it was such a miracle and so I am just wearing black leggings and fuzzy socks today I just these gray and black I'm pretty sad because it's so dark and gloomy outside like I don't even know I put my blinds up because there's no light to even come in it's just all cloudy and dark but look at my amazing view looking at like an alley and like other people windows just fantastic oh I am going to do a workout really quickly just like a quick 15-minute workout probably focusing on like abs and butt because I put my biggest it scary hello guys so I did a makeup look really good tutorial I'm not like I'm not I feel though yeah I really wanted to focus on my doing like inner corner shadow because I thought it would be a nice change and like doing like a very like angular look I wanted to do something like a little bit more colourful with them once I started like sitting down I liked putting everything on it was like I'm still not feeling that creative gonna make a chicken sandwich because I'm starving and I just love eat and watch Netflix so this is my sandwich and I'm gonna have some animal crackers on the side because I'm literally a child but my sandwich looks so good I'm just so excited to eat this do you guys remember this movie oh my god this is taking me so far back in my childhood I was literally seven years old when this came out we're watching this I'm so happy my last package came from Amazon so now I can do all of my decorating that I wanted to do so first these are the light clips I ordered from Amazon really this is the package the lights comes in like it no instructions it's just here you go also it's next close to the mm oh I'm so confused so this is why this lady thought she got the remote with it and everything and she got instructions this is literally that all that was in the pocket you guys I'm so mad I got these lights already to like hang up and they don't work like I've been trying to turn them on I've been plugging them into different outlets and they literally don't work all of the reviews on Amazon were good and I'm I'm pissed all things I just want to decorate my room I'm this close to having a mental breakdown last time I I blogged like was a couple hours ago and I was a mental breakdown about my lights not working I had more of a breakdown after that and almost cried so I think that shows how I'm handling this warranty right now because I guess like the stress that went through my mind was like I don't know how I'm gonna return this because I can't print from my home because I don't have a printer so I'm gonna have to go somewhere to get it printed and I was just like super stressed out and I was just wishing I could just go to the store and buy some lights and just have like a normal shopping experience cuz I honestly hate shopping online so much especially with Amazon I always have to mean that goes on with them so we're good now I have some chips away cuz he's gonna eat all I want to not go so I just got up I took a shower didn't care routine did my hair care and now I'm about to go ahead and FaceTime my group for my cosmetic product college class because we have a report that we have to do from our last lab that we had and so we're gonna work on that together and then talk about our project okay so I decided to flip my buddy because it's reversible and do the white side and I like it a lot I'm really excited for when I finally get the greenery up there because I feel like it'll look really good like all together okay so this is my breakfast I just made like an egg sandwich with spinach there's a slice of I think pepper jack cheese on there some hot sauce um turkey bacon and then I have another slice of turkey bacon and then some cream cheese oh I'm an English muffin and then I'm also gonna eat a banana because it's like 116 and I have not eaten yet for the day so I'm gonna eat all of this and this is gonna be like my main like breakfast slash lunch okay so I just finished filming a tutorial for this look I'm actually really happy with what it turned out to be I literally had no plan going into it I just grabbed a pile and started doing it I like it I think it's cute it's like giving me a cotton candy vibes okay so Ricky's home we put on the green leaves these we put up the green leaves on the wall so I'm super happy with how it looks it would look so cute if we had the lights with it too but those are coming okay so that's what that make sure you looking like it smells spicy which is good I love it spicy so I'm just gonna have the turkey and the onion to the mixture out and then it's gonna simmer for 30 minutes I forgot to add the corn I'm not so I'm gonna add that now I completely forgot so here is the finished product in the
