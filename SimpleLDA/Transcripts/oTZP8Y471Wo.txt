 honestly it's just so good to kind of get out during the times like these and just get some fresh air so it's not exactly uh panning out as we originally had hoped  hi guys welcome back to our Channel so today we are at a New York State Park Team New York state parks are open and we are specifically at late minnewaska state park so joining us today and just explore outside honestly it's just so good to kind of get out during the times like these and just get some fresh air as long as you're doing it safe and being respectful of other people do it okay joining us see you soon on the next stop     hey guys hey we are at our first stop boasting Falls I think that's the way you call it kind of the main attraction here at the State Bar and honestly it's just so nice to get in that fresh air and really go hiking during times like these happy that were out about in a very safe way we just made it to these Falls till the trail starts up there and then we just kind of headed down this way and then just kind of went down and we're at the bottom of the falls I just think that the slab the rocks are just so pretty and just gives such an accent that's so different or like any waterfall that I've ever seen      so we just tried to leave the parking lot that we have parked at and they're not allowing us to leave without exiting the state park there are 50% max capacity right now in order to ensure that people are social distancing so we're just trying to figure out how to go to the lake lake loop trail and try to get as close as possible with the car instead of having to walk to the beginning of the trail and then also walk the trail but that doesn't seem like it's working out for us right now and we left my parents somewhere and to go back to the car now we've got a quote back to them so it's not exactly a panning out as we originally had hoped but we'll see we'll get to the trail someway somehow because we really want to enjoy this day out and you know after being cooped up for so long  okay so we are at the lake minnewaska be careful where you're stopping could you really don't want to  so we went up to Sam's voice to the ice cave the parking lots full so we were pretty hungry so we stopped on the side of the road to have our lunch so let me show you what we have for lunch today we got chicken tortilla soup that we put in a thermal and tuna sandwiches and then we got our toppings and literally right on the side of the road  locale free just a sneak chillin chillin on a rock each chillin like a villain  okay so on our way here there's like I'll show you like stacks of like rocks I think that people were just doing   so we tried to do the ice cave trail which is that Sam's point so Santa is open so only like the woodsy like carriage roads are open so unfortunately these smaller trails aren't open just because they feel that people can practice saying it's a little disappointing that these shows are like not open because I was definitely looking forward to them because they look really cool going through the caves and stuff but obviously we are in a crisis right now and we're trying to flatten the curve so I also understand so come on let's go but it's disappointing but it is what it is at least we still were able to to get out and have some fun well they're being safe it makes sense yeah make sense so yeah it's closed and right there to enable social distancing right so time to head back but look how cool that would have been to go down there if this goes down some like cool rig a path that would have been awesome to go down but definitely maybe another time so I know it is going to probably be a short video but just wanting to show you what to do and what we're doing during self-id isolation just some ideas so you're not at home as long as you're following the rules and the CDC if you're in America guidelines and really staying safe and healthy definitely go out and get some fresh air is just it's totally worth it anyway guys thank you so much for watching and like comment and subscribe bye guys I never knew that something existed like this in New York honestly beautiful
