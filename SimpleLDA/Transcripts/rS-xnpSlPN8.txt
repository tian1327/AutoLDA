Brewers actually got this a while ago it's actually my Sydney and I remember I literally bought my mom one not that long and you know he had sanitizer sold out everywhere now so so I just got finished

been feeling amazing I don't know if I want to get into it yet I don't know how to talk about it but I guess eventually somewhere in this video I will so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and listen to some music and you guys everything  this is crazy so it's currently March 25th 8:55 p.m. really for no reason I think I went to bed like at 12 a.m. and I've been literally doing this every day since I've been home like I'm waking up so early for no reason I'm just used to wake up early in general at this point I'm always waking up between like 7 to 10 a.m. and I guess during this time my body's like oh let's be up at 7 or something so that's honestly the reason why I'm awake um and I just for this part of my video I just want to talk to you guys it's my charger so I don't know I feel like with everything that's going on I feel like I don't want to talk about it but I mean I guess it's you know it's important to you know to share with one another like um just you know precautions um I just I guess it's important to understand that people are feeling a certain type of way right now and no doubt about it I am - alright Hoffman to be completely honest when it really like I guess when it really hit me that this whole like coronavirus thing is like I guess it's always been real but I guess when it hit me personally it was literally like two weeks ago or one week ago I don't remember but it was like literally on a Wednesday I remember I found out and like I've known obviously that it was in China and everything but I guess like once he started seeing numbers rise where you live I guess that's honestly the truth but like that's when you kind of realized and you're like oh crap like it's like it's a real thing you know and to be honest it also felt more real for me when like people started like the people that I follow for example and and assuming everything when they started posting that they really freaking out they were like oh shoot like it's here and like stock up on this on that and like the media just tells you to like I guess like have food ready in case we go during horn teen and I guess people started buying everything you guys saw like everything that had to do with like the toilet paper and like I don't know I don't even know what else people were buying there like with the water and everything like I guess that's really when it struck me and I remember that day I was littered I remember like sitting on my parents bed and I just remember I like I don't know why but in that moment when I was reading everything I think it was also the day that the president here he announced that like I think that's what he announced that like all travel to Europe was beyond so that kind of like made it more real and that was when like I it really like struck me I guess and I remember like I went in a full like anxiety mode and I felt like I literally like couldn't breathe I couldn't I don't know it's just all of a sudden happen and I remember I was just so shrestha and it was like in the afternoon on a Wednesday and then I remember like I went to sleep with like so much anxiety like I felt like so much fear like I don't know where like I was just worrying I was like I don't know it's just like it really got to me and then the next time was Thursday and I remember I woke up and I didn't feel right like I felt like I've seen so I had saw her remember I saw so many pose like even on textile talk and everything like people were saying and it just doesn't it was it was a weird day like the next day just didn't feel okay like it didn't feel right and I honestly thought the same thing like even here where I live I live somewhere where it's usually super sunny outside in that damn I just felt like what the hell like what why is it so like so even the weather was that it was literally cloudy and I just remember that day so vividly and I guess I was TMI but I remember I also started my period so I guess that added on to it and I just had so much anxiety and the next day - it was a Friday and then I realized I think I realized about Saturday Sunday that I was starting to get sick and I was like holy like I remember my I guess my symptoms where I had a really bad headache and every I don't have a thermometer but I'm pretty sure I had a fever because I was just so my body was so hot I remember I would touch my head and my head was so hot and like I told my parents and everything and they were like freaking out and I get away from me and everything and I was like it was bad and also I started freaking out more because I honestly never get sick like I've never had a real headache in my life like the one I was having and whenever I usually get fevers I don't I feel like I don't really take medicine I just don't really believe in it but the thing is when I got a fever like I I took like medicine and it wouldn't go away now it's like holy and then since I'm obviously Mexican like we believe in like traditional medicine and whatnot and so like my parents were like them that I own so I did it just wouldn't go away and my favorite literally lost it like I guess three days I remember Monday came around and I still felt the same and but when it came to my headache I guess it was just all the stress and everything but that was it that was only sometimes I was really having and also one other thing that I want to touch on is I was having like difficulty breathing to be completely honest I feel like that first I didn't really want to like acknowledge it because it's something scary to think about like that you can't breathe you know that it was literally like hard to like I guess got like air or I don't even know how to explain I didn't feel like choking it just felt like pressure like I couldn't get like a full breath of air you know and yeah so that was a bird what are the first things that also hop in a meme and during that week I don't remember it was last week or not I'm honestly losing my memory at this point um but during that week I remember I had like I don't know during that week I just I had like I remember during that week me and my mom I guess that's when they were just starting people were starting to say like saying doors and everything and everything that week was when I would go to like Whole Foods Trader Joe's and just stock up on random things and I was also buying a lot of Medicine I wanted to vlog that but honestly and I just felt so ill I just didn't feel right to even like film or anything and I've honestly never felt that like not that I've ever been to release like on camera like since I started like YouTube I guess but I just kind of felt like I know in the back of my head I wanted to but I just cutting cuz I was like so ill and yeah so we bought medicine I don't know if I've showed you guys in this video I think I did what are the first clips I bought like immune see stuff and like I mean vitamin C's I bought those autumn air gummies I got this other like powder and I got like and then the I better show a lot of other things but I also got like turmeric like two fresh turmeric garlic and everything and I started taking all that and like I don't know but I don't know it's just crazy how this all of this happened to be completely honest like you'd never think it's gonna like happen to you I guess and then it does and it's I don't know it's wild and I feel like the week after things started a really calm down not just for me but in general because I felt like I saw a lot of like more positivity I guess on the media and everything like even the people that I follow because people were like that's not really like freak out and stuff and I get people really over pying everything at first and then in the end people weren't over buying anything that much now if I go to this or it's still empty but it's not as I'm Deanna's like the first few days hmm and to be honest also like these past few days I've been feeling a lot of shortness of breath actually and I was kind of freaking out the other day again like two days ago which was welling today's Wednesday was like quite honest Saturday or Sunday I don't even know Sunday Monday Tuesday yeah I think it was like on Sunday or Monday I had like a lot of shortness of breath actually and like I don't know I don't know what to be honest and also I gonna touch on one other thing before I forget um I think it was last week on like a Wednesday it was actually one ago from today um I actually ended up calling like my health care provider just to see like I guess just to possibly get tested like I don't know but I called and I guess since there's so many people that like want to get tested and everything I might called and it was like a nurse and I was a guy and I'm worried like whenever my symptoms and everything and I told him and I obviously told him I have not traveled outside of the US in the past 14 days and he was like no like it sounds to me like it's just a small sinus but it's nothing it doesn't sound like you know the kind of virus and everything and I was like okay and but the only thing he told me was to call back um okay so I said let's get worse or I have like other new symptoms for example coughing which I don't have so that's that on that before I get any questions about that because obviously you know we're like the first thing you're supposed to do is probably like go to the doctors or something and so yeah that's pretty much how it's been for me personally I really wanted it just like got that out there and I guess just tell you guys my opinion and everything yeah yeah lately it's been better it's so beautiful here where I live like you wouldn't even think anything is going on because it's super sunny outside and everything but yeah it's crazy and I honestly feel for those who like for example like people have children like baby like who need like their formula and stuff I'm like Kent cutter for like the elderly like I obviously also I guess we all saw a lot of posts for like the elderly is now like allowed in the grocery store first and everything stuff like even the people that are already suspect like I can't imagine like I don't know it's crazy and I feel for everyone I really do and I really hope just it all goes quick I think that's what we all want we just all want the normal again so you know I just wanted to say that personally I mean I've always really been an introverted to be honest so this whole being inside thing isn't killing me but yeah it's a lot and I just if you're feeling anxious or stressed or anything it's totally okay it's normal I think that's what we're all feeling yeah I really do feel like the best things probably just for everyone to go into quarantine so that I can stop spreading that I mean they've already shut down everything I guess I guess it's and you know our hands to to like you know listen and obey and everything so yeah I just wanted to say that and with that being said I think in this video it's just a short little video I think I'm gonna title this like a day of my life or something and just include all these clips um I definitely want to make more videos on I don't know why I'm gonna have to come up with something so with that being said thank you for listening I feel like these are things that are just crazy times that we're living in to the honest um so thank you for listening thank you for watching thank you for the support and I guess I'll see you guys in my next video
