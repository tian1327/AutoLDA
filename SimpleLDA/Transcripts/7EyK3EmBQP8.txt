since it's thursday we watch the kardashians usually every night my mom and i will do something like a movie or a show 9 30 now the kardashians ended up not being on so we watched a movie and it was this chick flick on netflix called roped and it was very bad very very bad i do not recommend but i made a cup of detox tea i just like to have this as you guys know and see right before i head into bed so i'm just going to do my skin care and my nose piercing has a tendency to be infected so i like to do my nose piercing care and then i will get my bed finish my tea and then brush my teeth after my teeth but yeah usually around 9 30 when i do my skincare all right so i have my aspirin on my nose i set up my yoga mat for the morning and just put on my everyday earrings back on and i think i'm
