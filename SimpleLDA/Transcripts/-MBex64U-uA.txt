Twilight Zone look like good and there and I mother stop  all right turn is over today I had an all-male flight crew so that is everybody captain in fo and everyone else that I flew it today yo we got to talk about this way we we gotta talk stay tragic boys but we came out on top let's see  yo yo yo we are finally back in Virginia and just to like literally recap what happened born Sunday afternoon we call it a 6:00 p.m. flight out of Newport News to go to Miami coming to Miami I had to do Newport News to Charlotte Charlotte to Miami I got time I am yet like 9:30 last night got up at 5:00 a.m. this morning because I have a 6:30 show time to work on new work time flew the newer flew back Newark to Miami got off walk from off the plane over to the gate at American to catch her three we got back in like 2:45 called a 355 flight on American from Miami to Charlotte had a two-hour sit and then I just took the last flight to Newport News so Charlotte to Newport News and just got in at what not 45 minutes luckily it's a small airport so it's literally like off the plane in the car like literally this is the life that I have basically this is the life I have to live choosing to fly as a computer during this whole like pandemic situation because the fights that I was taking out of Richmond that were direct for enrichment to Miami easy two hours like they've just been cut this week so like I don't think that that is an option now it doesn't fly it doesn't go every day anymore today it was cool I got to draw all about trips this Mazar with my classmates because we all have similar Pacific open we all have similar security so we ended up holding all of the same type of stuff so like flying with Brian and Jes it was really cool we all live in like the same crash man in Miami because they were classmates it was cool it was quite a little bit of like issue with our turn coming back out of Newark but I literally had to write a report of all somebody because like what we're about to do is see the same mistakes happening every single time I work to turn and let it go I have about 20 more minutes of my commute until I am home and then we are all for two solid days that was the whole point of me just bite the bullet and coming home today instead of tomorrow once again two solid days off I'm gonna go back there as they boarded I work a turn and I'm probably just gonna stay I'm off Friday Saturday I was going to stay about you like to pull new stuff because I work both Sunday and Monday so that is de tentative schedule unless we are unable to get me if they will
