   hello hello I feel like a completely different person since the last time I made a vlog it has been it feels like it's been forever um let's see it is coded we are almost entirely all over the whole entire world in quarantine that means everybody should be um and that is just what we've been doing you would have thought I would have been productive and vlogging more and no I wasn't I have been extremely lazy um a while back I ordered a backdrop and have them taken the time to put it up and I realized that I had this idea that I could do it in the back little area in my bathroom where I have this super cute red velvety chair that I love and it's kind of working but yeah anyways um so let's see what's new I've been home since like March 22nd the kids have been home pretty much since then as well um I think that was our first week or the week before was and then basically the governor in Washington closed schools for the rest of the year so they are at home and they have about two more months of school it hasn't been that bad but it has been hard and some days I feel like I'm doing good most days I don't as a teacher but that's fine and the teachers know what's going on so overall it's fine I have been very happy to be home with the kids um it's not some that I get as much time to do anymore Steven and I have both been home and we've all been just lazy but honestly I'm okay with that I think what else are we all gonna have a time to all be home and not have any priorities or pressing engagements like we literally had nothing to do except for take care of ourselves and spend time together and I really enjoyed it I have been enjoying it um my work is trying to set back up to start and on the 11th um so I'm sure next week or maybe today I'll hear more about what's happening with that but yeah so we'll see I feel like there's so much to fill you guys in on I got my tattoo sleeve finished well not finished I got the next section worked on and I'm super happy with it  I got that done like a week before everything was closed and then my tattoo artists moved to Oregon which is fine because I even not that far from I think it's like a six-hour drive to her location I'm and I supposed to go actually tomorrow for my next session but I cancelled because first of all I don't know if she can't even do anything and I also didn't receive my unemployment until what was it this week so I wasn't sure if we could afford it and didn't think it was the right time so anyway it's really sad about it but it can wait it's fine another thing that we've been talking about for quite some time and we're actually going to be moving forward with is our good friends that moved here from California one of their mom's when they move she came along with them and she fell in love with how our little mini Aussie we have decided to let her adopt him and essentially a long story short he he's super loving super sweet but it as he's gotten older we've realized his little his means don't match our lifestyle and if this weren't a thing we would accommodate and it would be fine but this opportunity arose and we figured this would be a better life for him she lives alone she's lonely she was looking to adopt and she asked us if we ever were interested to rehome him that she would love to take him and at first I wasn't very sure about that I'm like well I mean that would be awesome but I don't really want to get rid of my dog but as you all know Kobe and Hal don't really get along Kobe loves how but hell isn't too fond of Kobe and you know we we want to get more dogs that we want to have big dogs so I don't know how happy that would my cow so we think that this would be a good move for him to have all her attention to live in the house without kids and other dogs so he's gonna be getting rehomed and we just found out Brendan our friend he'll be flying out with him so that way you know he's known him since the day I brought him home so and he's going with his mom and so that he's flying out with him at the end of this month so we have a few more weeks to love him up and say our goodbyes and then he'll believe me we also put a deposit down on a puppy we have talked about getting another larger dog especially since Coby and Hal don't play well together we wanted to get a thought like that Coby could play with but we also just want more dogs so we found a breeder that we love and we put our deposit down so we're still waiting to hear about the litter but we're hoping the puppy will be born this summer June or July so fingers crossed we'll keep you guys posted on that journey the other thing that is a huge exciting thing we are moving forward with our home buying basically we feel confident sealants truffles still remain he's been working this whole time and been receiving his normal pay so basically what we're planning is to just our leases up in August July August I'm so around that time to hopefully have found a house and be able to kind of like make that switch we're like beyond excited to start that journey and to get that started and you know get a house we have a decent budget but you know it is expensive in our area so we've been looking around I will probably start really like navigating that closer towards the end of the month as I stated in the past and most of you may be you know um we are we had to file bankruptcy two years ago and if you know anything about that you know how hard that is to recover from if you need loans or anything so we're heading our two-year mark and what that means we're eligible to apply there's a lot of great programs and stuff so we're looking to take a class on Monday actually for a home buying course that basically helps us with downpayment assistance which is fantastic and then we'll be getting a first-time homeowner loan probably and going that route so I cannot wait and I'm gonna bring you guys along on that journey I have been extremely lazy through this process I haven't been really cleaning I haven't blocked myself cleaning I clean every now and then as necessary but it's not like a big thing if I do start back to work in a week again get myself ready so I figured start this process get myself ready and then start pushing myself to clean more regularly because I'm gonna need that huh to help them that push funny is during this whole thing Animal Crossing has exploded it's like the biggest thing right now butts like Tiger king which is a whole nother topic and conversation um so I had never played it or really paid attention to what it was but Stephen was like you should probably look into it you probably liked it so all in like two days time we were shopping around walking through Walmart I saw a turquoise switch light it and was like you know what maybe we should just get this and I'll try out the game that's basically what I've been dreaming for weeks it's like animal crossing and fulfilling my destiny as a gardener and a DIY so if you guys are interested you should totally send me a request and we can visit each other's violence I don't know what else to say but I miss you guys I think about you guys I've just I'm extremely lazy um curious how are you guys doing what have you been doing anything crazy going on in your quarantine we don't personally know anybody that's been affected directly by it um that means like that has had it or that we know of at least but as a lot of people think a lot of us probably have had it or may have it and just a really mild fashion so who knows oh I sense I'm an animal crossing expert now decided to test my time in my work and garden skills and I brought Aria to the store and got some little starter plants and we planted a few vegetables on our patio so I'm excited or watching those I'm taking care of those and seeing how they develop I'll show you guys in a little bit but they're super cute and they're doing pretty good nothing's dead yet it's only been two weeks Oh I've also been just kind of inspired to have the house or organized thought I would do more like decluttering deep cleaning but not as much as I'd like but I do have a little spot it makes me so happy it's kind of partially still getting worked on so don't judge it but I know I love it and so have the things to add to it but it makes me happy so I have had a little clutter situation with my undergarments and socks and all that and I kind of wanted to have my own little dresser I thought this was a cute option instead of getting a dresser I just got to keep storage and have my stuff in here and then I also have room for like my crafts I have my diffuser a little plant and I'll probably end up putting like my vlogging like stuff here too for the pandemic started I was already kind of getting into I love puzzles and I found these Disney Kincaid Thomas Kinkade puzzle so I was like yes and I got them sorry about the glare but I am so obsessed so obviously that is Peeta theme and Mickey and Minnie just shelling in Paris I have a few others that I will be putting up my little happy place and I love it Kobe thinks this is his spot forever just my spot and gloves cardboard or paper or anything how would they be since I've been the creator creating everything you know those little cheat sheet charts I decided I would just make one because I always look it up on my phone so now I just have it and it's Totoro which is one of my favorites so super simple and it makes me happy so um I've got my cute little Dahlia plant up here so I was gonna show you guys my ardan that i have here on my patio but the squirrels are obsessed with trying to scare apart oh I absolutely love jasmine so I got this Jasmine bush thing I actually bought a terra cotta pot that I want to paint and then I'll replant it and that I also have my wonderful strawberries but I had to put little netting over because the freaking squirrels I have some carrots and onions Walla Walla in there they are doing really good I have some cucumber that is struggling red bell pepper serrano peppers green onions blueberry bush with any luck we'll have some stuff coming up at least maybe the carrots they look like they're doing the best in strawberries possibly but hopefully everything grows that would be amazing  you
