 what's up guys I am back and right now as you can see I am doing my hair I just washed my hair really good and let me show you what I applied I applied the clay this is the leaving conditioner I didn't see do anything for my hair at all my hair really needs moisture so I applied that didn't really see a big difference I don't like the way it smells just this kit and I thought that it was a little bit different but it's like it's this is a little bit stronger than this one I don't I don't really care for the smell I thought this will be something that I would like but or I think it's either 25 or 30 dollars I can't keep it so I'm gonna have to return it and the oil I won't know until let's see I won't know until after I want to use it once I flat iron my hair but I know that this old place is the business because there are other products that I've tried in the past is bomb and yeah so my hair is looking a little bit dry so I am going to blow-dry it and share with you all what I think about the products there were some other products that I picked up from the Sephora that I showed you guys in the video yesterday let me show let me share with our really quick the products that if I could find yeah this would be this kind of video I'm doing my hair why not okay the dermatological all-over toner i don't like the smell it has like oh it's not a medicinal smell it just has something I don't know if this the chamomile smell or maybe let me see maybe it's possessing me I don't know something about it I don't like and I have it I used it and I didn't use it on my face for a couple of days and I didn't see no difference but I am in love with their they'll wash their face wash I don't like this I guess right here I don't like this gold rush at all it made me look really ashy on the skin it's so pretty right it is so pretty and when you swatch it you see nothing but ash I don't want this in here I'm gonna use this on today I'm going to keep this and see that I'm gonna keep you guys know I hated this this is stupid I hate that what is this the cup re lip gloss that's just a waste of money you can just buy you can just buy the knees and you'll your lips to be poppin okay it just had high hopes for this this is the it lash blowout now I could tell when I like something it don't take me long to know if I like it or not this right here for $25 I don't think so even if I did get 20% off it's not worth it it's the it lash driver now some people like it but I have long lashes so I just I really like to lengthen my lashes and make them look really super black it didn't do it for me something about it I just don't know it just didn't do it for me the last product they gave me this beat-up box I'm on the fence about it's this pharmacy daily greens I've seen a lot of great reviews on it now the only thing I love the smell I love the formula but guess what I am a grease mess when I use this and I use this in the morning time oh it does hydrate but it leaves me so oily oh this is my like returned return box I don't like the product I love this Charlotte Tilbury you guys know I love this one right here it looks very pretty the bronzer from benefit is amazing and that's what made me you know want to try out I want to try out this thinking that always gonna be mom but it's not so let's go girl rush is definitely go back but I love the bronze that the bronzer is in caramel and it's super nice let's touch of liquid canvas is also bomb as well of those of you all who we're on the fence about it I like this one as opposed to the part that looks I have stuff like everywhere something that wasn't from Sephora this is the Trader Joe's this is the watermelon facial mist this is really good you guys get that it's a remover from Zoya you need this in your life you can find us at you don't Amazon awesome it is great let me show y'all another product that I really like so Oleg Hendrickson yes abran Anna bright face primer this is a good product

now those are the products that you should be checking out if you're interested in some makeup hair care what skin care yeah so let me finish my hair and we don't see we want to see how these two look I'm gonna do one side with this don't one side with this so it's the ways versus always   okay my love so I just finished blow-drying all this hair and now I am about to Flatiron it but first I'm gonna try out this all the place this is the number seven bonding oil and let me just tell you a little bit about the olaplex binding coil is this apply a small amount to damp or dry hair and Stowers is as desired then it also says it reduces frizz and flyaways extend color and renews fiber see heat protection up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and I have my baby list Pro flat irons these are the Titanium's and these are the flat ones I have it on for 10 so I'm safe it says it shortens drying time softens and detangles UV protection no residue color state vegan and oil free so I'm going to take a small amount this is my small amount I have a lot of hair I provide it to the hair okay it takes a drug it takes the dryness away and it doesn't leave your hair too oily if your hair is looking too greasy with this that means you use too much your hair doesn't supposed to look like greasy but it should still have a flow of Bounce body so I'm gonna finish up my hair you guys and I will come back once I complete it so that I can show you  okay you guys so I am curling my hair I am really digging it oh you look it's making my hair look so spooky from all that frizz all that frizz - silky hair I am loving it that's all I just wanted to come back and show y'all why always talking my hands okay I am doing the chase comb method I love this this is the crickey comb you can buy this at Sally's is it the chase column or the comb chase whatever it is you know what I'm talking about okay so I finished this - I don't have any arm edge control on the end on the edges just as of yet but I did curl half on my head and it came out really nice I like the fact that even though I use the oil it still has like the body and everything so I'm going to use the way on this side or maybe I should use it for the front yeah I used it on this side you know I like this smell though but I come in now okay so I'm going to use the way on the other side and  okay what y'all think I look like wait they both do an amazing job and I love the body the bounce and down I feel balanced in this I'm gonna curl this a little bit more tighter right but I thought I didn't like it but the smell is there but it goes away so mm-hmm I'm gonna keep it Oh feel like doing the whole returns and stuff like that so yeah okay so I will be back let me finish the rhythm I hate it because I want to put on some makeup today all right nothing is on my face I'm gonna go in with this cha cha cha cha the next thing that I need to do is these brows and this is a pencil that my job put in the auto bag that I showed you the bag like this that they gave it and although this is not my color because I am a brown girl I'm going to try to make it work and this is of the goof proof brow pencil by benefit  hey man put some more oil I love all you yes I just put on some loungewear and now I'm just gonna pull my hair down alright alright so now I'm going to use this instant control edge and beret gel this is maximum hole and you can find this on Amazon and this brush to place it on the edges so I can lay down so I am about to get off of here and make me something set because I'm hungry mmm and I'll be back I'm alone
