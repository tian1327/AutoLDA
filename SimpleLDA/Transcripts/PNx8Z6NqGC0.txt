     okay so I mean I'm not gonna put on a ton of makeup because I'm gonna put a mask on so what is the point um but yeah so I'm back in New York it's interesting and surreal and of course you know this is my home but I have been away for gosh like two months because I was in New Jersey for two months so it does feel kind of weird to come back um and I got back yesterday morning and I had to do major just cleaning of the apartment right getting a new roommate moving in I probably talked about that and I get a different video but my new roommates moving in so you know if anyone's had roommates before you have to like deep clean even your own closet space too if you can fit more of your stuff in because before I was able to use both the rooms so my stuff is just like kind of all over the place so now I'm like in that process of like be like Oh KJ it's trying to declutter but even though I do a deep cleaning every three months and I'm very organized a very clean I was using the other room as a studio so I have backdrops and I have studio sand and I have all my D pop shop clothes in there so I just need to get them like in here somehow so that definitely means I'm gonna have to like redo my room of it but that's also probably not a bad thing because it's a new season but yeah I went out yesterday because I wanted to deliver some boxes to or drop off boxes at USPS so I could get out people's D pop orders which if you are watching which I don't think in any stretch of imagination you are but if you are for some reason you've fallen upon this video thank you so much for being so patient because you ordered while I was in New Jersey and I could not get your product because I couldn't leave but nothing back I shipped it out so thank you for your patience it was weird New York is its it is kind of dystopian it's you know very empty too very quiet right now but then all the same it's still in New York you know I get to the corner of a Broadway Broadway in Brooklyn not in Manhattan I do listen who got money for that but I don't but it brought it was the segment yeah you know I know everyone's out in the corners smoking they do it dad no masks on and I was like yeah hello excuse me what are you doing do you not notice that everyone has their mouth covered come on so that was you know definitely not surprising unfortunately I could say that something not surprising but that's New York for you and so basically I'm gonna do is pop a brow on and then maybe a little bit of concealer just so I can feel fancy I guess um because where else am I going what else am i doing not much okay so that's the brows for concealer I have been loving these are the kosis revealer concealers Wow these are so dang good really really been loving them you get someone's identity powder minder eyes a little bit I don't like to bake but I do like to powder them a little bit just because okay whatever say you don't crease like it's your eye you're moving your eyes all over the place you know of course you're gonna crease the how about using is my milk makeup it's the blur is a powder I use both medium and light it really kind of just depends I'm like what I'm feeling but you know so this is should 5.54 right under my eyes definitely just to brighten them up I'm feeling a little dark under there recently maybe it's just the perpetual exhaustion of being in quarantine I don't know how do you guys feel because I feel exhausted more exhausted than I usually am and I feel like my body is just like girl no I don't know why I'm covering that because again the mask is gonna go on yeah looks nice this won't even be able to see so that's kind of that's like the nice thing about wearing a mask is you well you can't see my blemishes all right people party people were all right let's get dressed okay so now I'm in the second room and the last thing I got it's only 10 o'clock they say the last thing I need to do is just pack up the box for the buyer who purchased some shoes so let's see what is it okay so their name is Morgan so let's so basically I have my bit of markers here I like to write the person I know eirick person know who purchases for me so I have like the rainbow pack of sharpies in here you can see so I kind of like to match the Sharpie to just I am so cheesy good match to Sharpie to that I'm gonna grab a purchased know itself buy more tape  okay just like your what else it's time to go the new normal okay mask gloves which this small like I thought my hands are so small so cute these gloves is small honey always one kid Oh  now  t-phone first okay okay go I just want to show you the full look going out let's grab my Jaden paison lovely is so much then my cropped trousers with these leggings underneath and then just an oversized Eddie my noni bag bucket hat mask  back off my package super easily I was able to park at the Whole Foods parking garage and then I like talked to the security guard no it was like hey do you mind if I like is this after I grocery shop I was like do you mind if I am like just run over my package cuz Limited shipping store is directly across the street from Whole Foods I was like all right now we just shop cuz you're not you know it's just like shop and they gave us we'll leave whatever and he was like yeah it's totally fine so thank you sir for being so nice so now is the time we all know and love wiping down the groceries so I have my Clorox wipe for my phone and then which it's kind of hard for me because in my house I like to do let's use all natural cleaning products I'll show you what is whoa weird I literally just put this in yesterday brand new super clean gosh I don't know if there's something in my under my cabinet but I mean it wipes away but why would it be like attracting dust or is that dust I have no idea I was weird so strange anyway so I use blue lip I use blue Lance cleaning supplies and I love it it works so well it's the bathroom one pink this one so this is the glass cleaning one is it yesterday I need to use it again today and I don't know if it was because it was it came to own off and all of them came like actually they all came said on on and this is only one that was off so I was squeezing squeezing of course nothing was coming out and those are the change it on and then it would not stop dripping everywhere down the bottle creating these huge puddles on my counter is defective if it is it's nothing to know then got these so I got the starter kits are these and then I also have the foaming soap for the bathroom and the only reason why I'm not using its lemon soap for the bathroom yet is because I have these this is dish soap so I have that so yeah I'm using this first and I'm gonna switch to another cleaning this trip but this comes from a package free store so basically feeding to the Tara on the top I tear the bottle which means that way the bottle and then I just fill it up with the dish soap and then that's all I pays for what's inside and it's amazing a lasts forever it clean so well its unscented its all-natural it's clean and non-toxic it's amazing this one barely even looks like English anymore but this is a hand soap so I have this bear at the bathroom okay so maybe these over here cuz I'm sure you do some cleaning today alright now for the wipe down oh my gosh look who's calling my dad's calling I bought a ton of canned goods right so I bought coconut milk because I think when I make a shrimp curry tonight then I'm mom makes and it's delicious and it has coconut milks I bought two of those just so I have a good backup and then just things are probably would need right so tomato paste tomato sauce whole peeled tomatoes this is all going in back stock diced tomatoes about two cans of that and then yeah two cans of the unsweetened organic coconut milk so that's that and then I purchased I love this so this is Kochi Jeong which I just realized I didn't need this and I kinda want to return it because I already have a huge Kochi jogger I don't need it right and this is why I want to use the pantry check app because then I'll with know not to freakin buy it so maybe I'll be giving this away too and then this is a new one this is a new ramen that a whole foods had this is the spicy sesame ramen they never had spicy before so that's exciting and then the right the traditional one is miso and then I also get to show you she's still good so those are like the dry goods carrot chips always with hummus delicious and the Oh life mozzarella vegan cheese I feel like I'm kind of a gassed up because I had I had green tea this morning  this is why I'm gonna get side work for this area because this area first of all it's very heavy today but it's so massively full what am I gonna do is on the bottom because where else am I going to put them Donna this is a shrimp scampi pizza honestly should have put in the oven to get it up but I don't want to wait so here we are acquired more tape for the packages which is excellent it's one little less thing that I need to do so I just downloaded this new app and I wanted to show you because I don't know about you but when I go shopping I often always have like amnesia and never remember what I have in my house so I downloaded a called pantry check and I will show you what I do it's amazing so you open the app and you hit skin and I'll do for example this just kind in pepper right so all I would do is oh my God my friends text me sorry scan the cayenne pepper look for the expiration date which is usually like up here at the top so technically this is expired but it's okay UN to enter the expiration date and then you hit done and so these are all the foods I've done so far and I definitely already found multiples and then once you're done you just hit add it add to inventory hello again Oh super dark yeah we gonna lighten up a little bit so I just got back on a socially distanced walk with my friend Emily which was so nice to see you in person cuz I haven't seen any of my friends in person at all so that was so nice and it is like weird you know mm-hmm having to like be cautious and walk and walk around people and I was in New York there are like a ton of people so you can only distance yourself so much so it's like walked around walked around the park say the park was packed with people so that was like kind of crazy when in my head right here cuz it lightens up a little bit more yep so tonight I'm making shrimp curry so let me show you what I'm doing okay first things first so two cups of rice just gonna rinse it off and if sort of water runs clear just thing you know it's all right pretty clean so I'm gonna then fill this up attend due course for a quarter so it's two to one  or hostile ricin okay so the key is there you go to do it low and slow so I like to put this as low as it possibly can go cover the lid and then let that do its thing for eight minutes while that's happening we over that chop some green onions and slice them and then grab the shrimp let's see it pound of shrimp         all right yeah this is the final look of the meal Oh smells amazing I'm so excited to eat this sure that's my mom she makes the best food and it was just the best recipes
