  hi everyone I hope you're doing well today is first day May 14th and we were supposed to reopen tomorrow like New York City was supposed to start reopening but unfortunately it's not the case anymore and they're telling us that the earliest might be on June 6 which is three weeks from now and Ben is isolating for nine weeks now it's been long but it's confessed and I'm sure you know the feeling and the only thing I've been doing was just going to Central Park with Harrison and grocery store you know to go grocery shopping once every two weeks I haven't been going anywhere else and I'm craving like the city I need to go so I thought today is a nice day and it might be actually perfect cuz just go check it out I thought I would take my bike and go downtown and just yeah so see what it looks like so I'm not gonna just stop that much I feel like if I stop is going to be where people are not stopping and I have my mask of course and sanitizer and gloves if I need them yeah I'm just gonna bike down and back up in a few hours and yeah I've been very curious to see New York empty but I also want it to be safe and I didn't feel comfortable going downtown before that but this week it's it's like a weird feeling I feel somehow there's more traffic in the street and the city loop looks a little bit more alive so I thought you know what I'm craving a different kind of exercising just walking Arison and I have a bike so why not take advantage of it even though I have nowhere to go I felt like today I would do something different and bring you along and we can just experience it together and see what the city looks like I'm not expecting it to be as empty as it was a couple of weeks ago especially on a gorgeous day like this but yeah let's go check it out I have no plan really what to do I just know that I'm gonna go downtown probably down to Times Square and back up in Times Square is like a 15 minute 20 minute bike ride from here it's not that bad yeah so let's go and let's see what we find out  right I guess it's safe to take my mask off to talk to you as you can hear it's very noisy there's a lot of traffic I am at the Lincoln Center which is on 64th and Broadway at the crossing of Broadway in Columbus I came down Columbus Avenue and yeah Here I am it's only five minutes away from my place so I didn't invite to far yet it's kind of surreal because I had no idea that Plaza would be closed it's completely empty and you have some barricades so you can't go in and they put a little fun that's a little sign that it's pretty fun to read it's kind of weird to see something so empty that is usually so crowded because the Lincoln Center is where people like to just go and hang out and take some lunch outside and especially on a day like this it would be so full of people so I understand why it's closed but I had no idea if I was a surprise I also walked by the Empire Hotel which obviously it's closed everything is closed I think close is going to be the most used word in this blog but I will take my bike right now and I think I'll stop by Columbus Circle which is also a big hub full of people usually see what it looks like and I'll take you along so let's go I'm gonna start saying so a little bit less I don't know I need a new word to transition so if you have an idea let me know in the comments let's go    at the Columbus Circle right now and it's pretty surreal to see the only people that are around are just passing by or the mall is closed of course but you have to go inside the mall in order to get access to Whole Foods the grocery store so you have five people lining up right outside and apart from this that's it you have a few cab drivers out of park so we can take people and bring them home traffic going by but definitely nobody is just walking around just to have a good time it is really surreal to see everybody's wearing masks and being super respectful and you can like see when the people when the city is so empty you actually see a little bit more of the people and yeah it's very interesting now next I'm gonna go to Times Square and I'm very interested to see how it's going to look like especially because it's going to be no tourists yeah so I have no idea if it's gonna be crowded or not and they don't have grocery stores so I'm assuming Times Square is completely shut down and we'll see if we can access it and walk around a little bit let's go    oh my god this is nuts like there's nobody here like if you look around look behind me it is surreal again it's unbelievable I've never seen Time Square like this on such a sunny day like this place is so crowded right now I guess that's what it looks like when there is no tourists in New York City the city is completely empty and people are staying home the ones that are out they are wearing masks and that's amazing you have a little bit of construction going on and that's it like the shops are closed the restaurants are closed some of them are open on if you pick up the music you don't see anybody like doing music the only people you actually see are the naked Cowboys if anything goes bad like you know that they will survive they're still here I'm not sure they make a profit without the tourists but they're still in a good mood and the police is in a great mood I guess they're happy to see some people and yeah you find it's funny it's like it's empty but you feel that sense of community by looking at somebody else it's I even like if we're wearing a mask we are like kind of very compassionate toward one another and I've never thought I would see this in my lifetime is really disturbing to see such a popular place like Times Square is the most crowded place in the entire New York City and to see it so empty and I don't know there are not that many words that I have right now to describe this I don't really know when it's gonna resume to be honest it's it's weird to think back this is life now this is how New York City is and it's not New York it is not in New York City and we're still here we're still strong but then the energy it's so peaceful and but disturbingly peaceful not like a happy peaceful and I almost missed the people it's yeah it's I don't know it's I can't describe it I this is just my raw reaction right now just walking for a few minutes and taking it all in that nobody's here this is apocalyptic and Wow so let's walk around a little bit more and then I think I want to see Brian Park to end the tour and then the video and then I'll go home because I've been out for an hour now and I feel like it's time but yeah let's talk some more let's see both snicker boys and we see where it goes but never never thought I would see that in my lifetime I'm a lots of words if you know me that doesn't happen very often as you can tell I am pretty talkative but this is crazy look at this there's nobody like this is not a special effect nobody's here and yeah so let's see what we can do we're gonna go on the bike and Oh chase but I don't know what I'm chasing right now I'm just taking it all in that this is going to be light for very long time in York City with people not feeling very happy about going out and yeah Wow all right my stone let's go     you  alright this is the end of a walk I've just arrived in Bryant Park which is a park right behind me you have a New York Public Library and right this way is Times Square we are still on 42nd Street and this park is usually crowded especially on you know a sunny day like this with people picnicking and businesspeople just taking their lunch break and I used to be one of them I used to work not too far from here and that used to be my escape from work coming here for half an hour and just enjoying my lunch it's a little bit different you don't see businesspeople around but you see families so I guess a lot of people still you know our New Yorker can live and a lot of kids are just running around the grass right now and everybody's social distancing so well the police is there and being super friendly and it feels good it feels peaceful it's not as heavy as Times Square was it feels like people are at peace and it was good to see a little bit of New York I'm glad that I came down and I decided to bike today I needed this I needed to see New York even though it's not what I'm used to see and everybody else but it feels good to see that it's still around and you know hopefully soon even though I don't know if soon will come less than a month from now we'll be able to go on again it's going to be different we know that we're not gonna have the same New York as it used to be and it's kind of a bad taste in the mouth I don't know how to describe it it's sad but it's strong and you can feel it like right here in Bryant Park you can see New York is slow right now it's not like that it's slow people are still like allowed to go out and they're pretty responsible I feel like people have been more responsible in Midtown that what I've seen in the couple of past weeks in Central Park like they've been very respectful with social this seeing and wearing masks it's good I think like right now it feels like New York is healing and hopefully we can resume our activities very you know soon I miss it I'm not gonna lie but there is not hi this is home I don't feel like going anywhere else right now this is where I want to be and I hope I can stay here as long as I can but because if I had to leave I want it to be my decision but yeah it's still a very odd sensation to come to New York and I have no truest of no business people walking around and having empty spaces but I guess it's it for today I hope you enjoyed the vlog this was a little bit different it's hard it's like I'm trying to put my youtube channel up but at the same time I can't really go outside and show you what I'm used to so I guess you discovering New York the way I'm discovering it right now and it's just an adjustment so that's it for today I'm gonna bike home probably through 6th Avenue and check Harrison and we're gonna go to the park because even though I had my where I either in his walk and let
