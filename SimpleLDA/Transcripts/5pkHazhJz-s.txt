 good morning April 17 it's Friday it's my day off there are a couple things I want to get done I want to update you guys on everything there's a dub week but I'm alright I'm alright thanks for all your messages I want to walk around the city do something fun today I'm not gonna have a lot of time to do fun stuff so today would be a good day to do that and maybe if I have time I'll put some pants on maybe okay let me change let's go outside   here we are Times Square you see anyone around you see anybody nobody's here I'm in Times Square where where is everybody nowhere to be found let me find a good spot so we can talk so here we are in Times Square as you can see it's absolutely deserted it's insane I actually have a little story to tell you guys I was ready to go for my first day at everything prepared ahead of time I checked my emails i double-checked my emails instead of taking an uber I decide I'm gonna walk from the hotel to the hospital because that's gonna be my daily commute it's only a 35 minute walk no problem it's pouring rain outside screw it you know what if it's gonna rain it's gonna rain I should still walk the rain is like blowing sideways into me I'm getting all soaking wet there's this puddle it's not a normal puddle it's like a small swimming pool I got this I'll just jump over this puddle turns out it's raining I thought won't be that Bella does carry an umbrella well but I didn't calculate is that I don't have any shoes that are equipped for this so I don't know if you can see that there is an unavoidable puddle I tried to jump over it I ended up jumping into it and now my shoes are completely so I'm probably gonna have wet socks for the rest of this 12-hour shift so lesson learned huh how to spot a Californian what sucks shoes and what's locked the entire first day of orientation which by the way they messed up so I get to the entrance of the hospital this hospital is huge by the way I'm trying to figure out where the room is okay so I report to the front desk they said okay go go follow this pathway this pathway this pathway it seems like a long walk so I make my way over and I see this line of what I'm assuming our travel medical professionals I'm waiting in this line the lines going kind of slow cuz everyone is social distancing so everyone is six feet apart and the this pigeon is really close to me right now the table the booth where we're getting our paperwork is only serving two people at a time so it's getting kind of slow so finally it's my turn I get up to the booth and he asked okay name I say Timothy for all us he's looking through his laptop I don't see you on the list do you know your unit I didn't know what that meant so I just said respiratory was like I can't let me check he looks at respiratory he says your name's not coming up do you know a room you're supposed to be reporting in yeah I got the email right here it says I'm supposed to go to so-and-so room okay well we'll just have you go to that room grab a packet go to the room there's a bunch of people already there you're like okay so let's get start a little orientation blah blah looking at this packet and I'm seeing her DM RN traveler packet as I flip through this packet I'm realizing that the orientation is about glucometers all these devices that are nursing devices are thinking wait this is a nursing orientation everyone here is an RN I'm at the wrong spot so now I'm thinking okay I came here early no problem I'll be a little bit late I just got to find where the respiratory orientation is and I'll be fine I go back to the booth where they're doing all the paperwork the lady in charged there was oh did you find everything okay I told her my situation I told her hey I'm a respiratory therapist they sent me to the RN orientation I don't know where that is so she's like give me one moment she gets on the phone they're working on it hang tight for just a moment the worst thing possible would be for me to be stranded in New York without a job so I'm like okay hopefully they figure it out soon so I go to the cafeteria three hours pass I've basically sent a bunch of emails a bunch of texts up to everyone no one's getting back to me so I run to the front desk does anyone here know where the respiratory orientation is one of the ladies was like I have no idea and then one of the girls says I know we were supposed to go oh thank god I wish I did this sooner so I finally find the respiratory department there's one lady in there she's like oh you're your traveler yes I give her my name my name is not on the respiratory list I'm thinking what is going on am I not gonna have a job just just hold on one moment let me put your name in let me email a bunch of people and we'll go from there in the meantime you could go to this room and get your badge of course my name's on the system I wait there for another 20 minutes puts my name in the system boom got my badge so orientation was basically I got my badge I got my mask I got my name put in the system and then I went home so my first day actually working respitory I was following this girl she had 25 I see events all by herself obviously I was there to help her but I'm knew basically the day consisted of running around and keeping people alive so normally when you have a ventilator you're supposed to check the ventilator as often as you can these machines they can malfunction or the patients are not being synchronous with event meaning that they're not tolerating the event if the patient's not tolerating the event the patient's not breathing and my old facility we check the vents I see events every two hours sometimes you get busy maybe every four hours so here you're only expected to check the vent once per shift why because you don't have time to do anything else it was 25 of them all of them are coma patients all of them are critical all of them are dying and these Kovac patients they go from good to bad very very quick you got to respond right away Oster patients gonna crash and that is a lot of stress you have 25 of these there are some therapists we've had 37 I see can you imagine so normally if you have six ICU vents you're freaking busy when you're on a ventilator there's so many things that can go wrong and there's so many tests you have to run to make sure that the patient is actually tolerating the vent because the smallest change the smallest tweak can be the difference between a patient living and a patient dying and these code patients again they are like on a Razors Edge yesterday was the first day I was alone I only had 10 IC events only right that's a lot but it was it's definitely not 25 and it's definitely not 37 basically what I did was in the beginning of the shift I made sure that I got all my ventric done after that I was basically running around putting out fires like a small deviation in the ET tube like the cuff was slightly deflated the tube was positional there is a mucus plug so you got lavage a lot of the times the nurse just calls you and says hey my patients not doing okay can you check on them and you go in there and there's 50 things that could be wrong and you need to narrow down to though to the two things that could happen so that you don't waste too much time because if the patient is not breathing or the patient is not doing well and you don't fix them in two minutes then the patient is gonna die so yeah that's just kind of what the work is like you know you you document you chart when you can you do your vent checks if you can but your job is just to keep people alive and that's it there's a lot of critical thinking and it's actually a lot of fun I don't want to make it sound like I'm complaining or anything because this is why I'm here I'm glad that I'm here because imagine the stress of having that many kovat patients all that many ICU vents by yourself and now your work is cut in half you're still really freaking busy but now the patients can actually get proper care because you're not having to choose between going to this room or this room because the whole time your phone is ringing and you have to decide which patient you're gonna see first but hopefully now I'm being useful hopefully now therapists can actually take their time with the patients instead of putting out one fire while these three other rooms are completely ablaze if that makes sense  alright guys I don't want to spend too much time outside for obvious reasons and my hands are so cold right now I can't feel anything it's gonna go back to the hotel it's really cold up here yeah I just want to say thanks for all the support I know some weather you're falling on Instagram someone saw my post seem like I'm like sad or lonely or or whatever I really I really do appreciate all the messages you guys are sending me but I'm okay nothing that I'm I'm alright you know it's it's just a little bit lonely out here obviously I don't really have anyone to talk to you so I really do appreciate all the messages all the support it's just obviously it's really stressful the workload is insane and I don't really have any way to communicate to anyone so the messages really do really really really really do help so thank you for that I wasn't expecting everyone to be so supportive now they see that it just makes me want to work harder for you guys like I don't wanna let anyone down there they're just times where  you're there just times we ask yourself why am I doing this what do I have to like care hi can just I get just a screw it I'm not gonna try my best I'm not gonna try my hardest and that's not why I'm here I'm not here to just collect my paycheck and leave I'm here to make a difference in I just got to remember that but yeah just to wrap up I'll just keep this video shorter I don't know if it came out shorter I have no idea what I'm talking about I I'm gonna say it over and over again I really appreciate you guys you know messaging me and everything I'm fine I'm okay it's just everyone's stressed out all right in my this job is very stressful but it's it's also a lot of fun having all these these messages and all these guys backing me and just makes me want to work harder it just makes me want to do a better job with each patient there's so many times you're just tempted to like just say screw it you know I'm just gonna not I'm not gonna deal with this right now I felt like when I was working at a you know my other facility it's like well at least like I get to hang out you know because I've been there for a while and you know I get to talk to everyone and that's like kind of like my social time but right now I don't have any social time so it's a little bit lonely like honestly everyone's lonely right now I mean it's not just me it's not just me who's lonely everyone's lonely ain't no one that that's that's kind of the bottom line right yeah everyone has everyone has different tolerances for loneliness I think mine is pretty high I think it's just the fact that I know that no matter what I'm in a different state right now so most of my interaction is gonna be through messages and it for me for me that's a lot it means a lot so thank you guys I'll be ok trust me that's it hopefully this video was interesting hopefully I'm not boring you to death because hopefully I'm good I don't know what am I talking about I should just I don't what am I saying this video sucks on
