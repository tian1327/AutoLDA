 hey guys it's me champino took my mask down because it's really hot um christine's really hot um and right now we're on our way to go buy some expensive oregano and uh then we're gonna walk back home today's day is very chill very relaxed the weather is nice like i keep saying like it's so weird that we're in a pandemic and we got a quarantine outside because it's like summer's hot outside uh quarantine time because it's summer time is coming up and like summertime in new york is so much fun so the fact that we have to quarantine is annoying come on it's not a great life the fact that we have to stay indoors is so annoying but we don't understand those we can stay outside but like it'd be just better if life was normal i was also thinking earlier seeing all these people with masks like when i was in japan it was weird but i got used to it but now seeing it in new york like seeing people with masks is so interesting it's almost like new york with a different texture pack you know but yeah right now we're gonna go to williamsburg williamsburg is like the most popular city outside of manhattan it's not even a city but i feel like it is a city like neighborhood it's a very popular populated popular oh man look at the police even the police you're in the police or er have face masks everybody has facebacks but yeah it's just interesting seeing new york with this pandemic look very very interesting look at these houses i don't really care some nice ass houses like brown stones super sick guys i don't know if you can tell but yes i did have an education i went to high school and this is it i know what you're thinking man champino that looks like a prison it's because it was i hated school i hated school because of the importance i set on it in my own head if i were to go back to school right now i'd enjoy it a lot more i enjoyed the people i enjoyed a lot of the teachers but i just took it too seriously i cared too much about the opinions that this place imposed on to me but now looking forward in retrospect christine learned retrospect today is that today here did you learn that word i just be teaching christine words bro look at all of these like doggies hey guys so there's the day after but the video was short so i wanted to add a little uh just talking session to this video today i have christine she's my roommate yeah um and i kind of wanted to talk about the pandemic a little bit more i feel like i didn't get into it a little bit enough um but i thought christine would be a good person to talk about it too because her trip got cut short um should i summarize it she was on a trip and then it got cut short no you don't need to go into the details about the trick no i know that how come it cut your trip short and what you were doing well well covet changed the whole my whole idea of what my trip was gonna be like i was supposed to be going to way more countries and i had settled just i mean i didn't settle but um i was supposed to spain bali for a month and then go to singapore for a day and then go to vietnam that didn't happen instead i went from bali for a month and i went to australia for a week and then came back home uh i don't know why i mean hawaii was my connecting flight but um i had woken up one day and something told me i should go home and i'm just like something told me i should come home and then i was like  my gut feeling let me just let me just buy a ticket back let me go to australia for a few days and then go back to bali so i spend 500 and i pay for a round trip thinking i'm gonna come back to bali and then my uncle gives me a call and he's like hey you should come back home and i realized that i shouldn't have bought that ticket but i did and um yeah so my solo trip was supposed to be this three month long trip going throughout like i think it was like eight countries i was gonna go to and i ended up doing two and now i'm stuck in quarantine which two months two months in quarantine yeah but i mean it's okay like my situation was i think better than everybody else's because i got to live freely for a month and a half by myself beaches and every you know i was having a blast so to compare my situation to others you know i had i had it better rather than people who were here working in the cold coming home and now they're stuck at least i got time to you know breathe and live on my own and it was a good experience and now i that was such a good like trial too because now i know for my next time i can pack way less i know how much you know how much things cost more or less what to do so like it was a good it was good it was a good experience for me but um with quarantine yeah i definitely wish i didn't have to be stuck at home but yeah i i can't complain yeah i feel like i'm gonna do the same thing too with like puerto rico going to puerto rico having fun for two weeks but then um being stuck here like i don't really know really like going outside if i go outside like 30 minutes um i'll go to like manhattan get a drink and then come back um but i feel like it's just the fact that i can do that like even if i wanted to i can't do that is what bothers me yeah and also the fact that um i had so much business opportunity and then it all disappeared because i covered um but i feel like oso covered it um gave me a lot of thinking time um which i really like i don't really put myself in situations that i don't like like this feels like uh rose kitchen like i remember going to rose kitchen in my job and like having to do like a 12 hour shift and i just got there and i was tired because i just woken up like an hour ago and then the customer walks in and you're like hey so like this is what this feels like it's like being put in a situation that i don't want so it's like very humbling very eye-opening too now i know that when this is done i'm going to take not i'm not going to take all the things i took for granted before um and i'm also going to try to get more done with like my freedom of like travel and stuff like that and not just sit around and wait for  dab and actually like take action yeah i want to add something um i had also before my trip i was so not stingy but i like if my friends were going out it was like i'll go but i'm not you know i'm not gonna have too many drinks or i'll go but i'm not gonna eat or just because i would eat at home or i'd just want to save so much money for my trip because i thought i was gonna need it all not knowing that i was gonna have to come home less than half of what i thought i'd be out there for so it really made me feel like damn i could have went out that time and spent that money or i could have went out that time instead of working and taking care of those dogs or walking those dogs you know so i feel like i should you know live life and just live in the present because you don't know what the future is going to hold and being so picky i'm not living life right now who says you're gonna live life later because you might get quarantined so yeah i did learn that much yeah well guys if you guys like this video make sure you drop a like um i don't really know what i'm doing
