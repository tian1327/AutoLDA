 there is a line for some reason you can see some people in line over there but why hi bags you ready to go are you ready yeah you're ready he's so excited he keeps on looking at the door I know we're gonna go soon we're gonna head out now  I actually wanted like gourmet doughnuts so we're going to Seattle freeze in Georgetown and I think this poor a teen stuff is kind of like or we put ourselves kind of itself quarantine so we don't go out and we don't have to but I think that's been messing with my head because it's a beautiful day today and I am tired I just got out of that house to get some fresh air I'm not trying to stay out too long but grab some donuts vbe and then just head back home somebody's super eager to get out of the car right Frank see you're super eager he just can't wait look at him honks see wait he just can't hold his his uh his excitement hey guys I'm back in the car and that was an epic fail because apparently Seattle freeze is permanently closed how come I didn't know that I looked it up on Edwin's phone and I don't know where I was looking because I'm pretty sure they were showing me the hours and then of course I look on a different place or in a different area and then it says permanently closed Bronx's being carried right now back to the car if I Edwin so we're just gonna go to watching my out which is like a Japanese store in downtown or in Chinatown and we're gonna get these other donuts called doh cheese which is the mixture of donut and mochi hey rag you put back into the car but oh well that's where we're headed now usually pretty busy especially weekends but it's pretty dead there's yuki-onna processing okay so on the left you got strawberry Pocky and then on in the middle top is that ooh big glaze then this is the matcha Oreo and then I got two of the taro fruity pebble and they're supposedly a mixture between like donut but more like mochi so I'm excited to eat this you deserve this yes I do I do I've been waiting for friggin doughnuts for like we also stopped by Oasis to get some bubble tea I got peach green tea and then we got taro we're at Costco again the next day I know because there are two things that we need to buy that we forgot about yesterday and it's hella MD all these parking spots here are empty and there is a line for some reason you can see some people in line over there but why look there are people like light up there and I don't know why what's going on it's not too crazy but there's like lines behind these cars like you can't see why we're home now Costco is crazy they made you stand in a line I think just because they don't want it to get overcrowded and I don't know what else but anyways they had toilet paper and everything but fortunately for us we bottle a new pack of toilet paper probably about a month ago at this point if not a little bit over a month ago cuz my mom was talking about how to prepare you know for everything and whatnot so took care of all that we just forgot a couple of things to buy yesterday and of course Edwin and I got into a little argument which I feel like what for married couples you fight about one money to a family three what's the third one I felt like there's another one money a family I think that's really it I think it's normally about money and like your in-laws you know but I don't know it all started about how about last year yeah last year we're talking about you know looking for a house starting about March and I think the market is kind of turning at this point which is perfectly fine like I'm okay weeding it out and whatnot but to me I get most frustrated when we talk about something and then there's no action being taken place if that makes sense or you know even if we decided not to then we can just you know make it known that okay let's hold off a little bit and see what the markets gonna do you know but the fact that like nothing else is being said after our last conversation it's kind of like okay what are we doing here you know so I get we got into an argument over that that's how it started and then what else yeah it's just difficult when like you're married and you don't you don't know how to approach finances obviously edwin is a breadwinner and he pays for majority of the stuffs and then I usually supplement some of the smaller stuff like groceries but I also have my own bills that I have to take care of like my car payments and car insurance then you know everything else so I don't know he was under one assumption when I was under a different assumption and the assumption that he was under doesn't make sense because he's not doing this one particular thing that he would have to engage in to basically make his assumption true if that makes sense so to me I was like there's a disconnect there so how could you be under that assumption you know um so yeah I mean it didn't end badly or anything it's just like stressful stressful when it comes to finances and were you allocate what and okay I'm gonna stop bending I didn't mean for it to be like a ten-minute venting session but that's what I ended up being so I'm gonna eat some chips because I'm actually hungry these on another note are probably one of my favorite chips lane salt and vinegar these are my favorite look at Bragg see hi hi I thought you were taking a nap so cute yeah oh yes yes I'm trying to eat one of these today sweetie panel than what I was looking forward to eating oh I dropped it all over my shape how do I feel about these I'm not sure it's definitely not as oily as like regular Donuts it's definitely on the two-year side um not as sweet I feel like volume wise like when you look at it it's less than a doughnut but I think it's more compacted in there look let me tell you what the pricing is for a half a dozen it's 16 half a dozen $16 I don't know that it's worth $16 but at least we can say we tried it I am meal prepping basically he's gonna make what is it pulled pork taco so I'm gonna prep everything like I need to marinate the pork overnight and whatnot then I'll make edwin's like lunch for tomorrow   breakfast sandwiches all complete I put Eunice Kraft singles apparently you can't call that cheddar cheese or cheese and then under here is a sausage let me see if I can get some oh yeah there you can see it sauce head on top is an egg and then I'm just going to close it and then pack it up in the foil and then we should be good to go let me show you guys what I went to nourish them to get because I got the wrong one like I was saying are you hungry I feel like you might be hungry okay so I got this Dior Addict lipglo oil which is what I meant to get to begin with and of course I wasn't really reading I just read the color to make sure I got the correct one and that was it this is a lipglo oil whoo you can see my reflections look Bronx's looking at it like it's time for him to go after it leave this one okay bronzy leave it this is mommy's the lipglo oil color Reviver cherry oil I think they infuse cherry oil in it but it's pretty cool rocks you watch them you have a moment to try some on you I don't think it would be very good on you but yeah and it's a little bit sticky it's definitely shiny but not too sticky which I don't like so I'm gonna start using this to moisturize my lips yes Frankie do you want to show everybody your new toy yeah it's baby Captain America huh yeah it's baby Captain America disinterested Bronx you love that toy you always loved every single toy for 2.5 seconds and then they're garbage huh mm-hmm I don't think that's very very nice of you you have to be more appreciative you know you don't work and you live the best life don't you Bronx that's not very nice I'm talking to you hello don't act like you don't hear me DAW thank you for watching we will see you next time bye
