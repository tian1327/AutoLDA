boxing or the packing process I also recorded parts of the moving process and and also what the apartment looks like the painting process it was crazy so I have another vlog coming soon I just have to get more pieces to add to the house before I show keeps it I live in an apartment building that doesn't allow us to play loud music so that's a downfall but I like the space it's finally ours Liam has his own room and everything is very chill everything's very chill except for the fact that I can't enjoy my new apartment yeah because even though I'm in my apartment this quarantine stuff is something out there is something else literally a week after moving in here I almost had a panic attack because or was it a week I think it was two weeks after moving in here and I started working from home I almost had a I had a panic attack actually I had a panic attack I just didn't feel like things were moving in the right way I was so tired of seeing the space even though I was excited to be in my own apartment I just didn't like the fact that I can't I couldn't step out and we still can't step out there scorching stuff is crazy and it's so sad because I did mention that I can even play loud music in here but the building across from mine is allowed they're allowed to play loud music and my boyfriend and I we just sit by the window sometimes just listen to people play chat time in game signs that we just like live vicariously through them it's so pretty what someone's playing right now right now someone is literally playing the music now it's just crazy I just feel like you just have to be very careful out here but everything was going on you've heard it many times that I'm definitely desire you stay your ass home please we need to honestly do this is so cliche and so corny we touch the honesty's stay home if you can okay if you can stay home and stop spreading it just stop it those little Cody's those are you doing your house inviting people over it's not cute it ain't cute no more in a queue number get your ass home oh and I don't even have a proper chariot for my blog in the space I'm sitting on a little stool or little a little basket that you put blankets it's really cute the theme of my apartment is kind of like industrial very cozy but not overly cozy and I really can't wait to show you guys but going back to this thing home to you guys I'm dead serious people are losing their jobs so many people I know have been laid off I have to lay off the people in my job and it was not fun it was just it's not fun then kudos to all of those essential workers up hold on I'm gonna combine myself I can put it in one box thank you kudos to all of those essential workers the people who really just have to go outside while our asses are still home okay people are dying off my father just told me that two days ago someone in the building I used to live in passed away and he left three kids and a wife and it was just so sad it's one of the saddest things ever it I am definitely taking precaution because I have a seven-year-old and my boyfriend and a large family and I definitely want to leave anyone so I'm making sure that I'm washing my hands and I've always been here's the thing about this whole thing all right it's how you don't wash your hands and if you have been watching hands before of this you were asking also all right you are so nasty you need to make sure you wash your hands and then you're coughing if you are single you put it on this mess you've heard it many many times before but you need to make sure that you're doing it because I want this to end my boyfriend's birthday was spent in this house drinking and smoking hookah also we also spoke up you cur but it was I felt so bad we made a little thing and you can I put it up on my idea stories it was crazy it was crazy to know that we couldn't go outside to meet her trips planned and we will be considering going down to Puerto Rico and we just could him we are sick we could not we couldn't do it it's horrible it's horrible because we were one of those people actually considering those really really low airplane ticket prices we were in legit considering go to Puerto Rico the weekend Claude Agassiz clickers we just wanted to live but then we saw those numbers increasing in the state of New York and it's not good so so many people have gotten sick it's crazy my son is like he is taking classes remotely luckily his teachers have been completely supportive and his classes aren't so difficult the structure isn't so difficult they structure really really well so I'm like super appreciative with that and Mike was here helping me throughout this entire process also listen all I know is a it is natural for all of us to be buggin out just a little bit just a little bit and I don't want to see more people going away and you honestly sometimes you think like yo our people really is this one of those things where it was the virus was created what I didn't get into that but is it is it was it made or whatever to reduce a population those are topics that we have had conversations about and they're a little crazy thank you they're little crazy but I'm hearing so many people who are racist against or just don't want anything to do with Asian cultures right now and Cairo now the beer which I love so much going losing business it's just so much ignorant just watching a goddamn hands this bunch of eggs hmm Liam just asked I'm gonna show you at my friends nope I'm a fat person I have my children I don't get that much light in my apartment see happy the one person who gets the most lightness of entire apartment is Liam in his room he gets a large amount of light and then it trickles down this is like over a Roadhouse type of former railroad where's like his room my room the living room the bathroom there's a hallway than the kitchen in the entrance to the apartment which you'll see in my my blog the apartment tour I can't really have so many plans because in his room I can't put all of my plants and we need indoor plants that are low light plants and that's a whole other thing but I'm a plant person I've always been about increasing the amount of green you have around you I'm a tree hugger all of that so you're gonna see a lot of my plant babies in my video leave actually have some cacti in his room which I don't know even leave their by you want to bring one to shoulder of course he picks up the most dangerous one bang of it Megan Taylor was one of my babies I'm sure that's wrong I don't leave it in this room because look at it do the machina a little 7 you're all getting stuck by all of this yeah so I don't even his room I just put it in there to get as much soon as possible oh so on or not okay Laurel dockets you know that's how the one in his room look you're showing your clients in this video mmm the cutest one my little succulent but yeah green space it just makes me feel happier it's a lot of work though but listen that's we do well marry now I'm still working remotely I just feel like be honest be very careful with what's going on and don't touching huh and when we touch exactly mmm-hmm very good boys you have a smartass child be notes nobody could sit in the house no bad deed nobody could see you in the hospital it's so sad that is so sad but I worked out once and worked out once just once it was exciting I was looking at what Michael and it was just once and that's the longer we hear this and the he did and I'm better than it I just love working out I love sweaty of all that wood I love it the excitement so I worked out once just one day but in reality this entire time should also be about you wanting to work on yourself if you are working in a profession where you don't like to work in a profession just make sure that you really build yourself out what are some hobbies that you are liking to do or wanting to do things you want to accomplish and you accomplish them probably sure there's a lot of carrots can you build yourself while being at home are you an employer now you could I think unemployment what are you doing with that money if you've already bought everything in from your house invested in yourself really put this time and make this time about you and how you will build yourself so but you're no longer an employee and another person's company when this all goes back to normal and so there are some things there are a lot of hobbies that I want to partake in I also download rosetta stone so I can find so that's my Portuguese my Brazilian Portuguese and Lana water a Brazil maybe from Everett de Morgan's I really hope really hope that all of this is over before my birthday in August you how sad it is going to be for the summer to be like this Liam's birthday is in August also exactly fine find the girl and that girl look good and that kid but honestly I really hope that all of this ends before this war mama oh just now just do it now I love working them all but I want to work them all on my own terms do send me on my own terms I don't like knowing that I can't exit my house and feel like the air is dirty outside it is crazy climate climate change come can echo no viruses of white pick easy out there stay safe I will continue doing weekly updates daily updates I don't know all right download it tick tock I don't know tick-tock trying to make that a thing it's exciting I'm so posting on my IG stories trying to be as social as possible and really show a lot of myself look guys I love you guys I love you guys please stay safe protect yourselves protect your family and make good decisions but don't remember don't forget Wow don't remember don't forget but this should be the time when you really are working on yourself and trying to have as much as as much fun as possible if you're going through something make sure you're talking to people call your friends face assignment if one guy call the other one you know what I'm saying like squeeze your family members hash out some problems because you don't mean hash our problems virtually right now so you'll have to do in a person do something with yourself that does not keep you on the couch that has you moving that has you feeling a little bit happy do something okay and I hope to see you guys soon I hope that you guys have subscribed to my channel and then you like
