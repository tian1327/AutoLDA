all just a random one by itself it's a diuretic and then these are some muscle relaxants so luckily for my program the school mandated for us to get these Sigler drug cards so everything is kind of laid out for you so you don't have to worry about trying to find information and piece things together so that was really really a huge help so as you can see as I showed previously I just kind of highlighted some of the main important things that I should focus on and then I just wrote the drug name so that way I can't associate the name with the information so the stuff I'm not just repeating this I've already studied these cars all of the cars have been highlighted so I'm just going over them I have one the way now to get some gas and then I'm gonna need to pick Dave up take him to the

a few videos so I want to end this video by you know telling you all don't be afraid don't be afraid to do what you what God has put on your heart to do you know sometimes I feel like we all talk ourselves out of things and we don't know that the blessing that is within something that we have been wanting to do so just take a sip I don't save I know it's hard sometimes but just take a take a leap of faith trust God and all things are possible so what that means in I'm just gonna in this video here and I'll be seeing you on in my next video
