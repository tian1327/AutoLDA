I've been doing online school now it's Friday March March March 27 I woke up and I was like you know what I'm gonna blog my quarantine date I thought it might be interesting I've been doing online school now thought it'd be nice for you guys to see like how I deal with all of this obviously it's a terrible situation that we're going through and there's really not much we can do besides just stay inside and not go out so if you're on this planet Earth please stay inside doesn't matter what country you're in stay inside anyway now I got that disclaimer out of the way it's currently 10 18 I just had one online class and then at one I have my chemistry zoom so we're gonna do that I don't really have like a set schedule for every day it kind of just revolves around the classes and homework I have I haven't eaten breakfast yet and I haven't worked out yet which is a thing I wanted to talk about so it recently started working out I've worked out four times in these two weeks which is that bad because I just started working out like I haven't worked out in a year now that I have kind of this free time I started to do it again and I worked out four times and I'm pretty proud of myself and then I'm gonna shower probably I'm gonna need some breakfast and then I'm gonna go join my other class yeah it seems like a solid plan let's get started this is our workout gear quite nice I'm wearing this kind of green bone colored sports bra from set activewear and then my leggings are from a low they're really cool and then my shoes are from Puma we're gonna work out but I noticed I'm hella blushed and that's your dessert playing money worry about coming feeling like the rain waiting no three are you mean we got the heat so pump out anxiety you hit it to the side of Stein I feel like I'm glad honestly let go once you sing that you had a better chance without [Music] [Applause] [Music] tell me what it is tell me where today trigger-happy you looking buy I might just a night tell them do sick and far back in the county I'm crazy then I'm gonna shower my workouts are about like 45 to an hour long I don't like to overwhelm my body yet because it's still early days and for the workouts I kind of just watch my old workout videos because they work they're perfect for my body types and I'm the one who made them and yeah they just work well with me so I'll leave the link to that playlist down below I've pretty much memorized the workouts by now anyway right now I'm gonna go shower because I stink and I want to just be clean so let's go I'm not doing my intense skincare routine because breakfast started like thirty minutes ago so I'm just putting on some moisturizer that my skin is dry it's 11:00 a.m. now oh no nevermind it's 12:00 I have a class out one so I'm gonna eat breakfast in this hour I'm making one slice about avocado toast and then I bought this PR packet from your ad with like literally a blender and a bunch of like ready to blend smoothie like ingredients this has carrots mango papaya pineapple ginger tumeric coconut oil pea protein and chia seeds so it's really easy you just get your liquid this is my liquid it's kaffir and it's peach flavor we're like sticking with orange colors today it's very very orange and yellow in there here oh and juice even my straw is orange if this is bad I'm gonna be sad you can really taste the ginger to ears but it's not like bad I like it we're good so this is where that smoothie mix came from this is the big-ass box that they sent okay wow this is really pretty in the middle we have two products this is a brightening serum and then under it we have a dark circle corrector and then this one is actually a blender this is a Vitamix and then this one has all the other foods inside oh my god this is just so crazy thank you so much Murad I love you guys they've also been using essential oils cuz you know I'm cool and the one I have in side right now is this one it's sweet orange Wow literally everything I'm using today is orange and this is gonna boost my happiness so let's see I my class starts in three minutes I love that like I literally love it I got that wrong I don't know why but I
