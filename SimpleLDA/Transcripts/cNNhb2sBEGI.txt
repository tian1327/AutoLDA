  hey guys welcome back to my channel if you're new my name is Murphy I live in New York City and I wanted to just give you guys like an updates been going on in this beautiful world we live in as you guys know we are in a corona virus epidemic and this is a way for the government to scam us to be honest because they want us to spend more money so they can do whatever they want to do with that so they try to instill fear into the world and you know when you instill fear and people start to spend money that they normally wouldn't spend on like a every day it's not for that my job called me and well we have my job called me and to let me know that we will be closed until further notice so I'm going to be home it's just because of like the corner Vargas is really annoying and you know but I guess we'll have to get through it I just want to let everybody know that lives in New York City please stay home if you don't need to be outside and if you are outside just try to you know have your hand sanitizer have your gloves have your face mask I'm gonna do a quick little vlog I'm going to show you my past couple of days I'm like what's been going on I want to was they'll feel mall with my boyfriend and it was just a ghost town like barely a ghost town and then I went to Trader Joe's like literally there's no fool app everyone done stocked up and I'm just like in my head is just like Trader Joe's is mostly like produce and like this one lady she had it was her and her man and they have two carts each filled with like fruits and veggies and I'm like how many people live with you is there like 50 people I live with you because you know what's gonna go back in a couple of days so but you know I mind my business um yeah so I'm gonna show you Trader Joe's it is completely empty like literally everyone is just like taking everything all these places aren't making money because they are hiking up the prices especially with the cleaning products tissue paper toilet paper anything paper you name it they're hiking it up for my job I was ordering like supplies and for a bottle of own life so they was charging twenty four dollars for one bottle and I went to Bath & Body to get you know that cute little the little hand sanitizers they're completely sold out in every location I went to three they were all sold out and they're not getting any shipment until the following week and then I went into a regular deli to get a small hand sanitizer and they're charging $8 a pop like no thank you you can keep it so luckily my boyfriend he had already he had a couple of Lysol I mean hand sanitizer is at his job so he gave me a few I gave two to her to my roommate I kept mine I kept the rest but this is like ridiculous this is ridiculous but you know this is what's going on in the world we are nice to live in reality not in a dream world and this is pretty much what's going on I'm gonna take you to the mall me and my boyfriend we went to Roosevelt Field mall that mall was like a go sound if you ever been to also feel mall it is always lit and there's always people in there shopping but literally I can count how many people were in the mall and a lot of the stores were closed Apple I don't know if it's for that location but Apple was open but they you weren't allowed to go inside the store so what they did was in the opening they may like this they put like tables in front of the door and if you needed something they will go grab it from the floor and have you play with it or whatever and then that's how they did it so that location wasn't actually closed and another thing we went to hmm we went to Zara and we went to like a couple of other stores and any store that's apparel you can go in and you can shop but you can't try on anything which is like then you might as well have stayed closed because like I'm not gonna buy anything that I can't try on so I was just like great and I was like great so then my boyfriend he wanted like these pair of pants but they told me you couldn't try it on it's always like a right buy them go into the bathroom try them on if they fit keep them if they don't fit then send them and obviously they fit so he kept them but it was just like crazy everybody had their gloves on which was fine but literally when you go into the stores everyone is like literally my so yeah like I I really don't know I don't really know what to say so you know if you want to go out go out take the question and just avoid a large crowds but the streets are empty even Times Square Times Square is like Taurus Ville there's a no one when I say no one there is literally no one I'm gonna do my best parts to stay healthy and avoid large crowds but at the end of day I'm going to live my life and we're just pretty much gonna do that
