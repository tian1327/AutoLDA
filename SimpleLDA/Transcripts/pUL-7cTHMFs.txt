      whose turn is it whose turn is it I was in New York City yesterday it was a pretty day there is a density level in New York City that is wholly inappropriate you would think there was nothing going on in parts of New York City you would think it was just a bright sunny Saturday I don't know what they're not understanding this is not life as usual none of this is life as usual this is just a mistake it's a mistake it's insensitive its arrogant its self-destructive it's disrespectful to other people and it has to stop and it has to stop now this is not a joke and I am not kidding we have now tested 61 thousand people newly tested 15,000 people and that's why you're going to see much higher numbers than anywhere else remember cases 15,000 total number of new cases 4,800 new cases it's going to be four months six months nine months for the same yesterday North techne is too often right now because it's mostly just numbers and tallies and things like that those numbers are not representative of anything tons of people have the coronavirus and are very sick from it but they're not tested and so they don't get added to the numbers the numbers are greater than we're led to believe to people very close to me have it seems like everyone issuing state home orders basically around the country New York City has full basically quarantine shelter in place order whatever you want to call him happening at 8:00 p.m. tonight everyone is worried about paying the rent everyone I know what my job just got fired most of those people don't have savings of maybe a few hundred dollars because everyone's just living paycheck to paycheck like every single person who lives in Brooklyn bed-stuy Bushwick is just for their poor hipster or they're just a poor person what are we supposed to do it's the 22nd we basically have to mail our rent checks in a couple of days I don't plan to we have enough money to pay one or two months rent and then also eat for those two months and then after that we have no money and so we can't pay rent or eat if we don't pay our rent at all then we can maybe eat for six or seven months if we have some savings it's either gonna take a savior or we're just gonna suffer nothing we can do will get us out of our hole it would suck if the landlords are the only ones coming away unscathed just hoovering up rent from everybody the landlord should suffer in time also supplying the ship simultaneously it's actually big supplies going into the ship's big and that ship will be coming up here over the next few weeks and we'll probably be putting it in New York Harbor I see hospital ships on each coast listening to describe trauma strikes for fear and terror that deepens your heart remember meet the me to movement do y'all remember  2016 that was a bad year huh  2016 and prints 5 ah  damn leaders Prince dies  20 they're gonna go bring the National Guard into New York City and other places but this is enough martial law on top of senator Palmer four senators are in isolation and the rules say that in order to vote the organizers least American senator Rick Scott also too is at work contact with Lucas already have with the critical stimulus package vote expect Romney's in isolation yes let's do this aye
