 grande rising of risers at acetone ever made now we on our way Remus and know that bazooka spaces what's good you guys right now it is 2:30 3:00 in the afternoon I was vlogging late I just got through playing with my little cousin as you guys may know from the last vlog she's she's been here pretty much all week or a little over a week but that girl is just so adorable man but anyway it's gonna head to the kitchen because I have not eaten yet we're gonna try to get out here and a little bit because I need to go to the pharmacy and pick up some minutes hopefully they're open actually from the day before this 150   see this is why I work out and this is why I need to work out my arms even more because lady you got specifically struggling opening up things into disregard of my nails but still I used to be with the whole fruit loops and Lucky Charms and my ghost I'm serious I used to be all about that even pops but when I start saying then tries phosphate ingredient I was like nah that's what made me start trying no serious down I start eating healthier cereals sorry blue beans which the strawberries of no clusters the Wheaties and the raisin bran even the raisin bran I like the raisin bran French the granola in it but I see all about those series now I still though golden brown but lately they just haven't been all that easy to find maybe I should do something like that into a video about stereo I don't know give me a concept do a video about series on the workout and you guys have made already seen the road trip traveling video  one thing I'm saying right now is I have like cold and hot stuff oh it's so annoying but if you have lucky some teen space but it's obviously this bit on hold this year to be next year see how well this is coming along with just being my own couch again without half of this crap what are you doing huh what you got food you got water what do you want sir I don't know so I finished editing the vlog you guys that is ready to go now I'm getting ready to hit into a road trip Travis next video don't you just love get it things done why are you coming over the bothering me why are you trying to be on my shoe yeah do you want to be I feel about me come on come here Oh  come on yeah no I don't want you in my lap no cause I know that's what you want I know I really hope this pharmacies okay it's a little chilly but it's still pretty nice really was not trying to get outside today I don't know how did summer's gonna be you guys like whenever things start opening back up like will things really go back to normal the way they were will I was socializing really be the same I don't know I think about that sometimes I feel like for some people it's gonna be a little difficult to start back socializing like they have to take their time to give back to being to being friendly or to go on busy people or to be so close to people so I don't know let's see what happens Oh hey man that's unfortunate the crazy thing is I don't even know how we would get medications transferred to a different pharmacies like Walgreens is open but I know if I can transfer like that and I think the doctor's office is closed I'm not sure I may have to give a call Monday or Tuesday just to see what's up hey man I don't know I don't know what think about it though like I can miss that one my minutes in if I begin the transfer once again I'm not trying to wait in the Walgreens flying oh no guys get real get rid of you guys it's getting crazy so I'm looking at the updated stats right this whole coronavirus business and worldwide we are at 1 million two hundred and fifty two thousand two hundred and sixty five cases United States has three hundred and twenty nine thousand six hundred and thirty six cases within the US New York which is where I live remember that three hundred and twenty nine thousand six hundred and thirty six cases New York has 120 2031 cases yeah that's just you guys this is crazy and deaths in the u.s. is nine thousand four hundred and twenty cases deaths in New York Garrity 4159 cases you guys we as in New York are almost covering half of those cases that's crazy it's crazy I was looking at a hairline and it was just like New York it's not made to function like this like New York is meant to be busy and hustled and bustled like it's not meant for this and it's just like now they just don't even know what to say about this virus but it's understood because this is something this it's been here before as we all know if you guys you guys have seen the Lysol cans that has coronavirus on there on the older cast but in the same sense this is fairly new because we haven't had this level of impact from it as of yesterday like I literally felt it a little bit like for a short period of time I felt like dang like this really sucks down and all the reason I feel like this because a friend of mine was like I'm gonna come over and we hang out I know he's slightly paranoid about this which is right for me so don't get me wrong it's I'm not full don't get me wrong but like I had a little sip of happiness like oh that my friend about to come visit me the gang out and then later on it turned into like I don't know want to come I just like you know what it's okay stay the house and so like for really quick about five to ten seconds I feel like things but my mom would even tell you ever since I was a baby I can keep my own self entertained that has not changed as you guys have seen in my blog so I don't know guys you know just um like I'm really thankful for this time at the same time like I want as far back working like I want to start back making money but these cases men are getting crazy and they are still rising by the hours we now have rapid testing going so that's the improvement the stimulus checks has that been sent down yet I think probably from now probably about another week we're gonna have so that they would be sent out the second part of my income tax has not been sitting yet so it's like I have money but I just don't have it yet but we shall see what it brings I'll see my mom for a walk around the block I don't feel like doing that it's definitely an overcast of a day like this you guys can see yeah it's just not really the business of a sunny bright day today a lot of people are still not getting through for unemployment at least I'm hearing some people are that is just a whole wild roller coaster right there by itself when I try to upload my documents and snaps it wouldn't take that at the end of the day like I'm still okay so that's one thing I will say I still have food always by the way I do want to go and see how the line is looking for the grocery store because I do need to go grocery shopping oh my gosh you guys so I'm about to show you a clip right my first time doing a headstand in a long time try to laugh but you're not going to be able to I made this clip like some days ago and it just didn't make it to the vlog but check these

I'm actually out to get ready to leave pretty soon but you go see if I can do this sorry but thank me and my mother used to do this crazy all right so I got my pillow here right you see I think you

myself up on my hands but I'm just hoping that my back or nothing like  oh mama we made it Oh yo my salad is so off like I can feel it like I'm up but ain't no way I can do the Hank's thing I can't let hook I can't let hook I did it y'all prizes I did it alright okay my strict Oh oh my god you guys I'm trying to stretch out and I thought that I could like pull myself away from the doors and stay balanced but now oh my gosh that's not the great though it feels so great oh do you know how long it's been it's part of it about 10 years as I've been since I've done it actually probably long the neck I think I was probably my first year of high school like in the ninth grade the night brain the last time I did like hey Stan it's crazy just want to see if I can do it ever real quick but since I know that I can and we try to start back doing it more often because it actually dude it's a hand go side down for a small amount of time oh my gosh you guys finally finish editing this video we

acting role let me be the singer that's singing in the movie this is close to an acting role that I want to get but I got some acting skills though so you know don't get twisty don't get it wrong it's
