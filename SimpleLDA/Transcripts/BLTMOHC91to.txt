gorgeous outside obviously I haven't been outside but from the window it just it's so like bright and the earth just seems so happy and I want to share that with you this seems creepy but I honestly just want to share how beautiful and sunny it is out there so it is now 11:30 I'm going to do a workout I'm gonna do the Blogilates workouts I have to plan odds I think the focus is on the glutes and I've been loving actually working out I feel so much better yesterday you guys will be proud I did two workouts and I didn't feel like dying and then I did 15 minutes of a yoga like at-home workout as well and that's what I'm gonna keep doing I'm gonna do at least one I want to spend an hour doing like work out work out so like toning my body and then I'm gonna do a yoga class class oh you have a video just so I can feel better and calm my mind I used to love yoga it was like my introduction to fitness with yoga because I love stretching and like you can stretch from anywhere yeah highly highly recommend but now it's still the morning and I'm excited to prioritize my health and my body getting back into how I feel how my body moves all of that really affects your mental state and how you feel in your days I'm sure you know that but I'm just I'm giving you my TED talk okay    just got out of the shower and I'm making a smoothie it's now 1:40 I'm quite hungry please excuse this table I'm sure I've mentioned in the past video but we found this in the hallway when we first moved in and we just took it and then we just never got another table I think at this point it's now a part of part of the apartment I'm going to do raspberries my favorite fruit in the whole world one banana a bunch of spinach a little bit of cauliflower cauliflower tastes like nothing so it's perfect to like pack in a smoothie because you get the benefits without having to taste it and then this what is this called collagen it's kind of like protein powder and then some chia seeds very simple but very filling I'm gonna start off with some    it looks a little bit like swap juice or like a matcha latte very delicious we are being healthy and happy but I have some bad news you guys I have to go I have to go to the grocery store today I'm gonna go soon after I drink this I am basically out of food I have no more kale I have no greens to make a salad um I have no like beans or lentils or anything that I can use as protein or chicken or really anything I'm not that picky I just try and get my protein and anywhere that I can and I'm lucky in the sense that I do love vegetarian food and like meat alternatives um oh my god I see someone I see a human I haven't seen a stranger since like 10 days guys look at what I just did I literally emptied out all of these cupboards I'm looking for my absolute favorite comfortable sweater by a Nina ping and I cannot find it it's just it's nowhere and I don't know where it could possibly be I know it's on the laundry because I haven't worn it recently I know I didn't lose it it's somewhere in in my room but it's not anywhere that it should be it's not part of my sweaters last time I saw it it was here this crewneck was my absolute favorite and I used to have it hung with one of my jackets and now it's literally missing I'm so confused um so yeah I also made a mess that I now have to clean up you know when you get in a panic and you're

Essex market to pick up some other staff Trader Joe's was not hectic at all on the line was I had to wait for about 30 minutes but inside I think they were only letting ten people in at a time so you basically felt like you were shopping alone which was really good um not much like contact with anybody else so yeah now I understand why they're still operating I'm out of breath every time I'm out of breath I'm like do I have coronavirus but then I'm like no you just like you have a hard time breathing on a regular basis and you're like trying to get into shape so no you just carried heavy bags
