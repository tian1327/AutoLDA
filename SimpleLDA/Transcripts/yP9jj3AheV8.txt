 it's like 8 a.m. I have to drink this thing in a few minutes I'm supposed to drink - I have no idea how it tastes got like a sharp sour my job has also just officially told us that we are working from homes  like any morning I have to drink this drink before I go and do this cat scan that my doctor ordered me to do I have no idea how this tastes and how good a drink so much liquid so early in the morning but here goes I don't even know what this stuff does to your body definitely gonna have to do it detox after I can't even look good I think I was supposed to shake it and I did not shake it so that's not like you know one and I still haven't read this thing just like you have to drink all of it it does not taste like a berry smoothie sorry my hair so messed up just trying to get ready to go to work it's not good she offered me differently or she said do you want banana vanilla or berry like I don't know which one could taste better done with a weird substance in it so I says each bottle contains nine grams of barium sulfate and then a bunch of inactive ingredients I guess or the flavor I can't even really describe the taste because it's so strange definitely doesn't taste like a berry smoothie yeah I'm just gonna keep getting ready for work and drinking this right now oh so I finished it I finished drinking a radioactive smoothie and yeah I'm gonna go to work now hopefully it doesn't make me feel sick because they do feel tiny bit sick from drinking nice   and yeah I usually drink um I usually have my lemon water or apple cider vinegar in the morning but I decided to drink regular water today because I just drank all that barium smoothie deliciousness so yeah I've got my second one that I'll drink later and tiny really dark no it is 12:35 and I drank this out their bottle and yeah I gotta bring the rest with me so I'm gonna go off to my appointment now um I'm gonna start heading home after stop and get some cat food I also want to stop and get a couple of supplements because the cat scan does put a lot of it is kind of like a lot of radiation from what I was reading plus all the things that I had to do like I had to drink that barium sulfate drink I had to drink two of those bottles and then they also put an IV to put like some contrasting thing in the bloodstream so that's another thing and then the radiation so yeah so I want to do a little bit of a detox and I'm gonna stop at Whole Foods and get some supplements and I'll show you what I'm getting overall the exam was pretty quick I went and took it during my lunch break actual exam only took I think maybe like 10 minutes it just had to hold my breath a couple of times and they put me in the machine and then they put that IV and it felt weird and that was pretty much it it's pretty simple I feel fine after it the only thing I'm kind of worried about is just because I my body got bombarded with so many weird things today so that's what I'm gonna do a little bit of a detox my job has also told us that we are officially starting to work from home next week and we don't know for how long they are just doing it as a precaution they said so it's all a lot of places are having their employees work from home due to the corona virus outbreak as far as we know nobody in our office has it but there are people in this area who have it and it is spreading pretty quickly so I think that a lot of people are just a little spooked and they're just taking like extreme precautions and it's really funny because my office has been handing out little hand sanitizer packets we actually had an entire box full of these there they give them out at the trade shows some fairly branded little hand sanitizer holders with the hand sanitizer included so we had a humongous box of them and they just kept giving them out to everyone in the office so yeah I have a couple of those little hand sanitizers I'm going to take a trip now to the supermarket and pick up a couple of things and that's it this parking lot is like a company in madhouse there are so many cars I just parked as far away from everyone as I could I guess let's see how these inside Armageddon  I'm just trying to get some supplements I've got a really tired face so that's why I have my sunglasses on even though it's dark it's pretty crazy in there all of the frozen food is gone all of the canned foods are gone and everyone is just in a really panic State people are buying like six bottles of soap and five gallons of milk at a time so yeah I'm gonna start heading home I'm gonna get going picked up these supplements at Whole Foods I got chlorella tablets because that is supposed to be good for detoxing and I did read that it's good for taking radiation out and also I got this ashwagandha because it helps your body cook better with stress so when your body is like fighting off weird things that you're putting into it or that are in the environment that is stressing out your system so this is supposed to help your body cope with it a little bit better even though you may not feel stressed yourself your body could be stressed I found a really good or it looks good I found a recipe for an ashwagandha latte with almond milk that you make at night so I want to give that a try and then also reishi mushroom is really good for absorbing toxins from your body and cleaning them out so I just got this chocolate reishi drink from rubble it's made with coconut milk has vanilla and dark chocolate and tastes delicious you know these tablets you can put them into smoothies or it says you can even just eat them on their own like that I'm gonna go and change to do my workout now and then I will shower and I think I'm just gonna make it cheese and some soup for dinner I'm all ready to do my workout I kind of feel since I've been sick since last week and then I had to drink all those weird smoothies I feel like I kind of lost some of the definition in my ABS from the 28-day challenge that I did
