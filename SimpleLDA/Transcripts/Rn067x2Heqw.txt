some people think Cantu is trash I personally I like it I think it works pretty well for my hair type and I just I really don't use a lot of twisting creams but I have them just in case this bag is my holy grail of black hair care product I don't have a lot of space in my in my bathroom so I keep this in my closet lately I've been using like one of these little brushes looks like this it works pretty well I gotta say when I first saw I was like that's supposed to make it through through this head no it's not but this actually kind of works and of course I have my trusty comb it's actually getting pretty long but you guys know shrinkage is real you can see it's kind of like to my you know I don't even know why we do that leg length check you think you don't want to be straight  I just ate some ramen yeah I just a moment it's called myk's myk's good ramen and you can get it from CVS at least the ones in New York and you can get from Whole Foods really good now I got a glass of wine I've got a glass of bean okay well I'm gonna take my glass of wine I'm gonna turn this off cuz clearly I can't be wealth of the same time finish watching a few more episodes of married at first sight and I'm gonna close this vlog out morning or is it I went outside I need to take my trash out anyway so I went outside to take my trash out and I'm looking around and I'm like what is that noise and it's some idiot banging pots outside of their window at 8:45 in the morning while we're in quarantine and I'm just like why I went downstairs I'm glad I did actually because something arrived for me it loved and found I don't think I ordered anything I mean I ordered a package from she in but this ain't it  crazy nice nice oh my God look at this beautiful notebook screen cleaning toilets granola playing cards a candle I love candles oh my god this is whose job does this who would see some it was job and she's at it again look she's over there banging on a pot with a spoon what are you kidding me like I don't understand I don't understand don't understand I think I should take not this like what is happening why hey guys so it's currently Sunday and I ordered this a new week from Amazon she's real long I just cut the lace off and kind of did a little something to the part just to like try to make it look a little bit more natural um uh-oh I think I really like it it's really cute I'm gonna put some makeup on first time in like six just put on my face I got my box light out it is so bright you guys Wow yeah it looks so good I'm so proud of these lights I'll spin around so you can see them these lights were so cheap from Amazon maybe 60 bucks there's two of them I don't really even think that I need to though right cuz my apartment is small enough I feel very well lit I'm gonna set my tripod up right there and we're gonna record okay so um so I'm gathering my what exactly I want to record today I wasn't really planning to beat Matt well I have been suppose I been meaning to put makeup on for like the past couple weeks but it just hasn't happened it feels really refreshing not to have to beat my face all the time but anyway during this time I've been working of course my regular like you know bread and butter job to that I'm very that I still have because many people at this time have lost their job or lost their opportunities so I'm really fortunate to still have you know that opportunity and I still be able to work from home so really grateful for that but I have been working on my side gig in my off time since I have more time at home and that is of course blogging and instagramming so I have been reading a bunch about how to drive traffic to my blog reading about courses that I can potentially take if you guys know any good blogger courses let me know I'm looking at glows glow on a motto I think I'm saying our last name wrong I'm so sorry glow but her blog is called the blog abroad and I'm looking down here cuz I'm looking at my laptop but I being right there anyway so yeah so I'm looking at her course it's an eight-week course it seems very in-depth and I think it will help me get like direction that I need for my blog and help me get like some sort of a business model going just because I don't know how to do that I've just been trying to stay sane I have been going through a bunch I'll give you a full update once I figure out what actually is going on up so stay tuned for that later in the summer hopefully when things like calmed down a bit so I'm gonna close out this vlog right here it is Sunday evening I am so hungry I did not eat lunch so I'm gonna get some food I'm gonna probably take off my makeup soonish and then just kind of like relax and get ready for the work from home week to come so I hope you guys enjoyed this quarantine vlog I hope you guys are doing okay and I'll see you the next one bye
