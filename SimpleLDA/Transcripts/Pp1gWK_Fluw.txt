 see everything's just so short good morning everyone today I am sitting at my vanity which is makes me feel so luxurious have some but I actually got mine in my new place and I wanted to do a day in the life we are still in quarantine I'll talk a little bit more about that in a bit but I'm just a little dating life in quarantine let's get on it I'm gonna heat up some curlers I already did my skin care in the bathroom but I do need to apply some sunscreen I'm using up this hydro boost one for Neutrogena I am in the process of trying to find an ocean safe chemical sunscreen because or one that just doesn't give a white cast one that kind of sinks in a little bit more I hate the feeling of physical sunscreens and feeling is such like a big proponent of if I'm going to use it if I'm going to apply it I've always hated the feeling of sunscreen and the I actually purchased one online but I and it was delivered a couple weeks ago but I think somebody never my package until then when Seattle starts to reopen up again which I will talk about a little bit here there's a store I've been wanting to go to forever it's in the U village it's called Kate banana and it's a Korean beauty store and a couple of my friends online post about it all the time and one of my friends said that one of her favorite sunscreens was actually at Kay banana the Korean beauty or Kay beauty and like skincare has been like they've really focused a lot on new technologies and really focusing a lot on protecting this skin and not taking on a bunch of makeup so they're kind of the go-to in terms of like the most cutting-edge and modern skincare technology and formula as an ingredient so I'm really wanting to try one out and again my understanding I'm not an expert yet on sunscreens but my understanding is that the k-beauty ingredients are not reef bleaching oh god I'm not gonna be able to that's where I'm I'm finishing up I have a couple more sunscreens facial sunscreens to use up in the meantime but yeah just excited for my Korean again care to come in not even gonna mess with that that necklace so today's May seventh the governor of Washington governor Inslee extended be stay at home Horner until the end of June so for another 30 days a lot of other states are starting to open up but we've been very precautious we're gonna be doing phases like three its phases of three weeks and kind of slowly as he put it rolling back the dial or turning up the dial I'm unaware of the date three weeks from when it started slash June first I think I'm just gonna stick with June 1st is when phase 2 will begin which would be a lot more parks and outdoor recreation areas opening up as well as restaurants and salons and massage parlors and stores a lot of them opening and a lot of like restaurants and salons and stuff being at half capacity to allow for social distancing if our numbers are to kind of stay pretty low and you know plateau or decrease in the amount of cases that we have I believe all three phases would end in July even though I do believe that like social distancing practices are going to be implemented for a long time I'll be curious to see like when we actually start having like concerts or football games like really big events parades I'm personally really excited and looking forward to some things opening up although I I do not want to personally push it faster than the medical opinions believe that we should I really am trusting what our you know medical professionals are doing and believing in though I do know that this is like a really hard time for a lot of people a lot of like really unsure and a lot of people want to go to work so that they can get money which is just really sad but I I am I am looking forward to when things start to reopen because I've missed being able to kind of treat my chronic pain with some physicians like massage therapists and chiropractors and I wanted to test out like a certain type of like a new chronic pain treatment that I will probably do a video on once I do that for several weeks to see if it's worth anything so I'm really looking forward to kind of being able to like you know I do want to go talk to you like my doctor I was in the process of getting like a new doctor and trying new medicine and all this stuff and so really excited for when things open up and I'll be able to I don't know treat myself again what I should be doing and what I've been doing for years he's doing like daily stretches or daily yoga and I just find it so boring and painful and so I will also be looking forward to going to like workout classes I'm not sure what that's going to look like or entail so I put my hair up in a ponytail and I put curlers in and that's gonna be kind of loose curls as you can probably hear I feel super congested and I feel congested for the past couple days so I picked up these things and I'm really excited what's nice about having my vanity here is I feel like I can really just sit down take my time and really like massage my face with like all those trendy massage tools like and really just go in just go in and try and like promote circulation so I'm gonna do that but I also got some facial cuttings which I used yesterday and I really liked and concerned about and I like really pulling on my face and like causing wrinkles like I don't know you know to it a little oil just using up this random Beauty oil but want to get some slickness you know I'm just remembering I'm just thinking I applied oil on top of sunscreen and I think the oil is gonna like break down the sunscreen so after I do my face massage I'll put on more sunscreen oh yeah even that's just nice whoo-hoo I get a lot of like congestion in my ear it's like my coal always rests in my ear we have this little guy which I guess you're supposed to like go in here and do I don't I feel the most difference with its kind of like larger face Cup all right I think that's enough face cupping for today I do want to go ahead and do some like more massaging with some of my tools with this I'm just trying to loosen up everything and then with the Gua Sha I'll be more of a direct intentional downward type of draining motion I don't know what brand this is it might have been pixie but I do like I did at Target and it's got one of those like cooling applicator tips on it and then you squeeze and then some you know lubricant comes out this looks very phallic haha but the tip is called ha ha ha the camera was trying to censor my foolishness but yeah I don't really get puffy eyes I don't think um but it does feel good to kind of wake up and circulate the area I think I just have a lot of like stagnant like mucous and you know it's it just feels nice to like wake up the skin and like have things circulating I don't remember the guys name but there's a whole theory of vitality in life or it's like v equals P minus o which is his B's for vitality equals power minus obstruction so it's talking about how life and vibrancy and alertness and aliveness comes from however much power or flow or Chi or whatever you have - the obstruction you know it's more like a philosophy that's like a physical of mentality but talking about like if our pathways are open and clear and things can flow without any blockage or obstruction things in the way that we can be at our most vibrant so I really like looking at things like with the flow probably another reason I like water maybe apply my sunscreen alright and then for makeup I'm just going to curl my lashes put on some mascara a little bit of BB cream to get rid of the redness of my face what's the point in putting on makeup if you're not gonna put on highlighter and a little bit of lip gloss for color and shine and a little bit of bronzer to channel some summertime all right I think we're good enough to get the hair down I'm still trying to like work out this technique but that's what we're working with all right let's go downstairs and get some breakfast I have been trying to drink a gallon of water everyday so every morning I fill up this picture and you can see I've already had about one mason jar full over this go on mason jar number two and why it's pinkies I have an electrolyte powder in there just to try and hydrate me a little bit more that's why it's pink not sure how I feel about it right now I've kind of been liking it but I I need to do more research on it just in general to see how it works if it works because they can be a little bit pricey so that's why it's pink so it's getting kind of late in the day and we're getting close to lunchtime so I'm gonna have some fruit for coming rec fisty situation while I make this soup for lunch I've been craving the Olive Garden chicken gnocchi soup and so I just said it I would make it without chicken I made it last week it was and I liked it and it was really helpful I was actually really sick last week so it was nice to kind of have that warm warming hot food and have it just ready so I wanted to make a couple tweaks to the recipe this time so I found that my recipe was a little bit thin so in that close for half and half so I was curious if heavy cream I'd make it a little more of that thicker of course it's gonna be less healthier I just I just want the soup to be how I want it to taste so I'm going to make that soup right now and snack on some watermelon I picked up and cut up my first watermelon up this summer I consider me to be the start of summer not mint year but that's just me and I'm excited to get into this  all right it is now time to add the bra this time in the time before I'm gonna use chicken broth I consider myself a j't Aryan but I'm curious like do you guys consider like chicken broth like vegetarian or not like is this like when I think it vegetarianism I think it's like avoiding meat my whole thing is to do like reduce Italian so to try and like reduce animal consumption and animal products as much as possible I think in the future I will try veggie broth and I normally get veggie broth but this go-round I'm gonna try    all right let's give her a taste need salt but that's good perfect timing it's just about noon and so I am going to everything's just so short I'm too tall I'm going to sit here and have my lunch and do some computer work  oh the day she's gotten I like out ahead of me I picked up some delicious Chinese takeout from the best Chinese restaurant in all of Seattle all bamboo Gardens which is all vegetarian food and now I have a zoom meeting with some friends to paints and blah blah stuff so I need to get into some paint clothes so let's do that now got some shorts on let's go downstairs and finish setting up for some peening I have converted my kitchen into an art studio so I have a tarp since I'm working with oil paints it's gonna get everywhere this week so this will be my second at bob ross painting this week I picked up some smaller canvases because I kind of like this size more I feel like I'll be more inclined to hang them at this size I have two mineral spirits this is to clean the oils off the brush I had my cabinet open because I'm gonna put my phone here to a face time like my friends let me show you the what I did last week last week my friend gave me one of his backup or he bought a big pack of canvases so he gave me a really big boy and I'll show you the one I did last week yeah something a little like that not too shabby this week we're doing like a nighttime seascape so that's why I painted it black I need to cut out a board to make my palette alright that makes you palette it for this week from like an old like Ulta Amazon box  let's do a fantastic               hi like more like a suggestion of the shape  oh my goodness y'all I am so covered in paint I finished my painting I'm still learning the Bob Ross technique it's very difficult let me show you what I've gotten what I did there she blows the final little wave I think ultimately my paints are kinda the cheaper ones because you know it's my first endeavor and telecoil paints like this so I didn't want to like spend a crap ton of money if I didn't like it or if we weren't really gonna do this like every week so I think I need to get I got one paint that's a more expensive paint and I can totally tell a difference in its performance and thickness mainly so I think my one of my friends recommended the paint set that he uses and he's always comes out really vibrant and shape full and because I feel like I always have to like over blend mine and they don't like to lay on top of each other but me and I think that looks nice for what it is I'm gonna take a shower and then I need to actually prepare for tomorrow Washington State does have parks opened up I think it was on the - on Tuesday a couple days ago some state parks in Washington State did open up to allow for like fishing and you know recreation daytime recreation so tomorrow is going to be very sunny and clear so I and I'm going out tomorrow that will be the next video that you see maybe - so I need to prepare for that which means charging batteries emptying SD cards and maybe packing some like Road snacks and drinks so let me hop in the shower and start out with my nighttime routine     normally I'd put on a retinol but my skin seems really dry so I'm gonna give it a break tonight and use some more hydrating stuff   and we are back and we restarted the vlog at my vanity working with oil paints and those mineral spirits or whatever dry out my hands so bad so I'm gonna do some like hand cream and that's my day guys I'm gonna go to bed that way I can get all recharged and up and pump and ready for tomorrow's shoot out and some nature I'm really excited I've missed going outside thankfully I do live in a you know a pretty part of the world and I have been able to go on really pretty walks around my neighborhood but I'm excited to kind of go on a classic drive out and take some pictures out
