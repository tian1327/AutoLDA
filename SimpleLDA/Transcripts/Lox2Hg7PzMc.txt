  hi everyone welcome back to our vlog it's Wednesday today and everything was supposed to go as per usual but due to the coronavirus here in New York City it's pretty crazy and so first classes it got shifted online up until his Spring Break and my classes we are still having to go to the College as usual even the public schools are not closed yet so I have four classes on Wednesday and I did like my first two and then I don't know I just had this weird anxiety and see if it was there in my campus cuz his college is closed so he went with me he dropped me off and he was there in the library and and then I just told him can we just please leave cuz I cannot like this anxiety like no matter how much I'm like washing my hands or I'm sanitizing them are creeping keeping myself away from people it's just that anxiety that oh my god anything could happen it's a virus it's just like panic attack that just got into me and then we just came we were just on our way back come and see if I said okay let me just cut my hair because he needs a haircut now so that's what he's doing right now so we'll see what haircut he gets and we're just gonna bring you guys along to this back with his new haircut I know it's leaked it is and he is barber like always gives him like what is that the beard yeah pure cheapo didn't even care that the other person was waiting no no the other person was coming later yeah and and I was supposed to get a haircut after two damn years but coronavirus yeah the coronavirus yeah so it's in Manhattan so she wanted to go to us alone and yeah but I looked up and the reviews were really good and I really liked tell like they do it traditional at the same time they do anything stuff what you want well I wasn't willing to just got home cuz see if it needs to take a shower because he could his hair before we need to head back out again to run some more errands so I'm just gonna quickly make some coffee base that people on my Instagram seem to love so I'm just gonna go ahead and share that on this vlog so if they're on our YouTube as well in case anyone wants to check that out so I'm gonna do that in like we have like half an hour at home so it probably done in like 10-15 minutes so let's go ahead and do that so for the coffee base all you need is just some regular coffee we have the Nescafe it's like the regular coffee at home instant coffee and normal white sugar but we're gonna use brown sugar cuz my mother-in-law says that it's healthier and it is healthier so we're just gonna listen to her and do it with some brown sugar and like few sips of warm water that's it and the ratio between the sugar and the coffee should be 2 is to 1 so if you're taking one cup one whole cup of sugar you're going to take off cup of coffee that's how it usually works oh I'm going to try it go ahead and do that real quick   so I have just added a one whole cup of brown sugar and beneath that you can see there's a coffee I've added 1/2 cup of that and I've just added approximately 3 to 4 tablespoons of warm water you really need warm water I don't think it's gonna work that butt of a cold water so I'm just gonna go ahead and whisk this and the whisk at first it's gonna look like dark brown and you need to stop whisking it till it becomes like a thick like a paste consistency but the color has to be like lighter I'm gonna go ahead and do that I'm going to insert some clips of how the color should look like so you guys can be more clear on that    good news guys my classes everything got canceled even from my work as I work in a public high school so my supervisor email me that we shouldn't go to work from tomorrow because there's a high possibility that the public schools are going to get canceled as well like the classes are going to get canceled as well and so yeah that's a bit of happiness on the other hand the situation with the coronavirus it's a pandemic nights not an epidemic anymore which means it's really a mess so everyone should stay safe Oh and try to avoid gatherings like that's what everyone is saying please try to do that having said that we'll be hosting a party everyone is welcome please come over ha ha ha I'm just kidding also we went to the mall just best night to get because we ran out of printer eggs so we had to get that and oh my god usually in this hour like after office hours there are community artists but today you comin up do something called grocery shopping what are you gonna get too close what tomatoes and some tomatoes and just do what you love chocolaty much like us we love chocolate and it's and x2 yeah running out of eggs and my sister-in-law's favorite place Michaels and the arches shopping for some stuff that she needs for her project Michael's also happens to be the place where I first got the flowers in our room for so and sefa I just got safe up here this time because he wanted to choose one for this season the ones I got where from falling those are still the ones in our room he found out this really nice green one and let me quickly show you guys it's this nice teal turquoise item it's weird it is so beautiful let's see which one we get so this is the flower pot it originally when I first made it it had this flower just like instead of the Tijuana that this one and now if I wanted to put this flower and this color is so tricky so we couldn't get like anything for like the smaller ones we couldn't get like a matching color or anything that would look good together with that one so we just moved like the bigger one and changed it to this one you like it sofa so we're sitting down to work and we just made ourselves some coffee with the coffee base that I made earlier we just boiled to the milk and when it reach the boil we turn the stove off and we added like two to three spoonfuls of their coffee base risk did until the camp thought that you got device and that probably it is so good and then I just put some like droplets of instant coffee on top you like it yeah Tommy I got these balloons from a party we went to three weeks ago and these things have been hanging out here for a while so something I decided
