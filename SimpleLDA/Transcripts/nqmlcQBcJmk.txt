 hi guys happy Monday it is the ask I don't know what time it is actually let's check I just got back from Trader Joe's I loved a lot of groceries and I thought I'll start vlogging again I haven't been feeling my best so that's why I didn't vlog at all last week I tried for a couple of days I tried but then I kept stopping and I'm like okay I want to just restart today I wasn't feeling that great I just don't like like I don't like how I look I don't want to like film and whatnot but at the end of the day it does make me feel better to connect with you my videos might bring some of you some joy and that is all the encouragement and motivation that I need to pick up the camera since I just went to the grocery store and bought a lot of stuff hoping this stuff lasts me for like the rest of the month because I do not want to go outside again I do not want to wait in the Trader Joe's line again and one of the employees at this Trader Joe's I love him so much he brings me so much just happiness Wesley you're probably not watching this but I love you and it just made me it made me feel good seeing him just being able to say hi to someone in my community that brings me a lot of joy so I thought he made me happy he probably doesn't know that he made me really happy so if I can make someone happy I'm gonna do it anyway I'm gonna show you guys what I got at Trader Joe's this time starting off with the first bag I got this one of my favorite Trader Joe's offering I love it so much I got some large shrimp I've never gotten trim from Trader Joe's before I haven't had shrimp since I moved to New York honestly we got raw almond I am out of basically all my nuts I have a 12 year old boy sense of humor I got some toilet paper was on my last roll of TP toothpaste I'm out so I have to go today because I literally didn't have like my essentials got the TP we got black bean we got spinach these are for the smoothies chicken broth I got the low-sodium chicken broth I did get the white kidney beans that I love these are high in protein they're one of the higher protein beans I think 8 grams of protein so just to like switch it up cuz like I'm I need a lot of chickpeas they like like white beans I just think that's like they don't have that much flavor so when you toss them in a salad you're getting the you're getting the benefits but you don't alter the taste I find cuz like black beans tastes like something but I find kidney beans don't taste like anything maybe it's just my taste but I don't know I also got some peanut butter I still have a little bit left but I want to make cookies and I needed some more so I got the organic no salt peanut butter for those of you wondering I am serious about my peanut butter like I need it to be a certain way I got cottage cheese this is also high in protein I got toothpaste I've never tried Trader Joe's two-faced but desperate times got the toothpaste I got a bag of brown rice because I'm out of rice turkish apricots these are the healthy apricots at Trader Joe's don't get the other ones they like golden ones they taste delicious but they're not as good for you these ones that like darker the apricot the healthier it is for you so I got that because they're not adding like extra stuff to it and then I got it just from blueberries and this is nothing whoa also thank you to whoever commented about wiping down my groceries I totally agree with you oh my mom is on my case about that every day she's like if you're getting groceries make sure you wipe them down and clean them and I'm like in the sink like rubbing this grapefruit when so I'm not even kidding okay so I got more of these cherry tomatoes I still have a little bit left but if we're gonna cook or even as a snack this is just like I always get this we got two dates I think it's the Middle Eastern in me but I love dates like I just I can eat this whole thing in one sitting because I have no chill but also I have a really big sweet tooth and dates are a healthy snack I love my tea and my dates and I like to say it like an old lady at night and just do that I also got some organic spicy hummus I learned recently that this is a healthy hummus at Trader Joe's so I want to try it out this wasn't essential I didn't need this but at this point I'm just like just get whatever you want and then like don't go to the store um got some cucumbers good for salads I got this free-range chicken this is what I'm most excited about salmon I love salmon so much and these are so easy to cook I got two onions got some sweet potatoes I got my favorite seasoning in the whole world everything but the bagel seasoning I'm almost out can't run out of this stuff in a pandemic I love it the birds are chirping and I hear them I also got this body wash I told you guys I ran out of body wash so had to pick something up I'll let you know how this is I'm sure it's fine everything there is good so I trust it got some apple cider vinegar my boyfriend is forcing me to take shots of this every day so I will take his word for it and start taking shots of this every day and then the most exciting Baghdad with the flowers so um I'm just going through it and I needed something to cheer me up I typically okay what is going on outside  so as I was saying I just needed something at this moment to cheer me up I love flowers so much but in terms of like my budget and spending and whatnot I cut flowers out of my budget a long time ago I stopped buying flowers and candles and things like that it might not make sense to some of you guys that like watch my hauls but it was just something that I realized I was spending a lot of extra money on but at this moment I'm just like this is it's so small and it brings me so much joy I just let myself like buy the freakin flowers I got this I love these flowers because they last a long time and you really don't have to care for them and they're beautiful and I realized I don't actually have a base so I figure that out then I got another one of my favorite flowers hydrangeas I love this like the white creme hydrangeas they're one of my favorite flowers yeah Oh already I'm feeling so much better just from like this being in my my area I was like the highlight of my life and then I also got a blue glow I got two dark chocolates um love dark chocolate this is the one I always get it's super cheap and super good in my opinion and then I noticed that they had this one it has it's sugar-free so I'm like let's test out this chocolate I thought some pepper cuz I am basically out of pepper needed that got this everything but the a lot a lot I don't know what that is so I thought this would be good for like chicken or whatever else cuz I don't really know how to see some stuff I just like put the same thing all the time like garlic salt and pepper and lemon thought I would try this cuz I've heard great things people love this seasoning just realized I forgot to buy like corn tortillas well I guess we're not making tacos and I have a bunch of wives for no reason but we can use limes regardless I think it's eight limes like straight bond I got some brown eggs out of X so I had to pick that flat almond milk another essential for the smoothie got another grapefruit one of my favorite we got another bag of baby lemon I didn't even realize I got this I got some Kisa dough I thought I put this down because I was like I don't know um it smells good ooh garlic and herb pizza Joe so I guess I'll be making a pizza I got these Greek kalamata olives I love olives but I haven't got this much stuff in a while um it was definitely hard to carry my shoulder and my arms were gonna fall off but hey now I think I am set for like the rest of the month I really don't see me needing to get anything else but yeah that was my Trader Joe's haul I'm stoked to cook some stuff and see what I see when I come up with during this quarantine with this food but I'm mostly stoked about the chocolate and the chips because that's what my heart loves little overview I'm pretty healthy I like greens I cut the flowers there's my little fruit plate my super messy kitchen and there we have our Trader Joe's little trip I'm not entirely sure what I've decided to do but I'm cooking up some shrimp with garlic and olive oil and then I added this seasoning that I got today it smells good so so far I like it the men I'm also boiling the two beets that I got a while ago the beets are taking way too long I took it out thinking it was ready but it's still super super hard not ready at all and I'm very hungry so this is gonna be my dinner I'm just gonna eat the beets at some point tomorrow did like a kale salad with what I had so it did walnuts and tomatoes and cucumbers and then I'm gonna put olive oil and salt and pepper on it and then this is how the cooked shrimp after I cooked it again turned out yeah so I'm excited to eat it because I'm starving and I don't know what I'm gonna watch once I finish new girl because this show has been keeping me alive at this moment my fingers are black I am drying I'm gonna hopefully paint this but yeah just want to show you what I'm doing listening to my main girl Etta James one of my favorites so my fingers look like I've been in a coal mine that's what always happens whenever I draw which isn't often I'd rather changed like literally to start painting but I'm like I kind of want to just draw an actual thing and then paint it I will see you guys tomorrow and we'll see how far I get with this  good morning I'm starting off this morning by showing you my nails I'm gonna do this Marc Jacobs shade it's called Baby Jane it's like a topi gray kind of color I'm going to do a very much needed at-home manicure so we've got some fresh nails to start off the day I love this color I love like any kind of like gray taupe got my oatmeal  all right good morning it is the afternoon I was very hyper this morning it is such a beautiful day again I want to show you guys look at the Sun peeking through I'm fully aware I can go on the patio but it's like always windy and I get discouraged so I'm just gonna show you the Sun peeking through right there so nice I love at this time of the day it is currently around 2:30 I am postponing trying to work out all my motivation is gone but Shay's a new day I didn't work out yesterday I didn't do it anything yesterday I straight-up sat in the same spot all freakin day I got up once or twice as I was talking to you my camera battery got exhausted that makes two of us I'm like exhausted and I've done nothing I'm gonna try and work out today something is better than nothing I'm just reminding myself of that and I just I wanna at least work on my body during this time the motivation I got today was from the post-workout smoothie I like to drink and I don't like to drink smoothies for any other reason other than after a workout so that is what's motivating me Shay to exercise and do something so wish me luck and let's go exercise I already want to stop   my fit yeah you guys I'm very proud of myself I did two workout videos and one 30 minute of a 40 minute yoga video hopefully we get stronger during this quarantine but now it's my my favorite part of a workout it's the post-workout smoothie it wanna do a frozen banana frozen spinach raspberries collagen powder oat milk some chia seeds and some peanut powder I know it's 5 o'clock but my schedule is all off so this is technically my lunch for the day  I have a tendency to drop everything all the time so I always panic and little clothes everything right after I open it for any of you guys like that I think I've just been scarred after the many times of dropping everything  best part of any workout is hands down the post-workout smoothie I think I've definitely looks better I had to update you I love the peanut powder that I put in here it makes it taste like peanut butter smoothie I don't know I love never used a peanut powder and a smoothie that I've made before but I feel like you could totally make a like chocolate eat peanut butter kind of smoothie because I have cacao powder and then I have the peanut powder now maybe tomorrow I'll experiment and make a fun themed smoothie but this is very good have I gotten stronger no have I gotten fitter no but it's dedication that matters so we're gonna dedicate our time every day at least an hour work out every day I'm telling you this but I always change my mind so working out was the main thing I wanted to do stay very happy but that's done yeah I don't really know what else to do I'm gonna have a body shower but I'm gonna let my hair be the way that it is they're two pigeons sitting on my windowsill there's always pigeons out there you guys always but I wanted to share my flowers I woke up this morning and they look dead but right now they are blooming they're happy I love this I put them here because a I like seeing them in my room and there's a window here so it can get some sunlight and blossom the flower purchase was a good one it's definitely brought me a lot of joy and I just love having it in my space look at these cuties blossom alright guys here is my dinner I'm having two sweet potatoes to Exhale beet walnut tomato with olive oil salt and pepper salad so I'm gonna eat my dinner and there's a new episode of little fires everywhere which is the show that I've been watching I'm so excited that there's a new episode at Shea so I'm gonna eat my dinner and watch that and then gonna have my tea in my chocolate as I do every night I'm gonna call it a night for now I'm gonna edit this video and the day before yesterday's vlog and combine them and then I will hopefully see you guys all tomorrow and I hope that you're all safe and healthy and doing well and mentally strong and everything else's good I hope that that's happening for you and I'm gonna say goodbye now just wanted to pop on here and say I'm having my fourth piece of dark chocolate this is the sugar-free one that I bought the other day very good at first I was like this is weird now's good and now the texture has grown on me and I really like it and it's sugar-free we love that
