  hi everyone welcome back to my channel if you're new here this is coors life so today i'm going to be traveling on the plane i have to go back home to california for school so we're going to be flying during the pandemic time i'm going to film a little bit of the journey if you're interested keep watching  okay everyone let's get going to the airport so as you can see we're driving on the freeway in arizona it's a nice sunny day today i know i'm going to definitely miss these when i reach the bay area once we reach the airport we'll see what the situation looks like there  i just reached the phoenix international airport it's very empty when i first enter usually when i come to this airport it never looks this empty so we can see that during the pandemic time it really is impacting the flying situation let's go to the security and see how everything looks  there i just got done with the security i was very happy to see that they were following social distancing guidelines there i highly suggest that you all take those precautions yourself to make sure that you can keep yourself safe during this time i wanted to share some tips and suggestions of what i'm doing during this trip to keep myself safe i am making sure i keep a mask on at all times and making sure that it fits nicely i'm also wearing gloves to keep the extra precaution if you do not have gloves then make sure you remember to continually wash your hands for 20 seconds and also i am trying to keep social distancing guidelines throughout the whole trip making sure i'm at least six feet apart from anyone else it's time to say bye to arizona it was a really nice trip that i had i actually came to arizona on march 16th when the stay at home order started in california and now i'm leaving exactly two months after on may 16th when i have to return back to california it was a really nice trip i got to spend some time with my family and eat delicious home-cooked food and stay safe at home and now that i have to go back for school i know i'm going to be missing arizona a lot but i will definitely be coming back soon  after about two hours i reached the bay area i chose to fly into oakland airport instead of san francisco international airport in order to avoid the crowds i know that that airport is a lot busier usually now i'm on my way to the baggage claim i was happy to see that at the baggage claim it wasn't very crowded and they had different carousels running for the different cities that the bags were coming in through once i got my bags i walked over to get my uber so let's go ahead and continue on our journey this is what the shared ride place in the oakland airport looks like i was happy to see it's not too crowded like it would be if i had gone into the san francisco airport i suggest that if you are planning on taking a shared ride to make sure you carry some disinfecting wipes just to wipe around the seat that you're planning on sitting  we're on the way to san francisco now so as you can see as we're going on the freeway next to us we have the pacific ocean this is a very nice scenic drive we'll also see the bay bridge and the golden gate bridge so for this route we'll be going over the bay bridge and just next to us is the golden gate bridge so in this video you can see that the golden gate bridge is covered with fog which is the regular and normal weather here in san francisco and then as we go over the bay bridge you'll see the beautiful city coming up  one of my favorite parts of san francisco are all of the beautiful houses here they all are different colors and have a different architectural style as you can see most of these houses are over 100 years old and san francisco is known for this very unique housing style i have finally reached home it was a very long and tiring day if you can avoid traveling during the pandemic i highly suggest it  when i reached home the first thing i did was sanitize everything i suggest that if you can take hard covered luggage it's a lot easier to wipe down and then i also had a ton of mails piled up from two months of not being at home so here i'm just going through and organizing those mails throughout this whole process i have gloves on to avoid contaminating anything hi everyone thank you so much for staying till the end of the vlog i had a really long and tiring day today it is not fun traveling um in the airport during this pandemic time it really is very scary to tell you the truth um i got home maybe an hour ago and i finished wiping all of my luggage and then i had to also like shower wash my hair set all of the stuff from the luggage into the um refrigerator and all i brought some delicious curries that my mom cooked which will be very helpful since i am back in my apartment and i might not get as much time to cook now but either way i am glad that the airlines were taking precautions during this time they are implementing social distancing to an extent is they are telling the passengers to wear masks and if any of the passengers don't have masks then they even offer to give it i flew on southwest airlines i had a good experience on that we were each seated at least one seat apart from each other and then if there was enough space then they would seat it um even farther away but either way it went really well i got home without any issues but at the airport for the most part it wasn't as empty as i thought it would be and some people don't take social distancing as seriously as others so i do suggest that you yourself take whatever precautions that need to be taken um wear your mask at all times i even wore gloves because i didn't want to take a chance with that and then when i came home i removed the gloves and then i put on a brand new gloves and i wiped down everything with lysol wipes to make sure that it was sanitized and then after that i wipe down my keys and basically anything that was on the outside i hope you all are doing well and being safe during this time um we all are spacing a very similar situation if you can avoid traveling during this time i highly suggest it it's not something that you should do unless it's completely necessary which was in my situation right now and then if you do have to travel just take all of the precautions because if you take good care of it then you decrease your chances by a lot thank you so much for tuning in to this vlog i hope you enjoyed it and for anyone who is traveling during this time safe travels and just be careful don't
