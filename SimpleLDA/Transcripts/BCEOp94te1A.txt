 hello everybody my long time no see truly has been a millennium basically we're coming at you guys in much different circumstances than the last time we talked to you I don't know if you guys can tell because if you don't fall science forgive I guess you wouldn't know but we are no longer in New York we evacuated the city early March she's like March 17th I checked this morning it was March 17th mhm so we've been here for two weeks now yeah yep a little over two weeks our dad probably since early March was telling us like you should come home you should come home come back to Montana yeah and at that point just seemed ridiculous because we were like our lives are in New York why on earth hope we do that and then all of a sudden I think it was like a Thursday everything became so much more real and I remember I was babysitting and I was gonna go emcee this event and I was rushing to catch the train to go into Manhattan because I was babysitting in Brooklyn and I got on the train and suddenly it was like everything was empty and I hadn't checked my phone in ages because I was babysitting and I checked my phone and suddenly was just like all of these events were being canceled you know different health codes were coming out for restaurants in New York and I was it just became so real so fast yeah it was it was definitely like an overnight situation but only in my office decided like people should work from home and things changed so drastically in the span of like less than a week five took my mom on the phone and I was saying like the energy in the air it is so scary and then Michelle had a conversation and I both of us very quickly came to the agreement of like this is how I feel and I would and I'd like to yeah yeah I was terrifying and obviously if you guys have been following the news you have probably caught on that New York is now like the epicenter for this pandemic and it is it's gotten so bad so fast so I am personally very happy with the decision we made as like controversial as it is to travel during this time I feel like we got out early enough that it was okay we've been in complete quarantine since so it's right I have it anywhere but I've been like it's been fully over two weeks so we've fully isolated ourselves just in case we had it and didn't want to infect anyone in our hometown so yeah it's very controversial and I hope that you guys will understand and be respectful in my comments because I know that there's just a lot of feelings about like fleeing to your hometown during this time and I completely understand that and like to hear that 100% but for us like at the time especially with what knowledge we had and where we were it just made sense for us to come back here where we would be with our family have like our pets and be able to go on walks outside in nature and not come across too many people as far as lifestyle wise like who knows it might be like over two months that were here so it just makes so much sense that were in this environment for our own mental health but basically we're here at Montana now in terms of how we're feeling um I think it changes a lot I feel like half of the week I usually feel really good the other half of me cause I'm not like I should get so scared about what's going on and you know having also being people who live in New York and I guess get really emotional sometimes about just feeling like very powerless I'm not knowing how to help and not only that but also just like in turn from a selfish standpoint looking at your own life and being like what the I can't plan anything I can't plan how what to do which at the end out it isn't like a huge struggle but we're like talking about our own personal experiences we obviously feel so lucky to be quarantining and probably like the best situation that we could possibly be in we're safe we're healthy we're with our family we're like able to go outside we're able to breathe fresh air and Montana has very few cases and it's like really taking a lot of precautions very quickly I personally have been going on a rollercoaster ride similar to you brings up a lot of like existential dread and feelings of like what's the point of anything yeah and when will things go back to like quote-unquote normal I was already feeling like in my regular day today me in New York like I couldn't like I always felt like I wasn't doing enough and like I feel like oh yeah and like learning how to do stuff and now I feel like wow I mean sorry everybody can't do a whole lot yeah it's a lot of uncertainty and it's so scary and sometimes I feel very like claustrophobic and like panicked and extremely bored we have not moved back here permanently some people were confused or confused some things that we moved here again and that'll be shocking cuz like when did y'all think we back ya know we a hundred percent like still New York residents were just here until things get better in New York which at this point I think probably will be like a month or two fingers crossed yeah we're just trying to take it one day at a time I just don't want to say I hope you guys are doing okay and then you guys are staying safe and also like yeah and staying sane and finding mental well-being basically we want to be a source of joy if it can even just be like a tiny little bit of like distraction from this insanity I feel like the tone of this clip has been very like this is hard this is Jerry but like going forward hey hey also thank you for dealing with the kind of expired content that we've been both in the last two videos were old so going forward only fresh new content for you hopefully we just want to create content that is a source of comfort and a source of distraction and moments where you need it and we're gonna try to be uploading two times a week I'm going forward God knows I had the time so thank you for all of you who sent us love and support when we first came forward about like how we were in Montana now and all the people who reached out and said that we did the right thing or they supported us that was so powerful and meant so much because we were truly really anxious and self-conscious about sharing that so without further ado a couple days of work from home vlogs for you guys just showing you guys are like David day and there will be more much more to come new stuff not old month old continent yeah so love you guys Justin Bieber heart please stay safe and be kind to each other and hopefully in this time where we aren't able to interact with other people we can create a little community of support online and yeah we'll see you very very soon  good morning it's currently five o'clock Montana time and I am filing for unemployment I'm up this early because I have a theory I'm gonna trying to file for unemployment for weeks on the New York unemployment site that keeps crashing because of the millions of people that are ugly filing for unemployment and probably I mean indefinitely so I went theory that I need to get on earlier so I'm up at five because that's seven so in New York time let's try it a unless you guys got like almost done with it yesterday and in a crash when I got pretty far in hello I was little Braves and that's how you know I'm in Montana because I can't braid my hair for but my mom can't so that's why I have those if I don't get this I won't be able to pay for my apartment in New York but oh my god this is so complicated well will I receive vacation pay no are you getting vacation pay oh then we have two genders on the know you have an employment side which i think is very me how many times are you a citizen of the United States no what is your feeling or discretion number I happen here the thing that really got me last time which is the corporate office corporate officer questionnaire I don't know why I'm getting it I'm certainly not a corporate officer when will the business operations resumed you know good question state of New York I'm not sure I'm restaurant sorry outfit same bed to the payroll I'll buy where oh my god on throat talk to you guys soon I'm pumped hi guys okay so obviously I did manage to go back to sleep because it is lighter now and I look a little less disheveled which is a pro I think I only got probably like about an hour it took me a while so I made myself some coffee and it is currently 820 and it's headed to the dining room to start editing the New York video I'm not the final final stages but certainly the last few days here of editing which is nice as I've been working on it just before forever so I'm excited to do that in my family home right now obviously very weird should be here for this long honestly um it does feel as if broad just living together again we are but it does feel like a blast from the past it's weird but it is very nice also very soothing to be in this environment at this time when there's so much up in the air there's so much uncertainty at least I get to be in this like nice house with multiple rooms you know like that is such a blessing hello okay I'm gonna sit down now and get some editing done right next to Thomas is cat food and this tiny cup of jelly beans so things are a little cleanup okay so it is now 11 o'clock I've been editing for a few hours now got some stuff done first of all I cut the video definitely 35 minutes to 32 minutes which is exciting it shows over here doing something what you're doing I'm making oatmeal nice my schedule is over here which I did share on Instagram I made it yesterday cuz uh me my mom went on a run did she was just like II need structure and I was like listen I know I made it from a template on canva and then I just kind of fiddled with the color scheme and a little graphics as well as a little extra to dues portion because I wanted to make sure that I was writing down the stuff that I liked the miscellaneous stuff I wanted to get done this week it's kind of helped me so far figure out and analyze like how best do I stay productive not had a toxic way just in others trust me guys literally you don't have to worry about me straining myself I think a lot of people are just like that's toxic hustle culture not like I need a little hustle vulture I don't hustle anything sometimes I haven't hustled anything for the past few weeks so basically I'm trying to get out of bed and be up and running by 8:00 I want to try to make most days editing days at least Monday Tuesday Wednesday we michelle have established that we want to try to make Wednesday my uploading day and Sunday hers so that's sweet and then an exercise who hasn't been trying to stay active so yesterday I did run two miles so that's why that's on here and today I'm going on a three-mile hike I'm trying to alternate between running and hiking just because I don't want to hurt myself because I haven't run regularly in a long time also here we can recall throw it back to when everything was normal and we lived in New York City I injured my back I had a Bulge disc I am never tired of talking about this I could talk about this for the rest of my life because I crave attention but uh I did get a board to disc in my back and it really was ouch and it like messed up some nerves so sometimes my like my arms would go numb well my legs would go down anyway it mostly repaired but I think something about like the stress and then the sudden movement when I hadn't been moving made my back kind of like spaz up again a couple of uh I don't know a couple of weeks ago feeling much better now after taking it easy so I'm trying to move all the time we're so lucky that right now are in a position in this quarantine where we can go out and be in nature and not be around people because that that right there is the ultimate pro of Montana hi oh my god parents parents first appearance in a blog in a minute and this quarantine you guys went to Costco okay I think I'm gonna help them put away some groceries and then I'm gonna head out on my hike cardio is hey guys so I am here I've changed into some leggings and a turtleneck and I'm gonna head up the mountain through my exercise I am like a full hour behind on my schedule but you know rules are there to break so yeah come along with me let's head up the mountain it's exciting   hi so this is like the highest up I've been in a while for sure and it feels really good I feel like I've already regained some of my lung capacity back in the last few weeks so that's really great it feels really good Luna start looking for Gophers you look like a damn fool she's got mud mouth now cuz she's sticking her head and go for holes but yeah let's head home gosh that stout she's not quite as good at it as Nonna I don't know if you get the energy from her but she's not practically a mountain dog okay so I am back from my walk and good thing too we made it just in time because it just started snowing so you know that's something to be excited about so I'm kind of looking back and I'm a little cold so I'm going to just pop upstairs brings off my body real quick and then come back and make some brunch okay push our time now and I put on a little bit of makeup so that I don't you know look like a troll all day and I'm going to make myself some brunch now okay so update time on the meal so I had some leftover pesto from the back of the fridge it was delicious I ate that standing up and it was great now I have my part to snack which is carrot sticks in hummus and a cheeky magic bar because that's what we call balance in this house and now I'm gonna go it on to my noon activity and my noon activity today is just more editing so I'm gonna heat up my rice heating pad which I had from the time that I got my IUD in rock on and I'm going to go and sit in the reclining chair in the family room and do which honestly is so comfortable and it's where I would like to die I'm just kidding but it is very very soothing and so much better than being like this I don't know how Michelle stays sitting here all day what's the secret what's my secret how do you not get tired how's your back out hurt it does know I am an idiotic man delivering a village pamphlet you imagine in this weather and at this time of night I like New York in January when harsh city lines blur and the guests of 42nd Street drift back to picket fences while the rest of us tired but hopeful in the New Year haze right home and emptier train cars I like New York in January went on the occasional Sunday snow might keep French goers from their Eggs Benedict a frosted Chrysler will smile slightly peeking through the midst of the harbors edge isn't this better anyway I like New York in January I like it like I like you tell me again how you love lights will take to rooftops as I rush to buy you five dollar flowers at the street corner they are still open after all even in this January all right we are here in the kitchen ready for dinner time oh gosh I did really smear my makeup when I rubbed my eyes all those times mom what do we got here we have vegetarian chili YUM it looks delicious it's roomy no yours is

it was see you in three it's like the saddest season of Downton Abbey and it's just if you don't watch the show I don't know spoiler alert but we all know season 3 episode 5 it's a roller coaster solving just straight-up sob now watching a new video from Lucas while Tonks is over here doing some important work that work is grooming I'm gonna head to bed soon it's gonna be 11 I need to have an early start because I'm gonna get that New York video up tomorrow so much work to be done tomorrow I can't wait to make more content that can potentially soothe some of you out there right now love you lots bye hello everyone good morning coming at you bright and early so for my everyday work from home 14 I typically wake up around 7:00 7:15 because I have calls every morning at 7:30 why is this you may ask because New York time that's 9:30 so my team the digital team at Davin s North America we all get on a video call everyday 9:30 New York time which means that I have to be up a pretty bright and early but honestly 7:00 7:15 it's not that bad I'm not gonna lie to you guys I typically just don't wear any makeup don't really get ready for these calls I do try to like throw on another layer on top of my pajamas so I threw on this sweater so that I at least look presentable I thought about filming a more idealized routine where I like wake up at like 6:30 to like get ready and make breakfast before my call but I just don't do that like I wake up at 7:00 7:15 roll out of bed throw on a sweater run down stairs get on the call and I'm pretty close with my coworkers so it's not a huge deal to just like look like this do a no makeup look wear my glasses and so that's been my typical routine so I'm gonna walk you through what a day looks like well I'm working from home I probably do more of these videos as we move through quarantine and as I start developing more structure but right now this is what I do and this is what I've been doing and I feel so blessed to be really busy at work and have a job and I know so many people are not in the same position and I truly feel for all of you who are going through Java struggles right now I just can't even imagine but yeah I feel super super lucky to be working right now and to be like keeping busy and yeah I'm able to do so completely remotely from Montana it's not a problem so in case you were wondering but yeah I'm gonna head downstairs for the call and get my day started huge' narak tumblr quote but first coffee because it's very needed it's I'm in the morning so let's do it very excited that my parents currently have the Khalif iya farms Oh Matt because this is my favorite oat milk it's the best one just is yes sound good hi alright y'all so it's after my call and I just changed into comfy clothes I'm trying to make the effort to change at least into a different set of loungewear um sometime in the morning or midday I'm not really putting too much pressure on it like I definitely don't follow the like rules if you're supposed to for working from home but I do want to start changing in to a different set of comfy clothes at some point simply because my pajamas have been getting dirty too quickly but yeah I threw on this sweater which is from Boehm and I got it when I was in Montana for Christmas and then I have these comfortable joggers from Athleta we're gonna do a quick little hair tutorial davin s hair refresher dry shampoo rub that in the roots cuz I was a little oily I'm going to use Devin s dry texturizer to hopefully make my hair look less like a blob and more like we play up the natural wave trying to use less heat on my hair and so this is what my hair looks like when it's like been air-dried and I slept in a bun so honestly not that bad not too shabby yeah this is our final look okay everyone so I have been working for our like I think an hour since I checked in with you and now time for breakfast made by my mother this morning I do have to say sometimes I make it myself today is not that morning out some oatmeal with banana right here very excited to tuck into this and I take this to my desk and eat while doing some more work because that is what life is these days so where is my workspace you may ask um I currently am working from the dining-room table it's very nice to have a workplace of my own so yeah usually my hours are 7:30 to 3:30 however I do tend to work past that nowadays because our digital team is slammed we've got so much content to make we have to scrap a whole month of content and start from scratch and completely change our messaging around like a whole coronavirus issue so it's been a lot of hard work I've been creating a lot of videos having people send me a lot of clips and like edit I've been doing some illustration work it's been a lot of fun work but definitely a lot of hard work too so yeah right now I'm just working on a little video it's a little like salon makeover and yeah I'm hoping to get this done in a couple hours and then we do have a company-wide call to discuss moving forward within the company and that how things are doing because obviously a lot is up in the air right now so yeah that's what what today is looking like okay everyone it is lunch time I just had my call with the rest of the team and honestly it did like stress me out a little bit so feeling a little anxious and not super great but we're gonna push through regardless me myself some leftovers so we've got this like poppy seed dressing delicious kale salad thing from Costco with brown rice and chicken and I'm gonna finish up working hopefully I can just like bring out these last you think they have to do and then it's the weekend  hello everyone so it's after work hours I'm very excited about it it's around 4:30 now so I ended up working a little bit extra however it's okay because I got all my stuff done anyway we're about to go on a run now and I'm talking about myself and my sister who is changing in the other room so what did I accomplish today today I mainly worked on finishing educational webinar video and finishing a hair makeover in salon video that thanks for that we filmed around a month ago so I was mainly finishing those we also had a couple calls and I also just scheduled content for the weekend so I know some of you are interested in what I actually do in my day to day so I'm trying to like infuse that into the vlogs so I know today wasn't super glamorous but life isn't always glamorous yeah I thought about like making it a very curated day and it just didn't happen and I figured you know it's a good contrast I'll be in schedule was more fun mine is more like mine is also straight land you have the comfort and stability of a job right now who knows like things could change like if this keeps going and we're not able to like ship product anymore like who knows companies are for a little English and right like nothing is set in stone so very stressful time for everybody but right now I feel very hashtag blessed indeed dude how much do you think you're gonna run like a couple miles I would like to run three three miles it's gonna be rough exercise I think is really
