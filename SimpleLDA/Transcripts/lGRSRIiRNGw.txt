 Grande rising arises   it's acetone ever Megan now we on our way to Vegas you guys we are in the middle of a crisis of chaos of an invisible war that is everything that you have been hearing on TV on the news on the radio on your Facebook feed or you know I mean it's everywhere obviously that's thought talking about the coronavirus is a crazy crazy situation right now and it's a situation where it's really putting people in survival mode don't judge me because I know I have like a smirk on my face but it's just because when you see the actions of certain people like where they are within a certain event that's going going it's just like wow really really Wow I don't know obviously everybody is sort of kind of going through a not really a in shelter order but a self quarantine which is definitely voluntary honestly I feel like that's the best option to curve the heights of this coronavirus print I wanna say a lot of people but you know definitely a good handful of people is not really taking this serious such as people in Florida they still it's beating you know a couple of days ago people weren't out in the clubs and at the bar it's just white boy man like I can't make a video with you I can't do nothing with you say hi you're being rude to the horizon look they're up here how come I can't do anything with you meowing hmm that's funny that's for me you came home cat got your tongue all right now put you down and I'm going to continue this video who knows you tried to bite oh my god anyways forgot what I was saying but welcome to the first vlog oh I guess I'm going to try to do daily vlog pretty much of this self-quarantine theme because as you guys know a lot of people are out of work right now business have been closing down hotels cruises bars restaurants certain offices you know I mean just so many jobs so I'm just out right now and I am one of them because as you guys know if you've been on my channel for definitely a month you will know that I work at a restaurant and so we are closed I X the owner are we closed for you know like this two-week period the 14 15 days they were talking about or are we closing to a further notice and he gave me what they takes back until further notice and I was like okay you're checking with that being said I decided to give you guys a in look of pretty much what I'm gonna be doing day by day and I think that's pretty interesting because it's like oh my gosh gotta get rid of all these boring videos because I'm only gonna be inside I'm all gonna be going outside for like the necessary things actually pretty soon have to go down to the bank and get my rent I mean what's exciting about that you're not done that do my thing I do my thing with the vlog all you gotta do is subscribe and watch so that's what this is day one over a period of time there is so much literally that I have to do believe it or not and honestly I would love to know what you guys are doing during this step quarantine hustling for work are you enjoying the time around the house are you enjoying time with your kids teaching are you learning something new certain things that you probably haven't done months and be like you know I was just so busy I couldn't really do it you know so good time to do it and I must open this window or should I say open these videos for you guys so you can just see what I do from day to day because because honestly I'm pretty interested to what I'm gonna be doing from day to day but I know I have a lot of things to do I don't know about you guys I definitely have a lot of cleaning to do I need to clean and straighten up my room I actually had it straightening up at one point I don't know what really happened I mean I dunno what happened but wow I don't know I don't know exactly how this is gonna go so hopefully you can stay on this journey with me and just work with me a little bit with this I mean this is the first time this has happened this is gonna be something guys this is gonna be something another great thing is I will be having different content videos for you guys because I will be able to shoot more and upload more of other videos because I'm not working who is talking to you I don't care as far as my ideas and views about what I think about this whole pandemic I do really really think that if we stay in for you know 2 or 3 weeks or whatever that will we'll be able to lower the curve on this crisis I mean I hope you guys don't see anything really like ya probably need to second-guess this girl's mental health but no no no no I don't think that's gonna happen it's not gonna happen by the way if you guys are not on my Instagram you need to get on it I don't know what it is lately but it just seems like I have been catching the most interesting events when I'm on the train or like when I'm walking let's get it to this day one you're gonna get ready to head down to the bank and get the rent also talk to my cousin which is my landlord about being out of work and so if we could just cut this rent for a couple of weeks you weeps - no till we all get back to working you know I don't know how that's going to go but let's go as you can see I'm not covered I don't have on a mask I don't have on gloves I have one glove so whenever I touch this ATM machine I'm good just because I don't want to mess blows doesn't
