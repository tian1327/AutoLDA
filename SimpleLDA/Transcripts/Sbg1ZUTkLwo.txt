 hello everyone well back to the vlog this is kind of my first vlog since this whole new routine has come above and I will say I do want this vlog to focus on things that are gonna take your mind off things I'm really gonna try not to mention the coronavirus after this intro I would say though I do want to reiterate if you can stay inside stay home stay busy at home and looking for things to do I have a whole blog post I wrote down lots of tips I have a working from home video I have an at-home workout video I'll link them all down below but if you can please stay home we need to as a hashtag that's obviously trending flatten the curve the more of us that stay home and stuff isolate those of us who can it will truly make a difference so I want to just get that out there first just to remind you but the rest of blog calls were gonna just keep it light-hearted and as normal as I can so it's a Friday in New York I'm gonna vlog today and tomorrow I actually have a really funny idea well I know what's very funny but I think it'll be like kind of like Herto free later so mean Kevin ken has been like baking like a crazy person it's like her new thing she's taking off since we have to start doing this so what we're gonna do is we're both boss like in our separate apartments obviously are gonna Bowl to make a banana bread and then tomorrow morning we're gonna make David and Tommy taste them and decide which is the best but like not knowing who baked which one so kind of like a bake-off you know when they do that you own the Great British Bake Off when they do the technical test it's kind of like that in a way so the other side who made the better banana bread so this is what we're doing to occupy ourselves on a Friday night and Saturday morning but it should be fun and if anything we'll get loads of banana bread it's like one of my favorite things as a tree so that's the plan for later but first I'm gonna do a little bit of work I have my little home office set up then I probably usually at lunchtime I try and get out like for a quick 10-minute walk I would say our neighborhood has been so good like it's so quiet around like even when I look down the street now I usually can see like four or five people oh my god a sunny treat I see three people so in fairness everyone's being so good unlike listening to the professionals and you know it is important to get a little bit of fresh air if you can so we have been trying I usually go out like lunchtime for ten minutes and then I try and go for like a half an hour in the evening because I'm still trying to do you like my 10,000 steps and just keep us active as possible so I'll bring you maybe outside when I go for my walk and like show you how quiet it is and hopefully that will also inspire you to stay inside as much as you can and then later on we'll yeah we'll do something fun but before I start do some work I actually wanna show you the makeup I've been using a few people have been asking me on my Instagram I hate when people say that that's asking me on my Instagram but I promise you I actually did get a few questions and I kind of want to share this anyway it is the foundation I've been using I really like it so obviously we're just staying at home and I just feel better when I feel good about myself so I've just been popping on a little bit of makeup every morning like as you can see nothing much just my foundation concealer mascara a bit eyeshadow lips and a bit of blusher like nothing crazy but this is the foundation I've been using and it's a great at home foundation it's like it's a CC cream so it's much lighter you only need like the tiniest obviously blend it in and it just gives really nice coverage like I have a little bit of a breakout going on I think it's time to stress and the worry if I'm being very honest but it's there so I'm kind of like not trying to cover it up fully obviously but in fairness it does a great job this foundation so I wear the shade likes when I have no turn on like today when I put on time tomorrow on myself feel good and then when I've tagged on I used the medium tan shade one thing about it is though I wish they would make the packaging a bit better like look it's all coming off and I've only had this I'd say a week or two so yeah that's the only bad thing whatever hangouts I absolutely love this foundation so just in case you're playing around with makeup or like experimenting or doing tutorials and stuff I figured that was a good one to share it I'm gonna get comfy right here and make a coffee I've already had my breakfast and everything this morning and I did actually share my usual morning routine in the workout video that I did so my breakfast that I have and my vitamins and everything so I'll link that down below if you want to see it so gonna make that sit down on my little desk and then I'll check in with you once I get like an hour to work  okay few hours later and I'm well and truly need a stretch I my room my room - Thomas whenever I'm starting to feel like sluggish and tired like just another kind of typical working from home but it's new to you as soon as you start feeling sluggish like you're not gonna be productive so just get off move even if it's just like walking on your prime mover like two minutes it actually makes a difference just like trying to get like a hundred steps in or something like that but anyway I'm gonna put on my jacket now I'll put on some runners and just get out for a little bit of fresh air okay story of my life I am the person that forgets to put my keys back up here every time these are like spare keys for Ken and Davis and stuff so now I have to go through all of my cold pockets and see where I put them it's wrong with me I will never learn eventually I got them they were in my workout bag bag I keep my boxing gloves in okay need to get better at putting these back  okay so this is mine of the neighborhood it's so beautiful it's called South Street Seaport it's like pretty close to where you live so we come down here a lot as you can see people there dogs it's so pretty koi to be fair I think people are doing a good job staying in and their kids off I think like the majority of restaurants as well as love this is close this one here is closed I think this one could be doing like delivery some of them are still doing delivery where you can go and like pick off and you know it's so hard for businesses right now so hopefully people are supporting I think we are gonna get delivery from somewhere local tonight just to support one of them and because it's it's Friday we've been cooking all week but yeah no spaces air tools very quiet down here even if it's only for a few minutes it's actually so nice to get some fresh air and we also live really near pier 17 and that's where we've kind of been going every evening for a walk there's like a walkway all along Walter you can kind of walk up to the edge and you can see the Brooklyn Bridge it's actually so nice and we're really looking to have that and we're like able to live close to there I just there's something about the Walter I don't know it just feels very refreshing so that would be our walk later so there's so much tell you that but I try and calm like to this area for my kind of midday quick 10-minute walk Second Sight it is so nice and so warm and perfect spring weather outside today which is so typical but he's like it out for a bit and I'll try and get out again later but back ain't gonna make some very quick and easy launch I'm gonna do a wrap just something really quick and easy we actually are kind of running out of our food a little bit which you think it wouldn't be that worried about but now kind of but not really like our local supermarket it seems to have a lot and we might try and go to Trader Joe's tomorrow I think Helen David went there today and they said it wasn't that bad so yeah Michael here tomorrow so it's gonna be kind of a kind of a random wrath I'm gonna make but this what we have left okay so these air and the ingredients obviously we have the wrap I like these ones from Fair jewels pen meet handmade whole wheat flour then I have been really into this actually turkey breast and you know I'm not a big meat-eater I'm like more or less vegetarian but I have been liking this and I looked it up on last like videos and stuff and people say that it is actually quite good I always look up those videos like best things to get from Trader Joe's like the healthiest things and this I saw in one of those videos so I gave it a go one week and I actually read like it's all do one slice of that then I will do half an avocado this is just when I had the other half of yesterday and I'll pop in a little bit of this cheese which is um and mozzarella style shreds it's a cheese alternative so yeah nothing too crazy today but hopefully would have more of like a exciting dinner this evening so this will do me for now also what I think about it a lot of you were actually asking how work is and how like anything has changed is it so busy and it's still very early days I will say for me obviously like I work for myself I have my own business so this time this kind of time is very worrying for me for sure and I know so many people are struggling and they're losing their jobs and I thought see heartbreaking and when I suppose for me I'm kind of used to always like fighting for work like when you do work for yourself especially in this industry it's a lot of proactive pitching and reaching out and getting in touch with brands and stuff so I think I'm I'll be able to get through it I gotta just keep going and keep working even harder definitely some of the brands I was supposed to be working with over the next few weeks they've postponed which is totally understandable I get it and some of them have been really nice though and they've like let me invoice in advance so like some of the bigger corporations though I'd work with they've like a lot of me to invoice so they're still gonna pay me it's kind of like almost buying a voucher I suppose for my business which is so nice and then of course some smaller businesses they aren't able to do that which is totally understandable and even some of the ones life works with I've told them do not worry about paying me like for work that we've done and like take your time because some of them have to close boutiques and you know let go of staff and it's so hard so I've also tried to be doing my best on that end as well so yeah it's kind of a weird time I would say though I'm still getting work at the moment which thankfully it's so great and a lot of my long-term partners as well or keeping going with me which is so amazing and I really want to just like help them as much as I possibly can over the next couple of weeks or months or however long this takes so if you do see sponsored content here in my channel throughout my youtube or on my Instagram hopefully to be able to support understand that like I also have to keep working and I also want to help these brands much like on and yeah we're kind of all this we're kind of all in this together at the end of the day and I think we all just need to really pull out the stops and do what we can do and obviously I do super-sensitive attending sponsored stuff I'm doing I'm not going to be like you know promoting silly unnecessary things at the moment it's like I'm really gonna thing through and I've even talked some of my long-term partners and we've kind of readjusted like the type of products we're gonna promote or like the type of outfits or just we've really thought about the content so know that when you see something sponsored over the next while like I've really taught it true and I'm not just like throwing something out just to make money but yeah that's the update and if any of you need any help or advice or just tips if you're also running your own business or if you just Navy lost your job like feel free to always reach out to me you can email me DM a an Instagram comment below whatever it is and I will try and help you as best I can so that's just a quick update just so you kind of know we're definitely all all feeling it but thankfully like even today two new jobs came in which honestly I was kind of shocked I know she was like oh my god is this happening cuz one minute there's someone postponing and then someone is signing on so at least that's still happening who knows like this time next week there might be like no new jobs or there might be loads of new jobs who knows we had our fingers crossed I think we want you just stay positive and like put the good vibes out there we'll all get through it so yeah quick little updates now I have to go back to work and stop procrastination hey guys Tommy is back work is done for the day that's kind of all I can concert on today but just before we get ready for the banana bread situation I just actually read a comment saying that people still it was actually from a nurse and she was like I'm working off as I saw her at the moment and the evening it's so nice to see just an escape and your videos and that she really misses like my Calm shopping with me videos so I have one thing I want to show you so I just got this delivery in kind of before everything went a little bit crazy it's actually for collaboration not these but they're from Urban Outfitters I'm working with them on like a denim campaign but they let me choose some extra pieces and I won't be doing any come shopping with me for a good while I'm guessing so this is kind of like a mini one and anyone who kind of is looking for a bit of a fashion escape obviously everyone is in different boats right now and I am in no way pressuring anyone to like be shopping or whatever but if you are and I know some of you area because you're kind of writing to me and telling me that you're still trying to you know get on top of your spring shopping or get a few bits then this is for you so these are some things and the first one is discarded again and this actually isn't a color that I would usually go fer but I had this already in like the cream color I wore to the event I went to with them for the collaboration I loved it so much and then I saw this collar and I just was really drawn to it it's so beautiful the material is really soft so I'll definitely be getting lots of wear out of that now like at home for the next few weeks and then second thing I have beginning lots of wear out of wet shirt I love this color and I actually have a sweatshirt like this but it's honestly gone so old and so raggedy because I wear it all the time so I needed to kind of get like a replacement and this one seems really nice so love that then I ordered these denim shorts in the hope that I would get to wear them soon fingers crossed I actually didn't have a pair I had a Levi's pair like last summer but say kind of stretched out on me so I ended up donating them and then I want to like get a new pair and these looked really cool so I'll try these on now over the next few days and I'll let you know how they are but they look really nice so far and then for like the campaign's we're shooting I ordered just some accessories from their size I really liked this simple necklace it's kind of like a two-piece it looks really cute and I got these Sony's they're very like untrained at the moment this style I ordered this bag I love these like little mini bags right now shoulder bags and they're really handy actually and I didn't have a black one and I liked that it was like this croc and it's gotta go noise to the output that I'll be styling and then last but not least I got these shoes I've loved them I'm not like the biggest biggest snakeskin person but I love this style and I like that this is kind of like a subtle like you won't even see this part and the straps are quite subtle so that's like a little haul for you and hopefully a little bit of escapism just showing you a few pieces I've added my wardrobe I had actually got some other new bits and pieces in as well before all this craziness happened and so maybe next week for like my Wednesday video I might do a little kind of my Jenelle Tryon or just like outfit ideas with some new bits I have and also some bits that are in my wardrobe so that even when you are working home or you are at home you can still get dressed I'm gonna try every day like today is pretty casual because it's Friday and I'm a little bit tired as you can probably see but next week I'm going to really know everyday get dressed get off maybe shoot some photos of myself in front of here that's gonna be the situation for a while but yeah it's nice to keep feeling good about ourselves and keeping positive okay guys we got the goats so we have bananas chocolate chips flour baking soda and extract this is castor sugar it's called superfine sugar over here I think that's what they seven like Google's anyway and then I have the butter and the eggs so let's get to it I change into my baking clothes well the names over I just showed you we have everything set up Tommy's gonna help fill up even though I'm not gonna be able to show him like the end result but I don't think it's actually to make a difference anyway because we'll just give them like a slice of each so it's gonna be very hard to know anyway which is which and they'll taste the two slices so he's gonna help for them I have average hopes about this I've done this once before and I was like okay but I'm gonna follow don't ask Ian he's Irish and he has a YouTube channel like he's a Cooking Channel and I watched his recipe and it looks really nice and I'd have all the ingredients for that so I'm gonna follow his recipe also I look so Shalini oh my god I'm gonna follow his recipe cross my fingers and I'll try and like show you some snippets and I told Kaylin to like take some like just camera take some like camera take some camera clips of her baking as well so if she did I'll pop them in here too so you can see the two stations cousin was looking at a YouTube video I'm gonna okay oh it's my banana Bradfield let's see if I can actually do this bread so I'm going to show you how to make stop filling this bird Oh God no such file that we're using a class class thing because it's the only thing I have in this apartment that helps measure okay it's okay well they feed it up after  okay so they say the riper the bananas the better so we have very organized okay guys we're ready this is what it looks like evens it out now I'm gonna pop it in the side for an hour the last time I did this I had it on the wrong setting so I made sure to fix that this time and we have an hour so there's 641 so I'll check it out in like like half seven hey everyone Caden here erica has asked me to film a little bit of me making my banana brain so I'm just about to get started I said all my ingredients lined up here as you can see um and I am using a recipe from Dolan's Higgins website a few people on interim actually recommend it to me and I tried it during the week and turned out pretty well so I'm gonna go buy that again tonight I have altered it slightly but mainly just going by that recipe and hopefully it'll turn out good I'm just gonna get started now so I'm trying to fill up some bits and bobs of me making it and yeah fingers crossed earlier because I will look at Erica to link the recipe in the description box was just a quick overview of what I'm using so we have flour here at the back I got gluten-free because it was only one left but I'm thinking you can use any one then we have some butter some vanilla extract baking powder brown sugar chocolate chips it says honey in the recipe and I only have golden syrup so hopefully that will work the same then we have some coconut oil and another thing I'm adding in actually that's not in the recipe is walnuts I think that'll make it nice and then I also have eggs here and obviously some bananas so this is for bananas already washed off and these were ripe as well it says to use ripe ones if possible so yeah that's everything and I'll try and fill them now little snippets of me mixing everything together and hopefully making a very nice banana bread  let's talk it out it looks good oh it looks great Bush not bad so I'm not gonna show what you got I'm gonna wait til tomorrow and yeah that's that dawn place not very nice so I'm gonna go out now we're gonna get a quick walk and I'm going on like 5,000 steps today so we're gonna go for a walk along the pier and then we also ordered pizza from like our local pizza place because it's Friday and these days you need some sort of a treat to like separate the weak from the weekend so we ordered one big pizza and we're gonna get about the wine and chill here for the night so now that's something else don't know so tell me how are you surviving and challenging oh god we have like a week Tom what we've done the things I said open when we've been down towards the pier cute little Mexican place in the summer looks like they're open I guess for take-out and then the place we're gonna get pizza is just down here well it's nice to get out we were just saying though the air actually feels so much cleaner I don't know if we're just imagining it but I suppose there's like less traffic and that one there's hurt okay so turn on now and show you the pier actually very pretty at night so this is our nicely walk she just loved her Tommy we've never ever walked around here so much but it's actually been so nice we're just trying to stay positive I call quite others I was a few people over there they're together it shouldn't be together I hope not to you again opener coolest it is close oh these three to closing off the walkway down here I think at a certain time every day when I start calling earlier it's so pretty they're lighting it up in the American colors kind of like a solidarity thing I think the Freedom Tower or like another building is the same yeah closed during the day I think you can still walk down but there must be some reason for closing at night even vital boy because like it even it's very spread out like you wouldn't really be near people but they must have some reason just need us in these New York apartments like you just need to get out I'm sorry parties are living your quarantine with me quarantine is great was it positive Tony I'd like five hundred points already having degree we're getting on Monday though this is a good day okay we got the wine I know you're having Sally hates drinking at home Hey also the shorts are back out in case you haven't noticed honey this year it's actually very warm though okay next stop pizza okay we decided to sit down enjoy the view enjoy the relaxation we had a slice each how was it tough on Erica huh until 50 it's a hole in my runner enjoy till 4:00 here in the corn thinking I get new shoes I really need to get new runners I think it's from Rome bugs and I'm like running like that but we got a slice each it's actually really peaceful not many people around date night quarantine stuff morning everyone it is Saturday we had such a kind of a chill night I suppose he'd say last night we just watched a movie had that wine had our pizza I actually went to bed really early as well I've been so tired and I don't know why like I've never been doing less but sometimes I think that makes you more tired so I'm definitely gonna go for like even maybe a longer walk today get loads of fresh air and also do a workout I actually talked yesterday at my rest day I'd worked out every day this week except for yesterday and I'll work out Saturday Sunday as well so I'm trying to do like six workouts a week I usually aim to do five like when this whole thing isn't happening and but I think the more we can do at the moment the better so I'll do workout today but first I just washed my hair and I'm not going to go into too much detail but I figured I'd quickly show you like my current routine like the shampoo conditioner oils all that kind of stuff okay so at the moment I've been using the new launch from Kerastase I am obsessed with Kerastase they're like my dream brand to work with hopefully someday but basically this is the new line they launched and it's targeted for people with like you know when you brush your hair like I know me anyway I brushed my hair and next thing I see like hair's just falling everywhere I walk around the apartment I see my hair like long red hairs all over the place like I think in my hair is just prone to breakage I guess cuz I've heard it a lot and I have quite a lot of hair so this line is actually targeted for someone like me to help stop that breakage I'm absolutely been loving it packaging is so nice it smells amazing and when I met with the brand like the PR they were talking about this and they were saying that the smell of the shampoo and conditioner stays and you're here and honestly I didn't really believe them because I feel like it stays in your hair for like an hour after and then it goes away but I swear with this shampoo and conditioner I don't know how they've done it but even the next day I can still I can still smell it in my hair like tomorrow I'll still be able to smell it so I really really love this and then my blow dryer routine what I do is so I kind of lightly brush my hair for blow dryers your hair is very prone to breakage when you're brushing it when it's wet you have to be super careful with it and then I'll pop in some of this gives you called air polishing primer it's basically like kind of a protectant you can put on your hair and it also like speeds up the drying process and again I really think that this work so I'll pop that all over my hair not too much kind of like a pea-sized amount then I will blow dry it I just have this like random blow dryer actually do have a Dyson coming them but I'll use that for now and then afterwards I'm gonna pop in some oil I'm not gonna style my hair today I'm gonna just leave it natural I'm not gonna straighten it or curl it so I'm gonna put lots of this oil on the ends to keep it really healthy so that's my current routine it does change a lot as you can see I'm obsessed with hair products I have like two whole sections down here like I love trying different hair products I'm like testing them out but right now I'm really enjoying this and it's keeping my hair very healthy so gonna dry my hair now and then I think I'm gonna do some time I just feel like I should look I'm very pale I need to like scrub off my neck a little bit more but I'm gonna pop on some time make myself feel good and then we're going I get ready to comb over to Caitlin's and do the whole banana bird bake-off and I think they're making us breakfast as well just like eggs and stuff so yeah   so this is just blow-dried like very roughly I'm not very good at doing the whole proper blow Jory I'm hoping when I get the Dyson I'd be a bit better and fellies I would like teach me but for now this is fine obviously I don't really have anywhere to go today so doesn't matter and it's a go it's a good chance to give our hair a break as well so just try and like limit your styling and stuff unless you have to because our hair will be very thankful for it so that's that I'm gonna pop on some tan now next so you would have seen in my last video I have a little ten section I have to just add these two in because it's getting a full up here and so I use be perfect time I have used it for like three years now it is the best and I didn't actually have it on all week because I think I'm still adjusting to this new life so I honestly just really want to put it on today I put it on my face and my body I'm just going to do the top half of my body and my face and I know it's gonna make me for the better straightaway so yeah if you want to get some time there's still obviously selling there an Irish business I do have a discount cold it's retro 20 and that's still working at this time and I think that they're having some sales and stuff as well so definitely check them out and if you're running out it's a nice time if you can to support them so I'm gonna pop that out now and then I will check in after transformation also ignore all the boxes I'm starting my tidy up around place and okay I feel so much better it looks paying off because the lights very bright but this will develop throughout the day it's not sticky it's so nice on I used the strawberry mousse this time and I also did my face and I just put a tiny bit of foundation and I actually don't even need that much foundation when I have the tan on it just goes on really nice and smooth and it's Brico just start to get a little bit better but anyway okay so the banana bread is ready to go I haven't shown you I'll show you when we go over this is it also mean kinda like we never right next door to each other literally the buildings like there's one yeah there's like one door in between us so we're very close and we literally just see each other the Ford was at the moment I suppose it's kind of like our family here where I'll stay away from my everyone so we're so grateful to have each other and as you can see we're just trying to keep us occupied as possible but like this is one I'm kind of nervous I'm not gonna lie it looks nice but the middle kind of like dipped so I can I let it cool the middle is like I don't know I don't know if it's like fully cooked in the middle but here we go hi I have no choice at this stage so we're gonna go over now they are also making us like eggs and stuff and we will see who already convinced you gonna win you know it's a goddess I'm not overly confident don't mean boys okay one once I just set my reaction is where to go what I followed it oh my god no it looks dark on camera I don't know I tried swear not to get too old in like this you know what it takes I think it's gone - Caze nice Jory's looks lovely how did you do that father okay we're gonna just call us let's give it to the moon okay it's about taste well caught a slice half the first half slice will be hot and half will be cold and they can decide I think mine no taste little it's a sugar inert yeah but I also put chocolates maybe it's just a chocolate that's making people do it later cocoa powder no chocolate chips yeah don't think you should've thought that just because of top of fitness it's been on the recipe that take it out in the cups goals and what yellow bits coming right now to them for an hour at 7:00 hour I did 55 minutes when it was the last five minutes but what I'd like to do this I don't want to give them the English because do we follow the same recipe okay so we bought it don't ski it but I did the and and and warning we don't say I'm opening it now buddy so let's see how look oh very happy with that and I will say okay so this is the slice Bobbi I still like a big one yeah begonia you have to be tuna one for each 24 appearances and I don't have to do have hard half cold which song so we need two slices yeah so then we need another one for the other person they're not going to share you can put on a red but maybe your mouth isn't so good I just like you think there's an old person testing okay time for Erica's reveal the PlayStation okay one second let me just show you this off Phyllis guy that looks really good be a bit more Royce or is enough though okay they like this my name oh my god stop okay come on okay my second crowd okay how is it so Jerry I don't wanna flower today looks like possibly looks quite noise doesn't look too bad in the middle but I just thought it's not really different to what I imagined it's not like the Starbucks one it does look like the Starbuck for a little bit but a little bit Erica it actually is not really together very well let's take that into account you know it's all about the taste I think about that packages you used for flower are you so freezing power are you supposed to you are you just chocolate chips okay I'll put these in now okay okay ready so I have another one yeah okay I'll put these in the microwave be back in a minute guys  okay so we have to yeah you can open your eyes of course you can open your eyes David okay so we have these are heated up you can put on some butter and then these are coals which we will taste after so go ahead okay David what's your this looks firm this looks kind of fluffy softly okay you tell me how about you look at them they look quite different look this is I can I kind of like Starbucks this much much bigger this one has a harem okay okay do this other firm one first okay that's right a styrofoam which one I'd like to start with that one okay and then taste the other one it's not gonna stop like okay now on to the coals options David and Tommy this is really down to the bread life and the door what do you taste is there any shows nothing notes in this they David talked about this one now I need like more time or something it needs more time just assume so tell me who's more earring a better texture like I just don't I just want a better texture okay which one tastes better Wow okay you can be on the side which one is better there's more if you take those two braids okay so okay so which is your favorite pick one big braid oh well that means we have a winner that's what happened morning like two boys actually thought that it tasted nice and off didn't it amazing here Oh doc what is a humble winner over here in the corner you wouldn't eat both of them oh oh you would okay okay taste mine count and see what you think thing is you're the expert these days there's no points we'll turn it into it it is very like a cake yeah it's very Airy not stuck together I think you should use an Alabama sugar that's what keeps it together points brown sugar it would've been even darker but you're on the ground okay very Airy but it does seem nice though okay go on taste the cake tastes good tastes really good Oh lieutenant
