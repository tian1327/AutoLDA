   because I'm about to take down my braids that I've had in for like almost my son when was like I'm trying to think of when was that I was actually gonna hold out when these braids and so corn thing was over but I just really connect it's like I can throw right now and in order for my skin to get right like I have to just clean I need to clean my hair because I mean my hair in my face is migrated together so I need to clean my hair and I need to get back on my everything like I was eating a bit eating so many bad snakes I have a bacon my stuff like I'm supposed to be doing so I just need to get back on to my routine because my skin just is like really not it right now so I'm not thinking in the shower and I'm gonna go ahead and take these branches down and over you know give my hair some cleaning I don't know what I'm gonna do to my hair up under my league but it a will we'll figure it out this is just so much hey y'all so I just got done taking the braids down I think I'm gonna do a deep treatment or a hair mask in my hair too because it definitely needs it but imma go ahead and get in the shower because like I can't see oh my so I'm gonna throw my hue  oh hey uh so I think the last uh um but it was probably when I was like sitting in the same spot but my knee I was down and I had just kind of shower whatever but this is the next day and I just put it up in a ponytail now because I mean eventually in my hair it's gonna be lying right back into a slip back by like I was swinging off so that I don't come out because girl nobody has any idea what it is but um yeah everything all day I'm so sorry because I was actually feeling today I found I found the new ring light video and their Q&A which I'm filming the Q&A part of it tomorrow but I found the unboxing of the ring light today so probably I might try to do like the behind the scenes of me filming tomorrow and you know just a lot of other stuff but I just wanted to come and check in on y'all because I hadn't seen since I got a shower last night so yeah I'm back to getting ready for bed now though like it's my time at this point but I also wanted to show y'all like I've been using my um my skincare products I was just about to pick them up and show y'all but not yet I've been using them literally they came in on what is today today used I don't know what city today is but I know that they came I know I've been using them for like three days straight now so whenever that was but I did take my before pictures before I started using them these are products that I already used like a nother long time ago I use these products like last year when my skin was super clear I just ran out of them and I never did I haven't been back to my dermatologist but thankfully the way that my dermatologist have set up the products that I use he sells them on his website so I was able to go on there and just purchase the same things that he had put me on back then and I'm back using them now and they're already doing what I thought they would do even out my skin tone and like this just looks so much better than in the air a few days ago but I will be uploading I think you're losing or real soon so y'all stay on the lookout today because these products y'all can't order even though they're from a dermatologist okay but I see on tomorrow when I get to working or whatever we're doing tomorrow is like day 1,000 of quarantine and at this point I'm starting to get over it but oh well hey uh so I am out the house today groan and got out and I'm probably going to stop and imma try something that
