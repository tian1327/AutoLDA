 hello everyone welcome back to another video another quarantine vlog just really been enjoying this time to relax read books go for really long walks watch the sunset I've been cooking or attempting to cook I've been just really enjoying having a lot more time and energy to myself enjoying the beautiful weather so yeah it's been really nice when the bars are closed you have to make your own creative solution this is this little area in my college campus with these little bar like don't really need to be wearing my mask these little bar stool type of setup my Rose a cider chocolate tart back in my college campus it's a peaceful place to be there's like this little quad courtyard area so I was just sitting there reading a book and wow so many memories here this is the building where most of my classes where most of the like the gen ed classes and I took a philosophy class in that building and then like history science science is like over there but all this is the art building so my major was electronic design and multimedia so I did graphic design and then I took classes in animation video multimedia not getting any sleep working on projects all night because at the time in school I was also working part time but it was basically full-time hours that I was working so I was just working constantly didn't really have a life work work work school school school all-nighters not really good for your mental spiritual emotional health during my senior thesis all the students who are in senior thesis had 24 hour access to the building so we would be in here all night working on our projects rolling into class at 9:00 a.m. no sleep because we just had to do it and when you have deadlines and your work needs to be in a gallery show and you have to finish up what you need to do then you just make it happen while you're also holding down a full or part-time job so just a crazy life I don't know how I had energy for it I love that all the bars or not I mean the bars that are still open are doing things to go currently at the bar having my huge 32 ounce beer I was just really craving dropped beer and yeah obviously bars are closed right now so they're doing to go but the only to go containers are these like 32 ounce containers alone it's funny because people say like don't drink alone it's so depressing but yeah I don't see any problems with drinking alone it's just you know you work hard all day go outside relax have a beer I really miss yeah I just I miss bars I miss going to happy hour after work it's just such a nice experience after a long day's you just have a beer and unwind and relax so having my own little bar experience it's okay yeah I can't remember the last time I've had drafted beer and I was just really craving it  Wow we have our ring light set up this is so bright I'm gonna film a little message from the fathers for our church social media pages and so we're doing a little setup here and have our background just waiting for them to be ready yeah we've been live streaming all the masses but I thought it would be good to have a little personal message from the priests to people who are watching at home we are people of faith we always walk with Fay because we know that our God will never abandon us no matter what's happening no matter what's going on he is with us going through and he will never he will never disappoint us

el nombre del padre del hijo del esp√≠ritu santo coming Bendis yonus okay so I came grocery shopping this is really overwhelming because I'm making this new recipe I don't know I do this to myself but it calls for green chillies Chile is going to be where they need jalapenos now I feel like it has to be around here somewhere okay so this is uncharted territory but we're in the spice aisle and Wow there's just so many options and I don't know how people know what to do with all this stuff Wow Wow like what is all this also I didn't know there were so many different types of adobo what okay I've been looking for these chilies for so long I think I'm in a more promising section of the store this is like that the hot sauce area it seems like they should be here I'm so dumb that our chilies jalapenos like is it the same thing New York City recently got rid of plastic bags so I go to the store buying all my stuff realized it didn't have a bag with me and they don't have bags there enough to basically bring your own or else you get nothing they have boxes and I'm like I'm too weak to carry a box I need something with handles that I can hold and something like agonizing what do I do die go home and come back which is really annoying I know this woman she's like here I have an extra one and so she gave me back so as I'm leaving she's walking to die and I was like thank you again she's like oh no problem the only way we're gonna get through this insanity is together and I was like thank you the crime so anyway thought it was really nice just such a nice thing a stranger differently and it provided me of the beauty of humanity and how we really do need each other we can't we're in such an isolating time and it's like every time we go in public everyone's avoiding eye contact keeping to themselves keeping their distance afraid of each other and having this moment I haven't had in a really long time with the stranger all right today is the day making a new recipe this is terrifying and exciting the best the best healthy crock-pot chicken chili they say it's easy to make but for normal people it's easy for me this is really hard because all this stuff have to cut up this has been going for four hours now chicken and salsa has been like boiling in their pieces when they say things like this cook on high for three to four hours or until chicken can be easily shredded with a fork what does that mean or like three to four hours it's a whole hour difference and then what do I do like every hour just check it to see so after three hours if it's not easily shredded oh god I do another hour you know like how does that work okay so we're on step three towards the end of cooking add onion peppers carrots I didn't buy carrots carrots optional minced garlic this is so embarrassing to admit the like what how do you what is minced garlic how do I do that like I don't even know what to do with this we'll find out chopped up the onions and I have to add these on to the pan with olive oil but it doesn't say how much olive oil to put I wish it was like add one tablespoon or I'd like however much I don't know how much to put so what does that mean left old me that what we chopped garlic so I could have just used that well now I know how to mince the garlic and kitchen is already mess so we shredded the chicken I think that's shredded hopefully and the veggies next we have to add the diced tomatoes  added diced tomatoes out of the olives and now I have to add the chilli  and one cup of frozen corn and one cup of frozen peas I don't think my crock pot is big enough for this recipe I'm such an idiot it's currently like filled to the brim and then I love to add all this this is a mess why am i doing this okay we also need a can of black beans which I started trying to this isn't gonna fit oh no no okay this is just gonna have to do  okay what do I do next corn peas beans brown sugar okay brown sugar 1/4 a cup of brown sugar I think that's too much Allah oh it feels kind of cool I know I'm touching it like this is that a fourth yeah sure whatever this is a horrible I don't think it's all gonna fit what am I gonna do maybe I take half of it out no I'll just try okay I just stirred it there is no way no that's life there will be a way okay yeah this is gonna work okay all right the chili is done heating up some cornbread this is the taste test because I made chili in the crock-pot no they said it was easy yeah what am i a chemist boil water what am i a chemist so okay I had to mince garlic I just chopped up two onions I had to buy all this random cans of stuff I couldn't even find it call for Chili's in the store and I'm like a can of Chili's I couldn't find it so I just didn't buy it but I put everything else in and actually came out pretty good I'm proud it came out good and I made corn i heated up cornbread the cornbread is so good and yeah I'm really proud I watched a tutorial and the woman was like okay minced garlic you basically peel it first of all you know how to peel garlic which is so embarrassing to admit so first I had to peel it and then you lie it on the cutting board and you like smash the knife down and she was like just think of someone that you don't like and that should make it easier I don't have a proper yoga mat or like exercise mat and I have a wood floor so I just put on a blanket yeah I ordered a yoga mat on like day one of quarantine and then Amazon sent me this message and they were like if you still want it let us know sorry for the delays but it'll be there in May and I'm like are you kidding I ordered it in March so I just cancelled the order and never bought any one so now I have no yoga mat and I'm just using a blanket reverse crunches oh nine ten eleven and a weird I'm a gamer I don't work out ah how many seconds 30 seconds how many seconds over yet what's the count what's the count I said every five seconds give me the numbers why are you speaking tell
