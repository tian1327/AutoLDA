 Getting Starbucks in a Pandemic I live in NYC. I've been in quarantine for 60+ days. I haven't seen my friends or family. I've only left my apartment for walks. I'm incredily lucky to be safe and healthy but there are a lot of things I miss. Like going out for coffee :( But Starbucks is open again and I'm going in! It's open for pickup only So order in the app first To go is the only option Tip after you order! I could only add a tip if I went back in the app after I ordered Safety First These are the things I bring with me
whenever I go anywhere outside my apartment now: hand sanitizer  and gloves. Gloves are pretty hard to find so sometimes I use
these baggies instead. Of course, I'm gonna wear a mask. First, I'm gonna put on
a Pitta mask, one of those Japanese masks. It's like a thin polyurethane material, and then on top of that to be extra safe I'm just gonna wear a basic
cloth mask. This is two layers so altogether I have three layers between
me and my germs and the outside world. And last it's time for me to put on my
gloves, AKA those packaging baggies I showed
earlier. For a while it was really hard to get gloves and I didn't want to take
them away from hospital employees or essential employees who were being
exposed to a lot more risk every day than I was. So for my purposes I've just
been using these bags or like a bread bag or kind of any bag you can find,
but I feel like these work really well because they're pretty much hand-sized
if you just rip a hole to end. And you can kind of put your hand in and it's
pretty good for things just like picking up a drink. "Hi, I'm here for Chloe" "Chloe?" I got my mask on, got my gloves on,
you go to the door and say your name and then they go and get your drink for you
so it's pretty much like trick-or-treating but for Starbucks. All of the parks now have these big signs telling you to stay away from each other
and you also have police officers or Park Rangers handing out masks to people. I found a spot far enough away from people that I could take off my mask and
actually drink my drink. There are a lot of people out who are obviously not
social distancing and it's very frustrating because those people are the
riskiest things that I encounter in my life. And finally~ Purell! These are the goods! I sanitized my hands, kind of put a little hand sanitizer near the mouth area but some risks I'm just gonna have to take. So excited! This is the first day in over two months that I felt even
somewhat normal. I haven't gone out at all except for a couple walks. I really want to remind everyone of these things which are so important. I wouldn't have
done this if I hadn't thought after a thorough consideration that it was
something I could do safely and responsibly. If you're going to go out
you need to really take these steps to make sure you're safe and also please
tip!
