 in this video I'm gonna be talking about what living in Chicago has been like during these first three months of quarantine lockdown some of the adjustments and challenges that I faced and also what the future in Chicago could look like what's good YouTube is Louis Gustov welcome back to my channel whenever I'm creating a video I think about the potential audience whether that be fellow Chicagoans travelers or people visiting or moving to Chicago this video is for everybody for people who don't live in a big city for my family back in Florida who are curious about what living in Chicago has been like during this time and of course for all my friends and family around the city who can relate and up until now I haven't really talked about this on my channel for a couple of reasons number one I wanted to dig deep creatively and come up with some good content that would stand the test of time no matter what was happening in the news and number two I wanted to talk about this but not until I was really ready till I had time to reflect on my experiences to look towards the future and create something that would be profoundly positive for my channel just before the stay at home order in Chicago was given there was a lot of confusion going around myself I wasn't even certain of what would happen but I did know that it was important to start working from home a little bit more often I continued to go to the gym because they sent an email shirring us that they would remain open step up their cleaning procedures and they really drove home the message on how important it is for your health to stay fit and active pretty soon though things got worse and the stay at home water was given this quarantine has presented many challenges and opportunities to grow since mid-march I've had to completely adjust my daily life and really step up my level of discipline because when you're at home there are potential million distractions to take you off course so here are the five biggest changes in my life since lockdown began the first and most prominent way my life has changed has been work I haven't been to the office since mid-march in my day in the life of a software engineer video you guys have seen my daily commute where I work in the loop that has been completely thrown out the window and now I work remotely every single day luckily my company's business has been largely unaffected there have been no layoffs although raises were cancelled for 2020 I'm also very fortunate that software engineering is a job that can be done remotely before the lockdown started I had co-workers that were 100% remote so there wasn't a huge adjustment that my company as a whole has to make moving into the lockdown the second major area of my life that changed was fitness and hobbies shortly after I got the news that my gym would be closing I decided to move to plan be running on the lakefront but unfortunately the people of Chicago really flooded toward that area resulting in the mayor shutting that down too after that my only remaining option was to work out at home but at first all I had was a yoga mat so I decided to buy some adjustable dumbbells and some fitness bands and I really do have a passion for creating my own routines in order to stay fit instead of running my cardio has been jumping jacks and running in place and as far as hobbies go most of the things that I like to do have been shut down for the time being like museums festivals and restaurants that leaves at home entertainment like movies and television shows and of course plan a lot of Animal Crossing my internet connection hasn't been the most reliable during this time but luckily I do have a collection of DVDs and blu-rays that I've been able to fall back on I've also continued to read because luckily that's a hobby that can be done from literally anywhere getting the essentials taken care of has also required major adjustments during this time at the very beginning of the lockdown we went to the grocery store really early because at the time there wasn't a whole lot of information out there so we weren't really fully educated on the potential dangers of being in close proximity with a lot of other people but since then we switched to ordering and getting our groceries delivered right to the doorstep I mentioned earlier how restaurants closed down so what we've done to adjust is enjoying our home-cooked meals stepping up our cooking skills and seeing what creative ways we can create dishes that we love I've also had to cancel things like doctor's appointments dentist appointments and of course my weekly haircut appointment to get that fresh fade my girlfriend has now become my barber but I gotta mention she's been doing a pretty good job my social life has also drastically changed during this time instead of meeting up with my friends for happy hour or going to intelligentsia for an espresso after lunch we've switched over to weekly video conferencing Hangouts I've also utilized this to keep in touch with my family so I can't visit them at the moment I've also attended a birthday party and even a wedding via virtual hangout and finally I've had to make major changes to the content that I've been putting out on this channel we recently passed 700 subscribers but whether you're new here or you've been watching for a while you know that the main essence of this channel is me out and about in the neighborhoods of Chicago or making travel films well for the past several weeks I've had to make all of my content right here from home now if I'm being real a lot of the adjustments that I've had to to my daily routine have been easy but some days have been a struggle it's easy to quarantine when it's wintertime and it's snowing outside or 20 degrees but when the weather starts warming up in April and May and the trees start blooming events start happening and people are used to going out and about then it gets a little bit more difficult and also one of the trade-offs I make living in Chicago in a neighborhood like Lincoln Park is sacrificing space to be in an area where there's a lot going on so it's a little bit difficult when all of those things are shut down and you're confined to a smaller space without a backyard without a rooftop deck really confined to these 450 square feet on a daily basis well like I said I've been fortunate in a lot of ways during this quarantine lockdown my job can be completely done remotely I've had my girlfriend with me day in and day out to help adjust to this new type of life and I'm very positive about the outlook of Chicago things have started to reopen we're now in Phase three of the reopening process so restaurants have begun to open small businesses have begun to open of course with some guidelines and certain restrictions in place but I take that as a positive sign that we will be okay we're gonna get through this it may take some more time it may take some more adjustment on our behalf and we may never return to our version of what was normal but what I think is most important is to use this time as an opportunity to grow to look forward to a better tomorrow Chicagoans are a tough and resilient people that are used to getting through difficult times and coming out stronger on the other end so what is the future in Chicago look like the stay at home order is not over and I mentioned earlier how restaurants and small businesses are starting to reopen I know that a lot of other things are gonna remain closed like museums and possibly parks a lot of summer events that we know and love are going to be canceled personally I purchased some good quality mass so I can start going outside again and yesterday my girlfriend and I went for our longest walk in months we went to the park just to appreciate the outdoors I still haven't heard anything from my gym so I have no idea when and how they plan to reopen my company has told us that the earliest possible time we can return to the office is in September and as far as this channel goes we're all about traveling and highlighting the best of Chicago this is my hometown and I'm so proud of it I will continue to showcase the people and things that make this city the greatest in the world now I want to know how you guys have dealt with quarantine lockdown what your
