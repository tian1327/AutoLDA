  okay you guys so i am in houston wait let me back up and show you how i got to houston  so here's the thing i was supposed to deadhead from denver all the way here to houston this morning but because i live in atlanta i waved my dead head and i can mute it directly from atlanta to here to houston i've been here this morning since about 8 30 it is currently 5 45 yeah all right we're on the g7 galley today i think we do one flight on this plane here's tiara cohort  okay so we can further social distance on the aircraft now the c flight attendant sits in row one c d that's the ioc so we don't have to share the jumpsuit with the a flight attendant so we can encourage a better social business between crew members now the sea flight attendant sits in row a president of the ioc same as the d flight attendant on the 800 aircraft there are four four members and there's the flight attendant the d flight attendant will sit in the last row and they will occupy the ioc as well  you can remember i stayed at this hotel in this vlog i am back i am in a slightly different room but just as nice take a look  wiping down my room and i'm really tired today was a long day my work day wasn't long but today was a long day like i mentioned earlier i ended up waving my dead head on the front end and not commuting to denver so i waved my dead head and i just commuted from atlanta to houston there have been a lot of flight cancellations so i had to take the early flight so i'm tired i didn't sleep that long last night and then today i got up early and so yeah i have a short overnight tonight it's only 11 hours so they told me to take all of this stuff out and then put my food in  my age just messaged me and told me that there is a suite downstairs with a refrigerator in it so now i'm about to pack my things back up in my lunchbox to take it downstairs because basically this fridge just keeps your stuff kind of chill it doesn't keep it cold  good morning you guys so i wanted to show you my view of my balcony here in salt lake city it is kind of chilly here today but here's my view did it you're good yes we're good thank you  okay this morning we are on these 700 aircraft  i've already pre-flighted my exit row area and we're about to get ready to board   okay we made it to our first stop of san diego we had six passengers on that flight so now we have a two hour sit here in san diego a sit is basically the time that you sit in the airport waiting until you work your next flight okay you guys we are done with our two-hour sit that we had here in san diego we are on a new aircraft it is an 800. we have a new crew member we have an additional crew member because there are 38 passengers putting on this flight i am definitely wearing the mask the entire time i'm on the plane usually i only wear the mask when i'm in the air because it's just it's the same air but because we have 38 passengers booked that is the most i've had since this whole situation happened  we made it to denver so we just have one more flight left we go to louisville kentucky and we have a 16 hour overnight there thank goodness because last night was way too short looks like he's done that before right  i had to check under the bed because it wasn't solid huge bathroom my schedule got changed for tomorrow so tomorrow we were just supposed to have two flights we were supposed to fly from here in louisville to tampa and then um do tampa back to denver but our last leg got cancelled our leg back to denver from tampa got canceled so i was like super pumped i'm like yay they're probably gonna just dead it did hit us to denver and then i can um just wave that and go back home to atlanta but no we have a deadhead to kansas city and then we work a flight from kansas city back to denver so yeah that kind of sucks but it's a part of the job so i'm basically gonna miss the last flight out of denver back to atlanta tomorrow i was gonna miss it anyway but i was kind of like hoping to get back into denver a little bit early tomorrow but it doesn't even matter now because they changed our schedule so one thing that i did not talk to you guys about was my schedule and how it kind of got affected by everything that's going on right now so basically what happened is um i have four trips on my board i have four but i have vacation this month whenever we have vacation they can't sell not cancel they remove your trip that you have during your vacation and you get paid for that trip plus your vacation right so they removed that trip what i did was i picked up another trip during my vacation and then that got canceled because of everything that's going on and then i had another trip next weekend that also got cancelled so this is technically my last trip of the month now do i want to work some more this month yes do i want to be on reserve no so i'm trying to find a couple of trips to pick up this month but i really haven't been able to find anything when i say i've been stalking the website that we checked to get trips i have been like stalking it so hopefully i can find something to work but again this is technically my last trip of the month but i don't want it to be um i don't have a refrigerator in my room so i called downstairs and the guy at the front desk told me to bring my lunch bag down they will store it for me then when i get down there they're like oh we can send you a refrigerator to your room and i'm like seriously so i get to my room i'm waiting and then they call me and they're like oh i'm sorry we don't have any more refrigerators but they sent somebody up to grab my lunch bag so they told me to call and they'll bring it up or i can stop on the way down to get it i don't have to report to 1 15 tomorrow so i'm definitely going to get up and exercise or do something  so  all right we made it to the aircraft we are on an 800 this afternoon so we only have one flight on this plane and then we're supposed to deadhead to kansas city afterwards and then we're supposed to work a flight from kansas city back to denver and then that'll be my day today i'd like to point out the safety features firewalk 737-800 a safety information card is located in that seat back or later to your pocket in front of you two fasten your seat belt  relief so we made it to tampa we are walking to our gate so we can catch our deadhead flight to kansas city and then after kansas city we're supposed to work a flight to denver  alright we are in kansas city headed to our plane  okay you guys so i am done with my trip now i have something to tell you um i apologize in advance if this goes over anyone's head but this is a thing so with the whole situation that's going on in the world right now of course all of our flights got cancelled not all but several of our flights got canceled we had re-routes things like that well my company in addition to several policies have this thing where if your trip got rescheduled to where you have a earlier report time or you get released later more than one hour then the company will get you a hotel room so here i am in a hotel room because i missed the last flight out back to atlanta so yes it sucks that i couldn't go home tonight but at least i have a hotel room to enjoy this hotel room is really really nice this is my first time being here and i'm going to show it to you right now this is the bathroom look at this so there is a button right here where you can actually close this because clearly this is a window and it's the bathroom and the toilet is right here so we're going to shut that then when you come out there is a mirror right here and then there are two beds here's the closet and then all of this and then i'm gonna close this as well so in the last
