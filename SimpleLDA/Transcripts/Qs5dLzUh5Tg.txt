 hi everybody and welcome back to a new vlog today's vlog is going to be an at-home vlog but there's been a slight change in plans we are running to the grocery store today is currently Friday the 13th and I want to talk about a few things I'm not gonna harp on them too long but I have had a lot of DMS and messages about the coronavirus what we are doing how we are handling it and here's the thing I don't talking about it I know can be really stressful for people I know that some people are trying to avoid hearing about it and then there's other people who really want me to talk about it and explain and to be honest I don't know it's so scary um I don't know I'm learning just as the news comes out I'm learning day by day I'm literally taking it day by day and I think that's what we have to do I also think it's best to try and remain calm and if we don't have to go out in public don't go out in public I know I'm saying I'm running to the grocery store but that is because I got a call from my dad and he's at the store and he said if you guys need to get stuff get stuff now because unfortunately um I think panic has set in the stores are being wiped clean and there's pretty much nothing um so I'm just gonna make a grocery list I'm not panicking I'm not buying 50 rolls of toilet paper if you are that's totally fine and my friends back up in Ohio oh my gosh they're posting pictures of grocery store shelves that they're empty if there's nothing left people aren't able to get diapers for their kids they're not able to get food so things are getting very intense so we decided maybe we should go to the store we're gonna brave it I don't know why we're going and of all places we're going to Walmart because it's right next door to the pet store well we need to get like sees food Walmart's gonna be a madhouse I hate going to Walmart on Fridays and hello coronavirus shoppers so originally Larry and I had friends coming in town I think March 28th now I don't know if that's happening I haven't talked to them yet about that we haven't all figured that out yet because all of us are just taking it day by day but we were supposed to go to Universal Studios the first week Apryl now they are supposed to be open by the first week of April as of now who knows going forward if this virus progresses who knows but I don't know if we're going anymore at this point I don't think it's a good idea to go I don't really know and this may be terrible but I didn't really prepare I only have ten cans of wet food for Alexi I need to get her food and I'd like to pick up a few things for Larry and I as well just in case things shut down now yesterday Universal and Disney did announce that they were shutting down until the end of the month and then I'm getting a lot of questions do I know if they'll be open in April do I know if they'll be open in May and I'm so honored that you guys are asking me it makes my day that you guys asked me but I I don't know I really I really don't know I don't know I guess I as of now I think they will be open I want to read you guys something that I've posted over on my Instagram stories I know a lot of people are panicking a lot of people are depressed they're freaking out at home and you know they're watching YouTube videos I wasn't gonna vlog today because we're redoing the kitchen so the house is an absolute mess so I'm actually double blogging I'm vlogging like a day in the life video you know to help you guys out and I love vlogging anyways but just to give you guys something to do at home if you're quarantined at home or if you're just you mean some kind of happiness going on that's where this blog is gonna come in handy hopefully although I did briefly speak about the corona virus but I've had a lot of questions about that but anyways I wasn't gonna vlog today because the kitchen is being redone which brings me to explain that I'm double vlogging so yes I've had lots of questions if I'm vlogging the kitchen I am we if you guys are watching my Instagram stories we started painting the cabinet's yesterday wow did I underestimate what goes into painting cabinets it is first you have to sand the cabinets down well actually no I lied first you have to use Dawn dish soap or any kind of soap that's going to cut through grease so we had to wipe all the cabinets and then you have to dry it then you have to sand the cabinets and then you have to wipe off the cabinets and then you have to prime the cabinets and then paint the cabinets we did the corner cabinet first which it's sitting in there it is done but I'm not thrilled with it it has quite the texture on it so Larry and I need to figure out a few things with that today we're gonna test that but that's gonna be in a whole nother video because I am double blogging originally I thought this kitchen video would be up next week now I don't know because painting cabinets was a lot harder than I thought it was I severely underestimated it but I'm gonna read you guys something that I posted over an Instagram I said everyone remember to stay calm and stay informed because I do think it's really important number one to stay calm not to panic it is a very scary situation of course but remaining calm try to try to stay calm because it is scary but be informed watch the news stay informed on the virus stay informed on what's going on I said I've been getting many questions on what Larry and I are doing to prepare and what my thoughts are on the coronavirus I said honestly my thoughts are to Keep Calm stay informed wash your hands and at this point limiting me out amount of public places you visit if you don't have to go out don't which I definitely recommend if you don't have to go out don't I didn't want to go out today but if things shut down I don't necessarily have everything that we would need here so that's why we are going out I don't like saying too much in each situation because we all need to just take a breath and take it day-by-day but remained informed I have a feeling things will intensify over the next few weeks sanitize those hands and for goodness sake invest in some unscented waster Iser on Santa unscented moisturizer for your hands I thought it was  but it's not that funny now but yeah so anyways moral of the story is the corona virus is here it's intense and we just need to prepare and you know what let's make this a positive thing take this time I know if you if people are upset if you have the opportunity and you can stay at home or you're forced to stay at home take this as an opportunity to relax watch some movies read some books clean things in the house that you wanted to do do a deep spring clean do things that you wouldn't normally be able to do because you're so busy and running around and doing life now for those of you who do have to work like if you work in health care or first responders oh my goodness I love you guys I think about you all the time when I worked in health care before YouTube really kind of took off I worked in health care and there was a hurricane you were supposed to be at work no matter what if there's a whatever you're meant to be at work and that's just how it goes so my thoughts are with you guys I also know that there are people out there that are being quarantined right now I know things in Italy are extremely intense I know this started over in China and then it went you know everywhere in and I have a friend in China and he was basically saying it's just insane how things change because when he was telling us all about it it was over there and it wasn't here in the US yet and now it's here and things are and he was saying that things are getting a little bit better over there but it's just I don't know I just our thoughts and prayers are out to those who are quarantined I don't know if that's gonna happen here in the US but they are closing things down here also I'm really concerned about those who are out of work or out of jobs or that are on unpaid leave but it's just really a dark time in a way it's something that's scary in my 20 years I've never seen anything like it I'm not twenty in my 28 years I should say I've never seen anything like it my grandfather he's 80 he's never seen anything like it so it's just a learning experience for all of us and something that I'll just need to come together around and support one another and I know that a lot of people are so scared and very anxious by it and they have the right to be and everybody is gonna react differently I don't think it's right either to put people down like there's some people out there that are panicking and there are some people out there that are like oh there it's no big deal I get it people are gonna have their opinions I totally understand that but we also need to all respect people's feelings emotions and reactions to all of this at least I think that it would be nice that we do you don't have to but I think it would be nice to respect people's views and opinions on the situation yeah very I'm an Aries coming out a bit what are we talking about Clara virus coronavirus yeah I just think that everybody should just you know try to remain calm yeah like that guy in Animal House panic I think it's more exactly I know my family were talking about not giving them another this weekend because of my grandpa he's in his 80s he's very fragile and yeah but I don't know what we're doing with that but anyways we need to get going to the store and I just wanted to add those two things Larry always has the best advice I don't even remember what I said I have such a bad headache yeah I've got a headache I'm tired no we don't have the coronavirus I don't think those from trying to remodel the kitchen just right yeah yes and I also said that it's important to respect everybody's you know reactions to this they don't have to but I think it would be nice to not tease or make fun of people who are upset because it's shocking this is not something that's ever happened before well it has happened before this reminds me of Downton Abbey in the Spanish blue honestly like the way all that was like an epidemic that just anyways I don't - anyways yeah anyways it's here but we're gonna deal with it the best that we can I'm just filming on my phone so if the audio sounds a little bit different that is perfect but everything's normal here  really is out - there's nothing there's literally nothing are you kidding all of the allies saw and bleach cleaner is gone at Walmart they do have pledged and fabuloso but when it comes to the other killing germs items they don't have anything they have Scrubbing Bubbles they have a my saw mold and mildew foamer with bleach but in general the regular lye souls and all the bleach cleaners are gone the water is just about empty it's a lot of people waiting for water we only took does work how about that all right we survived the Walmart madness sanitizing now of course and then now we are on our way to pets Mart we need to grab Lexy her food we figured we get Walmart out of the way because that would probably be the most chaotic place which it was and then Larry and I are gonna munch on these little racy eggs now because we are hungry the lunch of champions and we need something so we got a lot of stuff I'm actually gonna share it with you guys miss your mindset does kind of change when we go out in public and see how everybody's reacting here we're fine no panic or anything a lot of people but I think the only the only panic we saw somebody dropped a case of wine and then juice yeah but there was a lot of people and a lot of stuff fun all right there's still a lot of stuffs available too except for toilet paper there really is no toilet paper that really is a thing I can't believe that where has all the toilet paper gone all the papers gone Clorox bleach Lysol any of cleaners like that gone hand soaps gone oh I hope that fish is my brown bird Oh cute we've got a bit of a migraine I had to take a migraine pill so it's making me hmm he's got Reese's too I understand the struggle he's got to take a break Bart hey you shouldn't eat that stuff that'll kill ya okay so we've just arrived at Petsmart just found out that President Trump has officially declared the what is it called national emergency national emergency so hmm here we go it could be kitty Hall we just came to Publix because we actually need toilet paper and there's literally no toilet paper and it's the same thing at Publix they have certain cleaners but no bleach cleaners at all which I mean fabuloso and pine-sol just aren't gonna do it OxiClean and Clorox pool is that oh that's freaking laundry detergent this is unbelievable Larry's quick saving save the fact that we actually don't have toilet paper at home - four rolls so if you guys are in need of toilet paper and they actually have it Larry thought I'll run the dollar store really quick see if they have any and he picked us up he picked us up some single rolls so were they out of the full packages yeah they were all out of the full packages but they had a few single rolls so we grabbed some they had single rolls and they also had a nine tube roll okay interesting yeah it's actually a real thing the toilet paper crisis is a real thing I didn't realize it until you actually go out in the stores and experience it so all the jokes online are like actually a thing all over the place not just in Ohio it's important it's probably everywhere where you guys are at - anyways we were officially done with our shopping we survived we're in the parking lot still at Publix but we are headed home yes and I'll show you guys everything that we picked up mmm we are back we are finally home and I am gonna share everything that we picked up I have it all lined up on the counter right behind me and I yeah I do want to throw out I'll let you guys know my last video was a grocery haul but that video was filmed like a week and a half ago a long time ago it kind of was so it's not like we just went and now we're going again so just wanted to throw that out there because I'm sure a lot of you guys are gonna be like didn't you just go so yeah I'm gonna show you everything that we picked up now so glad we're home it is currently five o'clock so everything that I originally had plans for this vlog is totally not happening we were out way later than we anticipated I have a migraine and I think we're just gonna like put all the food away all the stuff that we got away gonna eat dinner we're gonna have a cozy night in and watch the movie what do you think babe I think that's a great plan yeah we both are kind of sore from rolling painting scraping things and sweeping and cleaning and yeah I actually decided I originally also I originally had the spring home tour going up on Saturday however I have decided I am going to move it to Monday and edit this tonight and get it up for you guys tomorrow because I think it's more relevant to upload it now instead of waiting until Monday so as soon as I'm done filming this I'm gonna get to work on editing and you guys are gonna see this literally tomorrow so I just think that that would be a better idea might help some of you guys out as well and I have to get busy into a video as you go up on Sunday yes you do which I need to edit as well the grocery items that we picked up there is a few bulk items there's a lots of noodles you're gonna be like oh I thought you said don't panic and here you are getting a bunch of stuff well we burn through our noodle supply last night yeah that too and and too when you're in the store and you're seeing things happening and things flying off the shelves you're like okay maybe we should grab a few of those things before they're all gone like a toilet favorite situation is real but yeah okay enough of that I'm gonna show you guys what we found what we picked up what we are going to survive off of and yeah let's get into it all right so we're gonna start here so we picked up these the puffs tissues this was actually found at Walmart we decided to grab them because we actually don't have toilet paper and we're like oh my gosh what if we actually don't find it so we grew up these then Larry ran over - no that's true they're not good for plumbing so it's a good thing Larry ended up running to the dollar store and finding some toilet paper for us so lucky us we actually had toilet paper and then this is for the lanai for our rough spots I showed you guys that on Instagram I was talking about the lanai spot so we're gonna give that a try got something back here no there's not larry's propel waters he got two of those I got beef broth this is my favorite I just ran out today actually I only have one cube left so I grabbed more broth picked up egg noodles at Publix this is a mix of a haul from Publix and Walmart and obviously the dollar store oh thanks babe you'll have to peel back the cover so the egg noodles at Publix were buy one get one so I grabbed two of those the Milano cookies were also buy one get one so I grabbed dark chocolate and mint chocolate nyquil for cold and flu dr. teals oh my gosh this looks lovely it's the soothe and sleep with lavender so I picked that up the pure this is the water filter that we have in the fridge that I get my water out of we needed new filters so I grabbed some of those ramen noodles because they last they fill you up and just because now we don't and the results that we see from the unit that's in the fridge opposed to yes so we're actually we took that one off the sink we're not gonna use it anymore and we went back to our original peer filters that we're gonna use

this was ten dollars and he's like well mine was ten dollars I said but it has a light yeah and it works perfectly I just really wanted the little light it's that bad for my protein shakes a lot of
