 mont√≥n rationale here and today we're gonna talk about the dating scene and see yeah now when I first got to see how I noticed an unusually significant amount of honey's walking around you named the area of the city I seen him honeys they were cute they were diverse they were open to talking to you they're very available and those honey's were everywhere you compare this to places like LA and Seattle the people aren't preoccupied with only their own careers here in Seattle people like to interact and the outdoors they like to be with family they like to spend time with friends and people that they are close to you and in a way it's different because everyone's there to promote their own career now in Texas I would say there's a little more family-oriented and that's more similar to living in Seattle as far as those kind of people that you're living with that you're interacting with all the time in Texas it's much more based around religion you can't escape that the Christianity is a big part of living in Texas and that's just the culture there here in Seattle it doesn't seem to me like religion is a big deal here at all it's a very progressively thinking place right now you can say that for all the amount of people I was introducing myself too and meeting early on since I got here that completely slowed down I mean I fell off a cliff totally and the only reason for that is the lockdown I've taken it even more seriously more recently so you can't introduce new people into your home at this time you know pay that role right now it definitely is a serious situation so there is no dating scene in Seattle right now it's closed there's no bars open now when I first got here and I went out even when this epidemic I knew I could have been at risk but I went out anyway because they didn't realize it wasn't like as known as it wasn't him you know I went out and it was a great scene a lot of a lot of girls out I took it for granted I figured every night would be like that and then all of a sudden we have a situation where we're not going out at all and frankly I can't even film videos for you guys like I would be able to you'll be seeing some videos of me from home and I'll be interesting we'll get a little philosophical there's tons of restaurants to go out to and Danny's gonna be a big part of this channel too so you guys should be excited about that you're gonna see me on dates on this channel this is like a live experiment this channel is gonna be Mountain but I shoot Oh dating Seattle's finest women the social scene here is just gonna explode so once this pandemic is over then what you're gonna see is the dating scene in Seattle is going to really pick up because everyone was bottled up for so long I don't drink anymore but even someone like me is gonna still go out and check out the scene now Who am I gonna attractive place like this such a variety you just don't know it depends at which place you're gonna go we'll be exploring these different scenes in Seattle on this channel will definitely be exploring the dating scene in Seattle and greater depth will be exploring locations in Seattle and greater depth we will be talking about specific individual issues that are important and worth discussing that may or may not be based on current events my plan coming here for the dating scene in Seattle was to go up to as many girls as possible as I possibly can and talk to them get their number get on their mind arrange dates there's a whole other side of the city I have uneven Explorer I haven't gone to West Seattle yet I haven't gone to Queen Anne yet I have so many places in the city that I still have to see Columbia City going out downtown I haven't gone out with my absolute a game in a wardrobe yet I haven't brought that to the table yet and that's gonna happen that was supposed to happen and now that got cut short I'm going nuts I'm going absolutely crazy here someone's gonna have to come and keep me inside here because I'm going out I've decided not to go out nobody's out there's nowhere to go out therefore there's no reason to go out and therefore I will not be going out nor will anyone else be going out therefore I'll be staying in still getting used to this situation here this situation is a big challenge if you like to go out and you were looking at meet new people and you don't want to be stuck at a pandemic so I have to take my game to the next level and activate some internet chance to meet some girls so that when the pandemics over you turn those internet chats into Internet streams
