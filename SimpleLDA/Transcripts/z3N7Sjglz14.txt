been doing so many face masks now that I am home every day and I have so much more like extra time I just did like a hydrating sheet mask and I just feels so good my skin has been feeling really really dry but I feel like overall my skin has been so much better I've been trying to really take care of it since I am in corn sea and I'm trying to come out of corn seed with like glue you good skin I thought I quickly show you like some of the skincare stuff that I've been really liking to use at nights doctor I use on a sheet mask I still want to put on a little bit of serum it's kind of just locked in the moisture and I'm really liking this one it is a naturally serious illumination anti fatigue power serum I've been using this for a while and I really really love it I just Pat it in it's like a nice little glow so I have been using cure ology again I've changed my formula from the acne one that I was using before I'm still testing it out but I will let you guys know how I feel about the results and stuff and maybe a couple of weeks or so right now I'm going to use my eye cream I've been testing this one out I really like it and I like using this especially in the morning but I've been just using it at night as well as a really nice qualia effect because of the applicator ok and now I am going to use my belief true cream Appelbaum this is like one of those products that I will just continue to go back to I love it I've been using it for so long now and it is such a great moisturizer it isn't too heavy but it still provides so much hydration it just did a little virtual workout I do want to do a quick ab workout I'm going to do my quick little 10-minute ab workout I'm going to show you guys what I usually do I find that this helps a lot and it just feels really really good afterwards this is my little setup i got my yoga mat I got it from Amazon it came really quickly and it's really nice actually  Mickey Mouse I got this which is the phone style waffles from Whole Foods really easy to make actually I'm just gonna pop it into the oven for a little bit there's two of these inside there's a lot 24 waffles I wish I knew how to make waffles but I also don't have like a waffle maker this will have to do for now putting six waffles here for me and I am also going to attempt to make whipped coffee so I've tried it twice now and I can't get it and actually I've got a egg beater because I was using just a spoon before and I was mixing it for like 30 minutes it was not working I'm sure you guys I've seen this everywhere I feel like it is such a big trend right now I'm just going to use this instant coffee yeah I'm going to pour a little bit water in here now  this is what it looks like so far it looks really girls it happened you guys look at that third time is the charm buoyant some oat milk in all right let's mix it and try it out really good you guys it's a lot of work though my heart was kind of hurting but it is pretty good this is the finished result I topped it with some strawberries and I'm gonna be using this which is from Trader Joe's it's the organic maple agave syrup blend  we are gonna make some udon tonight this is like one of our favorite meals to me because it's really simple and quick and it tastes so good we use this as these Sufis get different like the Chinese to mark it it's a little sheep hot pot soup base and plain they also have a spicy one which is really good and then we just put some fatty beef slices and then any sort of vegetables we usually do bok choy all right so it is almost done you literally just put everything in here together and boil it it's kind of just like hotpot but it tastes so good YUM this looks so good put some spicy chili oil on it too okay it's happening it's
