said I was going to put different vlogs but a lot of stuff that I had planned just didn't seem right to put that kind of content out a lot of you guys have shared with me that you've lost your job that you're feeling really lonely that you don't know what's gonna happen and so I just decided not to put that content out and just focus on you know Reese entering myself [Music] we always assume that we have more time and this virus has just been a reality check like any day now things can change so I'm like I need to just get focused my goal in life really is to live a full balanced life

rough but we will get through this yeah yeah I totally lied I said that I was gonna do vlogs like more than once a week like we're gonna just we're gonna bond during this time quarantine yeah then my mentor got diagnosed with kovat and being hospitalized and then Ryan Madison woke up with a fever and a sore throat and we were worried that she had coded and it's just been a stressful week and I didn't want to just put that all on you guys because you guys have enough going but anyways we're off for a walk it's a beautiful day I'm with the kids Ryan's at work I know some of you guys wanted to know what's going on with Ryan houses days man how have his days been and the truth is he is exhausted he is stressed people at work are worried yeah but I know that a lot of you guys aren't a lot outside so I figured why not bring you on this walk with me so this logs gonna be kind of slow kind of chill but I hope you guys enjoy the nature and if you guys want to go on our walks more often leave a comment down below I've got some videos about food and cooking quick easy healthy meals because you guys know I still want to run that marathon I still have these goals when you know somebody who's going through something so serious as kovat it makes you want to well it makes you want to cry at first but then it really makes you think about your life and what you're putting up and are you living it to the fullest [Music] [Applause] [Music] you'll notice is that nobody's sitting on the benches that's one of the rules that we've been told no sitting on benches just walk breathe and listen to the birds we live outside of Toronto you know all right now we talk a lot about physical health but social isolation is a torture technique for a reason so we thankfully we have oh my gosh you can't see me the great thing about at least my neighborhood is people are keeping that six meters apart its meters its feet people are keeping the six feet apart and like you'll see on this trail if my kids are walking on one side people will like move people move to the other side so that's really nice [Music] [Music] [Music] what have you guys been doing and have you been spending your quarantine time I was spending a lot of time on Netflix at one point cuz we had a lot of rainy weather but that just got old really quickly a lot of people have been telling me to watch Tiger Kings already heard the store back home the kids were exhausted yes score for me which means hopefully they'll go easy on me or that they'll just have meltdowns they just had a snack Gabriel had cereal and mice and a banana fern had a banana I am having lunch and I'm having a sweet kale salad fresh vegetable anyways as I was saying we had already eaten all of our fresh produce so then I started eating a lot of frozen foods and just who doesn't taste the same as when it's fresh so I'm having a sweet kill super seven salad we got this from Costco and it looks like this it's honestly my favorite I know people who don't like salad who like this it comes with this pack it has pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries and then it has a dressing I like to dilute my with olive oil just so that I'm not having as much sugar in my salad and then I'm boiling two eggs to go in there for some added protein do you guys I'm gonna make the perfect boiled egg if you do let me know because I because mine's a guessing game I boiled the water I put the eggs in and then I put them in for ten minutes my friend was saying there's like a six minute on six minute off roll I don't know I like medium boiled eggs like I don't want the yolk running too much [Music] [Music] I'm no chef but it tastes good so yeah sure got some Nigerians do let me know if you guys know this recipe I've mastered it and some rice what you don't like my dreams do what was that what was that what was that it wasn't you Nigerians do is the best right Madison I disown you walking to the French an opening that French you feel me literally on to the next when I tell you and I'm not trying to like toot my own horn but this is as good as my grandmother's yeah all right so this stew is actually vegetarian - the chicken well but all that's missing is oxtail oh that's spicy so just put Jordan down is dinnertime which means I gotta get to cooking I hope one day I have a beautiful kitchen with an island and I can actually learn to like really enjoy cooking cuz to be honest with you guys I hate cooking but I love eating and I told myself in 2020 I'm going to figure out why I hate doing certain things and turn them into my passion so cooking has become kind of like a love-hate relationship I love eating good food but if you want to support me and my goals subscribe help me get 200,000 subscribers I know that this is
