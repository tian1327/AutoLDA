 good morning from South Carolina it is a beautiful day right now it's about 7:30 right now I woke up about half an hour ago there's so many bugs out mehgan's still asleep in the tent but she's probably gonna get up soon I'm just enjoying being down here by the water then we're gonna start our day  all right so we are about to leave South Carolina we're just packed up and we're heading out it turned really overcast because it's meant to rain pretty soon and so we luckily are leaving before the rain starts we don't really have any plan today all we know is we want to go to Savannah Georgia both of our first times in Georgia Savannah's gonna be about two and a half hours from here so it's going to be a quick Drive then we'll stop hang out a little bit and then we're gonna keep on going probably down towards Florida we're trying to hug the coastline but we don't really have a pure destination in Florida yet there's one National Forest that we're debating on going to but it's about ten hours of driving today and that means that we would not get there in the daytime and something unkind and dark as we know is awful so we're gonna see we're gonna hit Savannah first that's pretty much all we have planned hang up there a bit then keep driving down towards Florida and then just kind of wherever we end up around 4 p.m. 5 p.m. we'll start figuring out where we can sleep maybe a motel maybe a campsite we'll find out  we literally just up the campsite maybe three minutes ago and then it's just Darwin for him look at this crazy we had the most perfect timing ever he got in the car and then the little sprinkle started and then we got on for the main road in this now and it's pretty much done two minutes well we just hit some palm tree  so we're about to enter Georgia and my car just went over some roadkill and Justin I was going over it I realized it was an alligator there's just a dead alligator I just saw the tail with all the scales on it so that was pretty crazy so let me just go over a dead road  just got here to Savannah or paying for parking right now  so Savannah is much more like a tiny little town than I expected I thought it was going to be a bigger city there's also a Tuesday so it's really quiet but it's such a sleepy little town right now    we just finished eating and that we're gonna head back to the car it's raining right now but we're gonna run back so originally we had booked a hotel in New Orleans for Friday and Saturday nights but we're gonna get there way faster than we thought so we just changed that Wednesday and Thursday and so we're actually gonna be in New Orleans tomorrow so we got a lot of driving to do Brenda head down to Florida tonight and then spend tomorrow going through Alabama Mississippi and then New Orleans well let's get to the car cause it's raining so as we really in the restaurant the Busboys told me to check out his mixtape on Apple music so that's what we're gonna be listening to you for the next portion of our  we are now in Florida and I just saw an armadillo as roadkill on the side of the road and Meg's got a nice setup here with your pillow and blanket oh yeah that's crazy alligators and armadillos is Road code down here just stop for gas in Florida and Magne got some sodas and they do not play around with the size of these sodas they're huge look at the size of these so look at that's bigger than my head wave it was a dollar fifty working miles from Tallahassee now and we're planning on camping a little south and now announcing Southwest and it is pouring right now and getting really dark it's about 5:30 mrs. Duggar would have a couple more hours of sunlight but this ray and I don't think so this is not ideal camping weather but that's our only plan right now and so we're going to try to count so a pair that out we got there all right so because it does not look like the rain is going to settle any time soon we are going to keep driving find a motel somewhere in which means PA Movado it's only 6:00 so we have a while until we need a like absolutely stop either arrested that tired right now  all right so we are staying at the Days Inn in Florida right on the border of Alabama it cost us about $60 a night so way more than we would have paid in HR Europe but it is a lot bigger than the usual I got definitely not the same value here in America though also it looks like it's gonna rain all night so it's way about isn't sleeping in a tent in the rain here's a quick room tour so we've got a giant bed this nice couch when you first walked in so that's really nice air-conditioning unit right here all right keep on walking and you got a big full-size mirror this TV right here on the beds and a fridge and a microwave and then here's the bathroom a shower toilet all the usual stuff  you
