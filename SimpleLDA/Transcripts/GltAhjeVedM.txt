   good morning everyone and welcome back or welcome to my channel if you're new if you are new here hey what's up my name is Danny I'm not even gonna live so he's a really day outside it is pouring down rain and a day like today I typically would not pick up my camera I actually probably wouldn't get out of bed period it just this weather does not inspire me to be productive whatsoever but last night after checking the weather and seeing that it was gonna be raining all day I figured it would be in my best interest to write down a really detailed to-do list and I don't know just doing something as simple as that really let's a fire under my ass and it encourages me to be at least a little bit productive so I got out of bed this morning at 9:00 and then since then I've just been doing things that are good for me and that make me happy so I figured today would be a good day to vlog because I'm sure a lot of you guys are in the same boat and we're all just looking for little fun things to get our mind off of the bigger not so fun things I definitely don't really start this morning it's just barely 11 o'clock so I'm not in a rush to do anything super productive now that I finished doing my hair for the morning I am probably gonna watch one or two episodes of How I Met Your Mother which will then turn into three or four episodes of How I Met Your Mother well I finished my coffee just want to remind you that all the jewelry that I'm wearing in this video is from aunt Louisa and you guys can check out down below for a link there Mother's Day Sale is still going on so you can use the code in 1/35 for buy one get 35% off  does anyone else also watch Netflix and Hulu with subtitles on or is that just made it's not that anyone asked but I'm still seeing 11:11 and 1:11 every single day so if anyone could tell me what the hell that means I would be very appreciative this show makes my freaking head spin sometimes I'm not kidding so I decided to put on makeup today I figured by watching all my videos it kind of looks like I wear makeup every single day of quarantine and I absolutely do not yesterday I spent all day in that bed I think I had a total of like 90 steps yesterday which is so unhealthy I realized that it's so bad but I was obviously wearing no makeup I was in my sweats and sweat fans and I was content but I definitely feel better on days like today where I make myself feel a little bit more confident and this also just inspires me to get more work done I think so now that my makeups done I'm gonna continue watching how it may your mother because we are at a pivotal point in the plot cannot rest now absolutely not like of all the things that are how much do list right now the lowest priority is probably painting my nails but that's what I'm gonna do right now because it's all I kind of have a new motivation to do  hey brother all right it's 1:30 now a little bit later I just finished eating a little bit of lunch who is texting me huh huh I think I'm gonna give myself another half hour to kind of just screw around and do whatever the hell I want to do I think I'm gonna try and shoot some Instagram content I don't know how that's gonna go but I'll keep you guys updated and then at 2 o'clock I'm gonna go downstairs and work in the kitchen with my mom and just get done hopefully three homework assignments because the semester is wrapping up I definitely have some stuff that I need to get done and I don't want to drag it on into the nighttime because I have things that I want to do tonight that are more fun than school I ended up changing into literally the exact same outfit I was wearing in one of my last videos but it's okay it's quarantine and there are no rolls my door just opened by it so oh my god I hate this my bedroom door just opened all by itself I'm not gonna talk about it I don't want to talk about it we're not gonna speak about it ever again all right shooting that content was actually a really big success I'll show you guys but I have rough edited right now I actually I think this is gonna be what I end up posting because I really like how it looks but who knows everything is subject to change this is what we're working with right now I put it in the app unfold which is one of my Holy Grail photo editing apps because it just makes everything look a little bit cooler and I decided to use two black-and-white photos and two other photos edited in the app teza just I have a video all about how I edit my Instagram pictures if you guys are interested I'll have a link down below but that's just like a quick little overview so now that that's done who knows if I'll post it I guess we'll see you follow me on Instagram if you want to know I have to get some actual work done and when I say that I mean schoolwork so I have quite a few assignments that honestly shouldn't take me too long but are very necessary for me to get done today and I think I have a zoom date with my friends tonight so definitely I don't want to push it off that long I am going to make some brownies because when we got groceries delivered the other day I specifically ordered some baking supplies because it's a very easy quarantine activity and I'm bored so figure why not make some brownies right everyone loves brownies all right guys brownies are in the oven and we have we are having themes night tonight my mom got margarita recipe that she really wants to try and we're gonna order from a local Mexican restaurant we have these fun hats that are not sombreros but they're closing up and yeah we like we then check the menu for the place that we're ordering from and they have family taco night on the menu so we're getting a platter that I think makes like 12 tacos and then we also get two piece of diaz chips salsa hey no no let me stay for tamales I'm so happy I decided to walk today  this is mine thank you  you know I honestly think that the best way to describe quarantine is it's a time with very very high highs and very low lows and tonight was the perfect example a really high high like I just had the best night with my family we've had the best margaritas amazing food I made a whole platter of brownies that I'm now ready to enjoy and I'm about to jump on zoom' with a bunch of my best friends what's up guys and welcome to day two of this vlog I figured I would just extend it I don't really know how much footage I got yesterday for all I know it could be 15 minutes already I really don't think it is but I figured today would be a cool little extension to the vlog for those of you who don't know where I am I don't know it really doesn't even really look like much at this point but I'm at my family summer house out in the Hamptons my family got a summer house last summer or actually around this time last year and I actually filmed the video last summer showing you guys the really beginning stages of the house and I wasn't expecting you guys to love it as much as you did but I mean the feedback I got in that video was amazing so since I'm here today and there's been quite a few changes made I figured it'd be fun to just show you guys what we're doing and how we're furthering progress and kind of just show you a status update on the house so hopefully you guys are into this it's also a beautiful day outside like I haven't been able to comfortably sit outside like this in such a long time so I'm just so grateful for this little change of scenery and to that plane flying above that you guys can probably hear please hold as the weather gets nicer I feel like it's gonna cause me to go a little bit more stir crazy during all of this so I'm just really grateful to have this place to kind of game-2 and I'm just really proud of my parents because they've wanted this for such a long time and they're literally putting their all into it so I'm excited to show you guys all the changes that we've made I feel like my vlogs are never this casual but I'm kind of into it so if you guys want me to just vlog like this more often I'm totally down to do so as long as I have things to talk about so I'm gonna run inside right now I feel like my mom definitely has things that she needs help with so I might as well be useful all right let's just get into the quick little tour shall we I'll have the initial video link down below so you guys can see what the house looked like in its very beginning stages and I think that will help you appreciate a little bit more how far we've come and if you're not interested you guys can just skip forward a few minutes this will only take a little bit so right now we're on the top floor I figured we would just start here first bedroom that you see is my room so I mean the only thing we like painted the walls this was initially purple I'm pretty sure so we got my light up there I have a dresser my closet has been done so then you walk out of my room across the hall you can see the bathroom that my brother and I are gonna share this has been completely redone we have jack-and-jill sinks which is fun so my brother and I don't have to share a sink anymore like we do at home all this stuff I don't know well the basics you guys saw that we have this circle mirror in the hallway that I'm obsessed with I've always wanted a mirror like this in my room so I like the fact that we have one somewhere in the house and then down here we have a bench and this cute little pillow this is going to be my parents room of course to a work in progress but they just got this rug that my mom is very excited about and then they have their bathroom right in here this has also been completely redone I'm pretty sure this was all brown or orange or something like that so it's definitely come a long way then across the hall this is gonna be the office that my dad and I use and then this back here is my brother's room and then as for the bottom floor here's our living room this one again this room has done a complete 180 at this point did a full 180 crazy if you know you know we got these two little rocking chairs my mother's pride and joy about this beautiful couch that we will really never be able to allow be allowed to sit on because it's white and knowing us will make a mess and we have at the fireplace just as it was before didn't we paint this was this always white okay so alright so we painted this we have cute little baskets down there we completely did the dining area and then of course I think my favorite part of the house is the kitchen this thing has definitely come a long way and my beautiful mother and on the right we have our mudroom which was this was just a hallway now and we completely turned it into a mother oh right right right okay so we have our mudroom another bathroom over here I love the tile in this bathroom this is my favorite and then a big mirror this is the door to our basement that is still not done and then we have our family room yet another big couch this one we will be allowed to sit on because it poses a little bit less of a threat we have a TV and then my dad is hammering somebody back there and then there's doors that lead out to the pool so that's a quick little tour for you if you guys want me to keep you updated on some of the other progress that we make in upcoming weeks or months I'd be happy to this is definitely I mean I already said this but this is gonna be a really nice place to just be able to come and escape when the weather gets a little nicer and I'm just so incredibly grateful so I don't know I love taking you guys along in the little endeavors in my life and this is definitely a new development so I wanted to keep you in the loop as best as possible this is like my first outing in such a long time I did a full face makeup sit on actual shoes jeans who the hell am I I'm feeling good  all right guys you literally just got them a little while ago from the Hamptons and there's a really good day I'm so happy I got out of the house and just a nice little change of scenery you can really do it for you and the really beautiful weather definitely didn't hurt but now that I'm home one of my best friends Amanda just wrote in our group chat that she's literally so bored at home that she tried on her senior prom dress and I haven't worn mine since the day of senior prom and since then I have gained 15 pounds thank God so I'm excited to see how this thing feds it's definitely not my style anymore like if I had prom right now I wouldn't wear something like this probably but I'm excited to try it on wearing this dress brings back so many memories like just from that one night it's like good and bad but I don't know weird weird weird  I have a clip with my camera on the same windowsill in the same dress four years ago from the day that's crazy I would love to know if any of you guys have been around long enough to have seen my senior prom blog or my senior graduation blog I've locked both of those things and it's just crazy how it was four years ago I'm feeling so incredibly nostalgic right now but I want to get my parents reaction to my dress so much better and 15 more pounds on me since the last time I wore this dress I just want to say thank you guys so much for watching this video it really doesn't mean the world to me they took the time to watch however long it is and comment down below if you watched to the end the highlight of your week I don't know the highlight of your month tell me something good give me some good news and I'll talk to you guys very soon in my next video
