 alright guys I need to go to the store right now to get my medication as well as some supplies for the house so you got a pretty much put on a mask and some gloves you know it's crazy times are we living in right now so yeah when you're out you know you just need to go out get to what you need and get back home don't try you know go around and start smelling the roses because you might be pushing up daisies you know so yeah let me go get my stuff I do a little bit coin let you guys take a look around but uh it's going to be a very short video as I y'all like I said I just go go get my stuffing and head back home so yeah let's go and get our supplies and I show you what New York looks like during this corona time so let's see you in a bit sorry it's a little shaky as that aim wasn't trying to record so don't bring up my gimbal run anyway you know here's you know streets about my neighborhood and see it's pretty tight that out I mean I ain't never seen you know in this manner especially at 12 o'clock in the afternoon this knows here's some of the restaurants close I mean best friends are allowed to open just for takeout and delivery but some of the restaurants actually decide to just close down and not even open for business but there are some restaurants are open but it is this is East Broadway there used to be la the car is coming up and down this street and I'm like in the middle of street now and not that's empty I mean a lot of the stores are closed I mean the only places are open or pharmacies and and grocery stores in terms of everything else it's pretty much closed you see here that so the store is actually you know they have a choice to open but even that grocery store at that corner decided to close too so it's up to you know up to the storefronts if they want to stay open or not so you see this bus that goes up and down this round and there's like no bus I don't have I haven't seen any bus but there are public transportation I heard that the buses you only allowed to go in through the back and it's free too so you don't have to pay to get on the bus I mean the only people that are allowed to get around or you know essential workers you know people that work in hospitals grocery stores storefronts of some sort you know of course you know transportation workers but yeah it's pretty dead out I mean look at this park I mean usually during this time to be a lot of people sitting in the park at least some kids would be playing but it's it's pretty isolated because like I'm not like in that movie oh that's one person there Oh at least there's one person sitting there yes oh yeah it's pretty up d it's only like oh there's a car FedEx truck of course you know parse door still going on people still getting packages well yeah there's only a few folks out in the streets walking around I'll try to keep distance from each other but yeah this is very unusual especially at 12 o'clock in the afternoon I mean you don't usually see it be dis dead until like after midnight or anything like that so I mean being in New York dis long I have never seen it in this matter see here's a restaurant eyes open but they only do takeout and delivery well you see how now we're on Grand Street heading down to the markets Oh the doughnut plant mmm no it's I'm gonna move for a doughnut it looks like they're closed Oh doughnuts damp anyway he sees this some people pushing around cards it's because now all the supermarkets are not allowed to give out plastic bags and stuff I mean you could get the plastic bags from these supermarkets you just have to pay extra so instead of paying extra everybody just pushed around a cart or carry a grocery bag with them so they could you know go out and buy groceries and bring it home but I said you know it's pretty it's pretty dead out you know there's not a lot of people going around and if all cases if you don't need to go anywhere you know stay home you know it's safer that way and if you need to go out you know try to practice being you know social distance from other folks and in for case if you have masses and gloves weirdos so like this restaurant is closed to one looks like that pharmacy is still open that's good there you go check out Trader Joe's see we could get in today if not you know we go to a little market but there's some police checkpoints on the dick intersection see everybody's bringing carts around that's a lot of people there look at that line forget that I gotta go through the auto market usually no beer is in stock dude it's Corona Oh wherever you got some vitamin C to help fight off look at all this cheese I mean the markers are still pretty stark so you don't have to worry about not getting any groceries or anything positive no we've got a lot of toilet paper so that's good least with the white ball but you
