has like a bunch of like vitamins some protein and everything like you need this is whatever it's kinda a sponge like frozen fruits but I like at the moment if I can't crush throughout the time off of that  and for my milk I usually let go for something like Oh or nut like walnut cashew nut like anything like nut milk base because usually it has like high protein high fat I'm trying to get thick so that's usually what I'm using I discovered this brand ripoff really like their milk something he's not and then I usually like to add orange juice to my smoothies or just like the taste so I do that don't judge me though I have this like the ratchet-ass like orange juice from like the gas station because I ran it or should I have that add blue agave nectar to it to make it sweet   okay all right I'm gonna finish this movie hop in the shower and put a face on so I'll see you in a minute all right just showered shirt on it's not much of a shirt sweat pants something I didn't wash my haircut it's my lazy  today so I'm just going to show you what I do on days I don't shower I love these igk these are little little baby ones this is their first class and the beach club the first class is like a charcoal to talk strife shampoo hi my favorite dry shampoo might absolutely love it it really does work and then beach club is like a volumizing texture spray I like both for different reasons but this one is like really been the best dry shampoo so I just feel like it smells so good I try to go like under my layers and like mainly just the top area and then I just kind of like rub it in  yeah  and then I just like brush it out so it's not so frizzy and like literally my hair looks like I just washed it village I did crazy redhead ratchet ready you can get ready with me yeah and so I'm ready and obviously like this isn't what I do for a photoshoot or like if I really have to get ready or anything but today is just kind of like an errand run kind of like a chill day not really doing much everyone's all in quarantine lockdown anyway so it's not like anybody's going out or doing anything like everybody's losing sweats and masks anyway so yeah I'm gonna take a couple hits and then we're gonna go up to target you have to see the world in quarantine it's actually like really cloudy and dark today which sucks cuz normally I get a lot of light in my apartment like it looks so dark right now in my apartment but normally I usually have like a lot of light now this bog is not the cleanest so please like don't judge me and only hate me in the comments and  but look at this falling it's so pretty a friend of mine giftedness actually maybe it's so cute I love the pink top right there and the ball juice pink as well definitely dirty I'm sorry and the down stem is black which is cool and then it has like this see it's like a mandala shape underneath it's so pretty like even when you see it up top like always and it has like a shape like like a weird song kind of shape it's not a song bum though but it is like a cult different shape so I love that like I would my new favorite pieces I am smoking on I have some three seed farms right here this is a Jack crackin and then this is Black Lotus this one's more of an indica this one's more of a Steve obviously with the Jack I'm personally I am actually I told them this I'm not a big hick sativa fan just because it gets me really racy and we're talking is in a hurry am how I normally stay away from sativas if it's like a good jack I usually like those like a Jack Herer strawberry like strawberry caution or a banana anything like that and I'm not gonna like this is probably I wish you could smell it like it doesn't look like much I just cover up my face for the camera to zoom into the focus on it it'll work hello hopefully a long time in focus you know I got the bowl cheers guys if you guys have something packed as well I only smoked half that bull and I'm already pretty good I hate what this happens to when I have like somewhere to go or like something to do because then I'm always like oh do I really need to do it you know or whatever  see like I don't know why I do that I just like baby baby it's like I don't know I think all right we are now on our way to target crash like breaking down too suggesting this is my car I don't think I've seen it yet it is a yellow cyst LVO SUV I love the red interior it's hard to look my directions whoa this is crazy it's kind of creepy guys it's like the entire parking lot is all empty all right so it's like empty so don't feel weird blog anymore got some hand sanitizer so I was like talking the whole car right here and then I looked down at my camera realize I'm not recording any of that so that's awkward but basically I was just saying like I'm super nervous to like film and public actually like I've never really done that before but myself too so like I'm gonna target with like a full-on camera like filling myself it's a little weird so I don't know if I'm gonna do it or not I think I'm gonna especially like a mask and everything's for the outside world my gloves on I had like a prettier mess when I posted on Instagram with but honestly I don't know what the  happened to that mask so I just lost it but yes also I don't know what the  just happened but literally a little right as I'm filming right now like five six cars just pulled up right now they're all parked around me so now it's awkward so I'm going to say bye  Wow okay that was a fail hands out target is closed today I don't know if it's because it's like Easter Sunday or cuz the corona thing but great I am out now oh  I don't know is it illegal to vlog and drive so I guess we're gonna try one more target that's like down this tree I don't know why I'm like so obsessive target like I swear this isn't like sponsored by Target imagine it's so hard to type with blocks oh my god we're gonna get to do this we're gonna get it this way there's a sensor right here I came passing by cops and I swear I'm about to be pulled over and they're gonna be like you can't vlog and drive  like that's illegal okay cool 99-cent store is open so we're gonna try this spot next like honestly I'll be so happy if I could just get like bunny ears at this point that's all I really need just to get my little Instagram post up it's already like 1:13 so take a minute but I might get home and put the bunny ears on put an outfit on take the photo edit it post it up it's probably gonna be like 4 o'clock so there goes my whole day I'm just so pissed target was closed like whatever I mean I'm completely understanding okay cool looks like this place is a little packed but that's better than nothing see I knew an empty parking lot was a bad sign like there's no way even in apocalypse it's gonna be that empty alright cool I got a spot real quick so I guess we're gonna go in my name sense or instead  I think I'm gonna get we get these all right we are home a little bag stop first foremost wash my hands so happy I got the bunny ears like I look like I'm just going to show you what I got how much little bunny ears I love that it's like a salmon pink super cute it came
