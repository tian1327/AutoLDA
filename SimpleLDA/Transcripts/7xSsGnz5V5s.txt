 hi so I left New York City and I'm in one of the outer boroughs at my mom's with my two brothers my mom my stepfather and the bull mastiff both his name is bull I left about a week ago I think seven days ago I have one suitcase some books and my guitar I'm good for right now New York was getting pretty out of control and I don't think people were understanding how serious everything was getting and how rapidly things are moving with this ridiculous terrible virus it was just it was the smart thing to do to get out of the city I'm not very far away from the city I'm far enough to where I'm not in the middle of a hot zone when I was in the city a week ago I was going out minimally was going out maybe once a day there are people in my neighborhood that just weren't taking proper precautions and it was starting to really freak me out I was super cautious and barely breathing outside and whatever I brought home I immediately washed immediately washed myself there is a tension growing I think New York has curfew it's not enforced by law but they think by 8 p.m. everyone should be inside and if you need to get something you need to go to the grocery store or the pharmacy you can go out and do that but very minimal couple of my friends are sick with Corona I had a childhood friend who just passed away today he was on a respirator all my love goes out to him this family I was an absolute shock when I heard that and it's it's scary it is scary so I left and it came here there are pretty trees outside I'm not in my apartment anymore I am in a house but the house has a lot of people in it and we're all here together so we're all trying to do our part we're all trying to stay calm stay occupied it's been weird it's been weird it's just creepy and weird and I don't know how else to describe this my sister is a nurse she's been on the frontlines of this she's been quarantined herself in her apartment right down the street from my mom's house I've been visiting her through her balcony but it's it's been stressful and we're losing track of days we're losing we're losing our minds a little bit but then we have to regroup and keep occupied so we're all we're all just trying to keep our heads together here and stay busy and staying busy right now it sounds like a chore but that's all we can do stay busy get creative I don't want it to make a video in a week because I've been so confused and uninspired not feeling inspired but we have to keep on keeping on and continue our connection with each other it's so important it's so important to keep connections open so that's why I'm doing this video now and it's a bit of an update I I'm about six miles from New York City that's where my mom lives but it's very far removed this is just to say hey how you guys doing how's everyone doing out there I've been I've been listening to a lot of music just turning the music up and tuning stuff out really it's kind of been my salvation the past couple of days and and texting a lot of friends back and forth a lot of FaceTime calls with friends and family it's easy to start spiraling and feeling bad so we're not going to do that we're going to continue to breathe continue to push forward and make the best of this very strange situation and it's an opportunity to be with your family your friends your loved ones it's an opportunity to be with the people that you love the people that's that's most important to you this type of situation probably won't happen again hopefully won't happen again in under these circumstances but looking on the bright side it's a good opportunity to see more the time with your family even though the two of you crazy everyone's getting a little snappy it's fine people are gonna feel weird and then just let the weirdness go and then feel okay again we're getting through we're doing everything we can I've really been trying not to watch the news I've mainly been listening to what our governor has to say Governor Cuomo for updates on New York and the other boroughs and the surrounding states it seems as though we're gonna have two more weeks of this we may just have two more weeks of quarantine we're gonna find that out very soon actually we'll be finding that out in a matter of hours I'll let you know what happens with that and I'm going to keep making videos making these videos is the only thing that is keeping me semi seen I've realized it once they start making these once I start on a topic or I start talking and I start researching a topic or just connecting it's keeping me grounded and I know people are online looking for content good content happy content there are some fantastic tic TOCs out there I've recently been scrolling tic toc so yeah looking for happy good content feel-good content what I find what I find a little bizarre in a good way is that hallmark is playing Christmas movies now I don't even know what day it is well I do it's Saturday we just found that out they'd either gonna bleeding into each other they're bleeding into each other but Hallmark is playing Christmas movies and we are all so disoriented and it's the beginning of spring and I'm watching Christmas movies quarantined it makes no sense but uh yeah so that's the update I hope you guys are doing well I hope everyone's hanging in there keeping busy trying to stay calm and cool and that's all take a deep breath yeah it's gonna be okay I'll keep you updated on what's happening alliant so for now hi and I hope everyone's doing well and I will see you on here very soon okay
