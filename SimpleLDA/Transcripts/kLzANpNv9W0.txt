off I don't know why so you can hear that I sincerely apologize I do have to do things for work but that's not gonna take much time I do have to a shower and get myself ready for the week I guess my legs are like so hairy that they hurt I also need a self-tan or I want soft and I don't need to but I want to just to make myself feel a little bit better but actually I don't even know if I have any self-tanner left that's gonna be a problem my only adventure out of the house the past two and a half weeks has been Starbucks I'm going to Starbucks a lot because it's my little adventure for the day
