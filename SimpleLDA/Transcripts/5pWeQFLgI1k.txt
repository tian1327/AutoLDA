 disclaimer I've heard from one unit scooper the YouTube was taking down videos they said the word so I'm not gonna say it okay it is the pandemic oh come on it is the bug the virus it's just not gonna be the whole name if I remember I'm still a chef currently in New York I'm with a company that's contracted to FEMA so we are contracted to work 14 to 21 days straight I made all the city hospitals pretty much so I've been here since Friday before last we did not worry quite a Saturday Monday day we didn't work for like four or five days and now we have been working at least eight hours since Wednesday so once an Thursday I worked eight hour days for like orientation type stuff Friday Saturday Sunday and Sunday I've worked 12-hour shifts on the floor so first of all this the start their days child I have my night shift at throwing through okay just a life it's not for your girl okay because I am tired I'm tired when I wake up I'm trying to wake up they're early I just been going to sleep at that time with this that's not for me I love them I'm here I'm here so you really just take whatever you keep okay luckily I was um placed on the ape-men delivery because some people are not being placed in their specialties because the need is not great enough that I'm supposed to do so luckily I am placed there and that comes with this own set of challenges and advantages but right now I just thought like maybe people would actually care about this know what's really going on out here I will say that it's crazy as people say it is well by the time you see this it might be as crazy as people said it was I don't know we'll see and it's probably even worse than what you can imagine the stories stories job let's start with today's Jambo so this is day I keep I'm losing track of days okay so if I make up some dates I'm sorry I lied it is I just looked it is Monday March 30th okay so today we have been working for Sunday I just did this map so as you can say the plan is to work 14 21 days straight so technically because I got here I was supposed to start work last Saturday not this past I've been Saturday before that I've already knocked out nine days now so at least not I report to you today are done however I can't decide to stay longer will I the world may never know I haven't really been posting a whole lot of videos and pictures and stuff of me because I look like this I mean I'm cute or whatever but now right now I look like like this stuff is tired and I'm gonna explore this night as demanding due to though um as other people like this is not a mid search and I see you owe for dedicated so that this is just labor and delivery you know it luckily while there have been several positive patients luckily I am in exactly where I want to be it is not as crazy as the rest of the world because the rest of the world is crazy while my uni may not be crazy just this whole experience even although this like date non of whatever has been crazy hearing other people's stories hearing the complaints from other people at simulated like at least 30 or 45 minutes for some people to come back on the bus they transport us on buses like Greyhound buses whatever we waited 30 or 45 minutes for people to come back on the bus because the night shift was refusing to take patients because they didn't have proper feet PPE our discuss where I should probably be sleeping but whatever um so yeah they they were refusing so they have meant that the people who owned a ship who was supposed to go by gonna sail with us riding a bus wouldn't lead nothing wrong I completely understand because who wants so so my patient you came to own the room did you know what a wrong thing station that you do were positive you know without probably be cool anyway so that would be more more stories like that more experiences like that I'll get in some more detail about the whole labor and delivery style when I personally seen what people I've met on this assignment have told me their experiences some of them just about Vito okay I'm just gonna just get it I probably shouldn't get me but should I just tell you some of what I've witnessed first and second hand okay oh    the fattest child effect first of all I'm sooo nervous because I don't wear him to work all right so um today honestly wasn't really that bad I wasn't as tired I thought I was gonna be I think us because it was pretty outside which sounds crazy but it's true but I one of the girls that I work with that I I talk to live all day and work she was sick today so she has several common symptoms or whatnot so she didn't come to work this is actually the second person home there those are the same hospital I con the ride the same bus every day was an orientation together yes I think it's scary like and it's not necessarily get it they're so scared so I mean probably all happy it's just like not new on whether or not you have and not know I have to be it's gonna be for you because they really legit could be anywhere from oh you got these cold symptoms to UDA like there is no in-between and that's that's scary we do get pregnant moms who also test positive obviously because they people so there's Stan okay oh but we're starting to get more and just like I said I thought that party said this before I might have cut it out though I don't know but a lot of the pregnant patients that we did we don't start doing all the extra precaution like counting up every single time you go in and put on a face shield and goggles in in ninety five minutes and America on top of that you know we don't in two or three pairs of gloves I don't do that for every single patient unless they're suspected but a lot of them are coming back positive after they deliver they start showing symptoms afterwards in a test that outdoor thing they don't think 20 hundred million thousand billion true medical professionals before that you know you ain't just like popular positive it started now it worked okay but in daylight today we got a patient who was like imminent delivery like so she's coming in pushing in crap and well she's positive which I mean obviously it happens but like you want to be like limo kiss just make me let me go make sure but no I got a front gal and a mask and another man and some gloves and wear my goggles in you know you'll just carry on this time run your pockets because first of all he scrubs from small but these pockets monsoon okay we're not doing it like this so you know it takes more time to do that and it's just like a mom and a baby like they live you know like anyway however in this instance just like that I've noticed so I kind of talked about today New York has so many different like policies this hospital cause it could to be this hospital if I'm gonna think it's just the whole state long don't crucify me if it's not cuz I'm looking it up cuz I don't care I don't know whatever this hospital do because oh really what they don't do because that's what I meant they don't do like vaginal exams ever at all under no circumstances what well I'm like this gripping to pop out a baby this residents quick just residents questioning me too much like she died move how about I could have put a check title no no but no that's not how it works to residents to everything attendance autumn knows a teaching hospital nestled thickness I talk with my hands a lot I'm sorry but that was that was a thing and there was still short on PPE and that's another problem like because we're so short and I don't know why that's cuz you're just like the main or any labor delivery so are where so much stuff because there no are some people come to make them delivery taking stuff like I mean I get it you don't have it when you take it from us than you will have it and when you keep coming to take you from us they start like a stuff up so my patient coming in about to deliver I kind of go get a locking key literally literally a freakin lock and key like the key is in the Pyxis like that's how serious this isn't I'm laughing but I'm serious like the key is in the Pyxis we don't want pictures in the pictures is where the all the medicine is kept so you have to like log in with a password badge into the room like that's how get the key unlock the key out the safe like that's how serious people are about this PPE like in 95 minutes that's where you will find them gowns that's where you will find them and that's crazy that's so crazy totally I thought I'd get so far away today Oh blog for like I could just look talking log for this long so I'm not sure if I'm repeating dance international oh okay run my thumb still oh so Saturday will make 14 days it'll make I think of my content the day working in a room will see how both of those go and we're gonna try the recess Saturday to see if we're gonna stay one more week cuz after 21 days the bag has died me and I'm gonna leave before colvett get you two okay in Jesus name in Jesus name because  my anxiety got me short of breath and I'd be trying to like remember like breathe he says you it's not cold you hashtag 20/20 it's not called the issue breathe so today um actually yesterday we got a patient but I finally told y'all that was actually positive who delivered okay cool whether she came in like ready to deliver and nobody came in her room said oh the nurse I'm in triage by the way nobody came in to help the nurse who was taking a patient from me and other trash nurse so you know the triage nurse helped now if I had not been in these labor rooms at all I only been injured so I have not been in labor rooms I don't know why anything he is and nobody came to help because the patient was positive today I had a patient who then had both cool babies okay now first rodeo and she's in labor and I'm sorry you know I supposed to do throw outside up to the room they don't want her because her own is not set up we'll set it up oh yes you sorry the important part she's a suspected code of a patient so it's impossible um but it's a third time setting up the room because they were waiting on the filter so I helped the filter anyway whatever it makes a regular room a negative pressure room which helps with airborne particles and data to drive souther no matter anyway those are the rooms that we put the patients who are suspected positive whatever put them in well they didn't want us in reporting his expected patient so they got it you know the lady said she had none of these symptoms and then in the middle of talking to her asking her a question she started coughing then I actually had a cough you ain't trying nothing the last two minutes the last two seconds which is what you call force is my collaborator squared like what you lying it for what is that for anyway she's in a regular room it would I have any more filters so I've been here with her with no filter I mean I'm gallon up in our little stuff but I don't feel so when I'm doing her but you feel like in order for you to put her into labor on the patient that had beaucoup babies who is already advanced the dog cannot advance so that's a bit extremist ally way no way she dilated she's in labor and you only burn the room they got a baby warmer and stuff for delivery she was leaving a trace room that has nothing probably literally nothing but a stretcher and some monitors that busy but you'll be frame there because you'll have a filter people are really not trying to do with these patients and that's annoying especially you have all the proper stuff don't get me wrong if you don't give me no proper be see you Scott deliver your own baby I'm sorry sorry I'm just playing just dad nurses go I'm playing anyway anyway that's annoying having some people don't do with these faces I not the patient personally but I don't want to deal with no coal pit either like it's not just you drink all over the family you rent all the wounds I go back home we got to make it back home cuz you got kids to feed I'll have no kids but my point is you ain't only one I ain't one of y'all but you ain't the only one okay like you you know but they be acting like it that Debbie you didn't make me look mad because what happened sweet on the knees yeah we know we're not in this together tune back in for part 2 to see how the rest of my 21 day stretch went
