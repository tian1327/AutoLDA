 Hi, I’m Sarah, a New York City YouTuber
and today I’m guest vlogging on EF’s channel to show you where to get that
perfect Instagramable photo. As an Instagramer myself, I’m always
looking to get that perfect shot. So, today, I’m going to show
you where you need to go, the tips to get that iconic shot,
and what photography you need to use. Let’s just get into it.
Number 1: We’re going to start with the tips, okay? Any time you’re trying to get that perfect
Instagram photo, shoot during “golden hour.” “Golden hour” is a photography term used to
describe when the light is absolutely perfect. You get that beautiful, golden light.
This happens during sunset and sunrise. Number 2:  Wherever you’re going to take your photo  - and I’m going to show you the top
5 places, in my opinion, to take it - you should choose a color that
will pop against that background. So, if the background is predominantly white,
maybe wear red or green or blue. If the background is brick, red isn’t the best color choice there,
so choose a color that works best for the particular scene that you
will be shooting the photo in. And number 3: Although it is great to have that perfect camera
- that very expensive photographer camera - you really don’t need it.  Today, you can just use your phone.
The phone has an amazing camera. I generally use Snapseed and Facetune to
edit my photos if I take them on the phone and it works really well. Alright. Let’s get into the best locations
for Instagram photos in New York. There are a lot of them,
so it was very hard to choose. I have a whole video on my YouTube
channel about even more locations, so, if you want to go over there and
watch it, it will give you more ideas. All of the places I’m going to mention
will be linked below in the vlog post to show you exactly where they are. You can just bring that map with you and it
will make it way easier to capture these photos. Number 1:  Grand Central.
If you’re coming on the train from the EF campus in Tarrytown,
this will be your first stop in the city. And, conveniently, this is also an
amazing Instragram photo location. Grand Central is an icon of New York and I recommend, if you want to
get that perfect shot here …. It tends to be very crowded,
so what you need to do is go up on the stairs where the Apple store is and 
capture the shot overlooking the whole station. Or, if you’re able to schedule your
photo shoot in the evening, you’re actually going to have
the best photo options here. Grand Central is really busy, especially
in the morning and during rush hour. You’re going to want to plan your
visit to Grand Central, ideally, if you can arrange it, after 10pm. Now, I know you’re probably
thinking, that’s crazy, Sarah! Why would I schedule a photo shoot then?
Well, if you really want that perfect shot, that’s the time you have to go to Grand Central 
and that way you’ll get less people. One thing to keep in mind at Grand Central:
Do not bring a tripod. They will kick you out. I learned the hard way. Don’t make the mistake.
Just have a friend capture that photo for you. Number 2:  Dumbo. Dumbo, Brooklyn, is hands down
my favorite location to shoot. There are two locations in particular
that you should focus on. Number 1 is Pebble Beach. Pebble Beach overlooks the
Manhattan skyline and Brooklyn Bridge. If you can get there at sunrise, it is so stunning.
The colors will blow you away. I recommend wearing yellow or something that
really pops here because the city is kind of gray. So, bringing in a bright color that pops will
make this photo stunningly gorgeous. Another wonderful spot here is Washington Street. Washington Street has that iconic
view of the Manhattan Bridge. You need to get here early as well
because everyone comes here for a photo. I think, besides Times Square,
this is probably the spot that more people come than anywhere
else to get that perfect Instagram shot. If you have a camera that has
low lighting capabilities, you can actually come here at night and
there’s almost no one here at all. And if you can capture all the beautiful light
the city brings in with a low-lighting camera, the photo looks phenomenal at night as well. Number 3:  Central Park.
Central Park is the most filmed location on earth. More movies have been shot in Central Park
than in any other location in the world. Can you believe it? Well, it’s no wonder that many people want
to come here to get their photo taken. There are many spots here. There’s Belvedere Castle, 
and there are several rocks that you can sit on. It’s very difficult to explain to you how to
get to these locations and where they are, so I have a map link below that will
show you exactly where they are. The great thing about Central Park is that
it’s not as crowded as the other locations I’ve mentioned because it’s much
larger and people spread out. So, you don’t actually need to
go there early in the morning. You can go there midday and
still get that perfect shot. The Flatiron Building is another
classic, New York building and this is a great shot to get that
New York City bustling vibe. I recommend wearing something
very street-style if you can. One of the things I always try to capture when
I’m shooting on the street, is a taxi passing by.  Look out for that moment,
and be careful, of course - you’re not going to step 
in front of a taxi cab - but position yourself so that you capture the building and
the taxi cab crossing at that exact moment. Sometimes this takes a little patience. You have to wait for the moment to happen exactly
right, but that’s what photography is all about. Just take as many photos as you can and
the more options you have, the better. Number 5:  The Brooklyn Bridge. What would the Manhattan skyline look
like without the Brooklyn Bridge? It just wouldn’t be complete.
The bridge has been there since 1883 and it’s been a photo spot ever
since photography existed. Honestly! To get that perfect shot at the
Brooklyn Bridge, you have to arrive early. I know you hate me for saying to arrive early, but that’s part of getting that
perfect Instagram shot. I wouldn’t recommend
getting there later than 8am because it gets very crowded,
especially in the summer. If you are here during spring, summer or fall, make sure you get there even
earlier than 8am to get that shot. It’s not very colorful, so
wearing a color that pops here, like red, blue, or yellow, 
really looks beautiful. The one thing you’ve got to look out for
are bikers as you’re taking these photos. They can get very annoyed at
you if you’re standing in the way, so just be aware of that as 
you’re taking your shot. Those are my top Instagram
photo locations in New York. For even more information on visiting this

and thank you for watching. Bye!
