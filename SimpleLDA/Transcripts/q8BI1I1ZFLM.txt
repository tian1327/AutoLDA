 hi guys it's Stacey from close LaVon and we are doing a thrift haul I'm so excited so it was 11 weeks to the day from the last time I thrifted if you aren't aware I live in Illinois which is starting to open up Chicago specifically which is where I live is on a little bit of a delay from the rest of the state but certain places are opening up so on Friday I went to two stores that were offering private shopping they're much smaller stores so they just aren't having it so people just come in and shop like normal which like when our Salvation Army's open up that's how it's gonna be and if they're beyond capacity there will be a line outside the store so this sounded like a lot safer way to shop to me also you know I can guarantee that it was just gonna be me and my husband and the store besides the employees that they weren't gonna be people like within that six feet of me and so I was really game to shock like this and as you can see I ended up getting a lot of stuff so I was really excited so this is one consignment store one thrift store I'm not going to disclose locations just because I need these resources especially right now after it's been a rough 11 weeks trying to get inventory and have it be pieces up to my standards which really I haven't had a lot of inventory up to my standards but I'm thankful that I was able to make it work over the last few weeks with donation pickups and doing some online sourcing but this is my comfort zone this is what makes me happy and I'm so happy to be back doing it hopefully your states are in the process of opening too and you can go back to thrifting so let's jump into it and I'll show you guys what I got I got so much um there's a lot a lot of Lululemon in here but we're gonna start off with the shoes which are in this bag I only got three pairs of shoes okay first pair is definitely a little more worn in but they were a good price so these are Tory Burch flats and this is a very popular style flat from them they are authentic they have the leather sole and everything they are the cute little snakeskin prints so these are a size 8 I'm gonna try to remember to do size in case you guys are interested in anything I am gonna try and get this stuff up as quickly as possible but if there's anything you're interested in purchasing that you aren't seeing in my Poshmark closet just leave a comment down below saying that you're interested and I will let you know when I have it available and I will make it a priority to get that item listed ok next shoes our Vince Vince little slip on sneaker type things they are this really pretty like gunmetal silver kind of color and then these shoes are also a size 8 and then this is the last pair of shoes that I bought these are rag-and-bone booties so they have like the zippers on the inside they have suede in the back and then a leather in the front and these are a size 36 so like five and a half to a six depending on what the rag-and-bone shoe conversion is I'd have to look that up but these are so cute I love them so had to pick those up okay so the clothing I got from that first store first thing I grabbed is a made well little striped t-shirt definitely not something that's gonna go for a ton of money this is a size small but since I did the name your price sale I completely sold out of made well and actually Lululemon so it was nice to add some and this is from fall 2018 so it is a little more recent next super cute I love this piece so this is Kate Spade again it's a say small but it has the nice like scalloped sleeves and it has the grommet detailing on it and then on the neckline also I'm now seeing since I'm in a better lighting that there is a little bit of like makeup on the color I will see if I can remove that or I'll just note it in the listing though and price it a little lower but so pretty and then last thing from the first store was this Lululemon tank top which I've sold this style before and then this is a size 6 I will say there's because I have small flaws I didn't check for flaws very well at the second story I went to because I had a much shorter shopping time slot and you had to be out by the time your time slot was over because they had someone else scheduled behind you so I focused more on finding stuff and less on looking it over for flaws which normally I would want to do both if I go back to the store I'm gonna try and book a double time slot so I can shop longer okay so first thing from Nats store though is a Lululemon tank pretty beautiful pink I actually passed on a lot of Lululemon from the store they just had so much so I looks a lot of pricing and then I tried to pick pieces that would have a size dot particularly so this one is a size 4 and tank tops from Lululemon don't go for a lot like typically I can expect about 15 to maybe 25 kind of more in the 15 to 20 so I was factored out for what the stores asking but in this particular sourcing trip I also had to factor that I'm trying to get my closet back to where it was pre quarantine and that there I'd rather have a bunch of Lululemon and get my closet back up to a standard where you can expect to find things like Lululemon and made well versus right now I feel like there's a lot like more of gap and Old Navy that I don't normally carry in my store so I feel like I had to factor things that I don't normally factor when I'm thrifting just because it's been 11 weeks alright so another Lululemon tank top this one is a size 10 and I can already see that this does have a stain on the inside like I said I didn't really get to check it over for flaws but any flaws I find I will just note and price accordingly alright another loulou and this is a really traditional style where it's got the built-in bra and then the tank kind of lays a little lower again not something I can expect a ton of money for but it is a popular style and this one is a size 8 and I just use you Lulu fan to find all the style names so I don't know a lot of these style names off the top of my head but I will look them up before listing all right more Lulu another pink one and then this one I actually can't find a science dot on it so I will measure for size and I will particularly compare it to the other pink one because I think they are the same style all right but there's gonna be a ton of Lulu tanks I kind of bunched them all together so we have another one here and this one has the built-in bra it's very strappy and then the low back tank to it and then this one is a size four if you ever wondering you can find the size dots and the left little like bra cup insert that's where it's going to be for tank tops and if it doesn't have it there then it means there isn't a science of diet unless you have the ripoff tag still alright another tank I've actually sold this one in this color before and this one is a size eight I'm telling you guys I hit the Lulu jackpot this is one I did pick up without excise thought because I think I'd sold this one before and it sold for actually a lot of money I think it's a little more rare and the back is really cute it's kind of got that like fold-over detailing so I do have to measure it for size but looking at it I would say it's probably like an eight or a ten and here is another no size dot one really pretty blue and it's got some like mesh detailing on the shoulders and on the back I love this one I haven't seen anything like this with a floral print at the top before from Lululemon so I was excited to find that and then this one is a size 4 alright here is another Lulu tank with the built-in bra I'm not sure I actually have it on the hanger correctly right now and this one is a size 2  okay another one this one like the front lays and then there's the built-in bra that you can see there and then it's in the back also super cute I love I love what I found because I haven't had I'm purchase a Lululemon in a long time this one's a size eight I mean I did get some Lululemon from thredUP but I couldn't grab basics cuz they're too expensive on there um this tank top is like a criss cross back pretty grey I'm pretty sure I've sold either this tank or just this colorway of a different style tank but I've definitely sold something like this before alright this is another one where I'm gonna have to measure it for size  alright I think this is the beach scape print I know if you find the beach scape wonder under leggings those are very rare I don't think this one is as rare but I do know that I believe that's the print name and then this tank is a size six and it's got a really pretty back to it next is a holter tank top with a strappy back I've definitely sold this style tank before in a different colorway and this one is a size eight alright next we're on to Lulu bras because they're sports bras also do really well for me so this is just a little Y back one with some mesh on the back and then this is a size 10 which is a lot harder to find in Lululemon so I think that should do well next bra and then this bra size 4  all right I think this is a bikini top from Lululemon but I make sure but it has like a little metal clasp in the front and the lighting does seem more like a swimwear lining and I do know that Lululemon sells swimwear and this one's different as the logo on the front I don't immediately see the size on this one either but I will figure that out all right next to similar to that first bra with a little mesh back and then this one is also a size 10 probably my favorite color scheme of the Lulu brows that we've seen and it's got the really pretty strappy back to it and this is a size 4 alright this one is just a crisscross back bra and then this is a size 4 so we got a lot of size 4 and bras going on another really pretty more unique one with a super strappy back to it and then this one's a size 10 alright and then the last bra it's just a white bra with the black and white print and then this one is a size 4 this one actually has the cups and I need to make sure that especially for the tanks and bras I'm gonna try and list if it comes with the removable cups or not I get asked that a lot it doesn't typically like deter people from buying one way or the other because I've heard that you can just go into Lululemon and ask them for the removable cups and they'll give them to you for free I haven't ever tried it but I just get asked it a lot with my Lululemon tanks and bras so I need to start putting it in the description ok next is a theory tank top I don't grab a ton of theory but this was so pretty I love the floral print and a little Thai detail perfect for spring and summer this was a more recent j.crew piece I don't grab a whole lot of j.crew I the pineapple embroidery and this was a 20-18 piece all right we have another Lululemon I have definitely sold this piece in this color before and this is not one that has a size thought so I will just measure it all right I debated on grabbing this Lululemon piece because it's not a skirt that I think it's super popular but I do believe that plaid Lululemon sells a little better so I decided to try it out this one has the RIP tag and it is a size two alright next we got some Lululemon shorts and these are H size six they have a really pretty floral print to them another pair of Lululemon shorts these are a solid black what should do really well because people love black bottoms to like exercise in so these are a size eight I think they're the speed short based on the back but I will again look them up on Lulu fanatics okay made well these are button fly shorts a size 27 nice little bra hem to them and I need more shorts in my closet so that's great these are Levi's cutoff shorts the 501 and these are a size 25 alright my last pair of shorts here these are also made well they have just a zipper and then the raw hem to them and these ones are a size 27 alright moving on to some Lulu's crepes and leggings so these are crop and they have a pattern to them I am really bad with the bottoms names because I think a lot of the bottom styles look the same so I will try and find these based on the print so these are a size 6 alright next these are aligns I would have to measure the inseam because they come in a bunch of different inseams and these are size four there are six they would definitely be mine I live in align leggings so yeah these are like an olive green I actually think I have this color in my personal wardrobe so it shouldn't be too hard to figure it out these are a little flawed where they have like discoloration at the top but aligns are very sought-after alright next I'm gonna assume that these are a wonder under but I could be wrong and then these are a size four and again I have to figure out like what the inseam is to know if they're like full length or 7/8 or whatever alright this is a really cool print to it and I don't immediately see a size dot I'll look at it better later otherwise I will measure it for size alright another pair and these are like brushed at the bottom and these are a size two and then I dunno this one these are a dance studio pants and then these are a size 10 I love selling the dance studio it's a very popular style from Lulu okay next we have just a couple pairs of jeans these are free people gray jeans size 29 with the open knees and then we have a similar style from Free People these are like a light wash again with open knees and then this is a science 27 I don't typically pick up a lot of target collabs this is a Lilly Pulitzer for Target club though and I have had luck with this collab in the past so this is a jumpsuit from them alright now we are on to just three more jackets and they aren't Lululemon all of them so this one has a cool little like open in the back on the hood has the logo I haven't been able to find a slice that on this so I'm gonna measure it for size okay next I love this jacket it's like a almost rain jacket kind of windbreaker jackets this is I believe the piece I paid the most for out of everything but I loved it it's a size 8 and just based on the print I am assuming it's a little more rare or can go for more money but I won't know until you look up comps all right and last is either the scuba or the remix this might be the remix actually they're very similar in style but they are different jackets and then this is a size 4 and it does have the logo on the hoodie there that's everything that I picked up my first day of back to sourcing and stores I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please give a thumbs up I'm hoping to get some more haul videos up for your lives before I move and I'm on like another thrift band for a few weeks there hopefully that doesn't last too long especially because with kovat I know that in general they're saying that it might have like a research in like the fall winter so I worry about us going back into quarantine in the future so I'd like to try and like keep up with thrifting in case it gets taken away from us again and obviously I've learned that I can survive that but I'd rather script while I can but we'll deal with that if we have to so thank you guys so much for watching this video if you liked it please give it a thumbs up and I will talk to you guys later bye
