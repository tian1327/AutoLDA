 that's my channel so far today's video it's going to be a date in the life of a quarantine vlog and while I'm on this today I just want to take a quick minute to update you guys as to why I haven't been active on my Instagram on my youtube and I broke Python about a week half ago just as I was due to upload my next video from my last one surprise my sister I'm just waiting for my new ones be delivered but obviously because of the cove in 19 don't know how long it's gonna take so I actually went over to my family members house and I'm just boring an old phone that they're not no longer using so I'm just using that to make somewhat of hopefully a good video just so I can get something out for you guys until my my new phone comes so I said in this video I'm just going to be doing what I'd usually do while we've been in quarantine just keep myself busy and things like that and so I got off around half past 8 and now it's 10 o'clock I've just been doing the jobs downstairs but I think that you guys have been seeing that just like general Howes job so now I'm just going to tag in my room and then I'm gonna get into my gym stuff and do a workout so I will put you on a time-lapse for that I haven't done one yet and as I'm not doing that motivated so hopefully I'll get some motivation back and we'll do a workout hopefully this one's still shining outside so that will keep me a little bit more motivated so I'll put your time while I'm doing my workout and hide in my room and then I'll keep you updated with anything else that I do today so without further ado let's get on with the video  I just work out and now I'm just gonna get in the shower I'm boiling it hot and I didn't do it along with it just cuz I hit my own clothes and I walked into it but I haven't been able to walk for last week so I just take a nice and easy did some things outside and they came inside to do my our captors cooked really well outside so I'll tell you what products and room use them I have in the shower and then sew them using that knowing I love vanilla shampoo but this is just well my bond just so it's not you know I just turned out and the brighteners in it and the long hair intense my strands in hair mask so I have working with these I have I just can't code which I believe it down in the description box below if you guys want to go and check this out it is amazing I love it so much and I've seen such difference in my hair so I'll show you when I got out the towel  as you can see I'm now dressed laughter just on my hair and some minimal make-up just cuz I'm taking my sister to her work just for her training car so I just wanted to talk you through a few products that I've been living at the minute and some new ones and some old favorite ones so an old favorite is the revolution supersize conceal and define concealer this is a full-coverage concealer I could I did get the super sized one and I get this in the lightest shade the see one and just because I like to highlight under my eyes and in it and stand out really well so I picked this off and also I picked up off Beauty the ultimate high spreadability fluid primer this is absolutely gorgeous it feels so like sheen on your face and it pairs really well with this new foundation I've got this is the Arden we want as well this is the high coverage foundation and I got this in light medium and this just cause it's got yellow undertones with gold highlight so that's what foundation I tend to get so these three paired together work really really well and that's what I'm wearing now and then for my lip combo because let's people keep asking me about this I use the Mac world liner and I got that quite a while ago I don't know when I got it and but yeah they do still sell that and I'd pair that with the Mac matte honey love lipstick mine's gonna like really flat now as you can see I use this a lot and then I just pair it with the fancy Beauty full suit and lip gloss so they're the three that I paired together and if I don't if I'm going out I tend to use the velvet teddy lipstick and pair that with the FNT killer lip balm for lip gloss for when I'm going out and the Mac velvet teddy so they're just a little bit darker and again still paired it with that Mac world lip liner so they're the beauty products that I've been living at the minute and as you would have seen earlier on the quick time-lapse of me doing my room and I've got some new products that I've been loving as well I'm a bit of like a clean freak and obsessed with cleaning cleaning products things like that so I didn't actually pick up the Sephora midnight blue and this is the disinfectant and oh my god it smells so now it smells exactly just like alien so I then bought just a little spray bottle and I had this one already and just because I said I am a hairdresser and so I just entered the water out and mixed it with half water and a little bit cat full of the Sephora so I just spray that I spray that on my coat and my blinds my bedding my cushions my Brooks and and my just my doctor's like sleep in my room so I just like to keep it smelling nice and fresh and I do have a lot of mirrored furniture in my bedroom so I use their elbow grease and glass cleaner this is streak free and it's got vinegar in it that cleans them really nice and that in terms of air freshener I use their purple pure lavender air freshener by Eric just to help me sleep better at night and a friend it does really work again clean him up last mirror again just get you real just the standard really and then I also picked up this pomegranate read diffuse it from bnm so just gonna set that up now I'm gonna pop that in so they're all the products that been living recently just by the way for my sister and I'm just gonna sort through the course that I'm selling and had two wardrobes take out of my room in the room to make room for my dressing table so I then realized I've got far too many clothes for the two wardrobes that I have left so I am started selling a lot of them on Facebook and things like that so I've so if I have met a real a lot of money and from selling these things so I just starting out advertise them and then I either deliver to surrounding areas to me where I live or people come and collect them for me so except they have been selling really quick because I just like to get them all started and I've turned my front room into a little bit this is everything that I'm selling and then I just start mints piles of people collecting them and things like that so I do have a few people come in to collect things today so I need to make sure that I'm back for those so like I said I'll just put you on a time lapse I'm just going to quickly start through the clothes now and make sure that everything's ready farther so I've decided to now bake us every time we bake it just seems to disappear everyone eats it so fast so I'm gonna be making and their breath groupings so I've just weighed out MA and sufism for and ma butter and now I've just got to rip the mod and the flour to make bread crumbs I got sort of here doing this it's absolutely disgusting it's it's just not fun to do with just rubbing this in together oh it really goes through stuff like this I hate doing this salsa Kyle's mom's birthday today so I've just wrote her card and wrapped her presents up because we're just gonna take them through now I've just greased both material put me in small dollops and then pop some jam in the middle so I just put them in small dollops come true cuz I can't have done this what does just be there's nothing else to do once I get a lot of questions on this top and it's just from foot asylum in the women's section obviously then you have to make it dumpling in each of the bowls of what you've made and that's when you pop the Germany  I also wanted to quickly jump on here and tell you that this video is access but over two days and yesterday it was the day that I took my sister to her train and I'm and when she came back we had a picnic in the garden and I took a little clip of that but I don't actually and video right I don't think and then for the rest of the day I just spent the day delivering things and people that I bought things so now there's a separate day that I'm baking and delivery more things and it's Kyle's mom's birthday today so we're gonna help you with those and things like that so it is actually split over two days I don't know if I'm gonna make this a weekly bog I'll just split this vlog into two days like have already and I'm not sure I'm up to for the rest of the week but all days are pretty much the same in quarantine it's a little bit boring but a lot of you asks what I get up to so to be honest it's just keeping myself busy and once I picked these kicks I'm gonna probably sit down eat one and probably make some lunch and then like I said going to the doctor's to pick up my tablets I'm not for do that because just it'll be a little bit of a nightmare cuz I'll be my Sookie and it's throwing it down outside yeah I'll just keep you updated with what I get and that's that so this is them when they're done these ones have all stuck together and these are by far the worst ones that I've ever done so that's typical when I'm filming a video but yeah you can get the idea they're still taste exactly the same but like I said the presentation on them is really tricky and so now like I said I'm just gonna wash up the pot and then I'll get back to you when I'm finished that as I said I didn't know whether this was going through a weekly vlog all like a daily vlog but I'm just gonna walk a couple of days and throughout my week probably not every day this is the third day that I'm vlogging and I've just had the lazy morning and just been in the bath and things like that and then one Kyle gets home from work gonna drop a few more parcels with tablets because we didn't go yesterday and there attend the McDonald's drive-thru which I'm so excited about all its I can't wait huh it's been so long to show you my outfits I've got this card chip on from Zara some disabilities from new look I think there and then my new air fast ones just the what white ones with the black I've already got the all-white ones so I thought I'd get some different ones and then just my Valentino bag and all always I get questions of my ring so this middle one sorry not yet is Tiffany anchor this one's Pandora and this one it's also a Pandora and so yeah I just thought I'd answer those questions because I know a lot of you always want to know as well so that's that so I'll probably catch back up with you when we've even got met Donnell's in the queue or something like that so I'll let you know so we're just waiting for McDonald's Kyle is very excited and the kids will be very fast so happy we've literally just hard half of the menu there's a 25 pound limit and we spent twenty on two people how do you feel so huge all the goods I don't think I'm gonna be able to finish all this now so I've just got back from being out on a little driving lesson with my dad we just drove to the house to him back and I didn't like it just because I have to concentrate and so now I'm just back and I'm just gonna do my gels just got raspberry vodka lemonade and for the rest of the night just could be chilly so I'm gonna finish that video here and after I've done the town lots of my nails cuz I'm not up to anything else for the rest of the week only delivering people's clothes again so I'll just leave that here  so that's the end of the video I hope you've all enjoyed this few days and Quarantine vlog on what I got turn things like that's my first vlog style video so I've just done my gels and for the
