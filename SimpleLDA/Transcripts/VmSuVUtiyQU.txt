[Music] hi friends thanks for joining me on today's video the past week has been really difficult a lot of things have been happening and I know me personally I've been scrolling Instagram hours a day I've been watching the news I've been posting I've been free posting I've been sharing my beliefs I've been educating I've been trying to sway people to believe differently and encouraging people to talk to their children and things like that and as much as that is so important to me you know I have responsibilities I have my family to feed I have boxes to pack I have laundry to do I have goals from my own business I have goals for my kids like today I had to take a pea to get her braces off and a sandy Lea to get sealants on their teeth and I gotta come home and I had to pay bills you know just remember that we all do have responsibilities and let's try not to push them to the side and just be so focused on what's going on in the world you know because yes it is important but it does not mean that you can't still accomplish your goals and keep going and that doesn't mean that you don't care any less or you can't help or you're not gonna make as much as a difference but you're going to be disappointed when you like come up for air and realize you weren't paying attention to your goals or other things in life and you're a lot you know more behind than you thought so just keep that in mind there's those videos to kind of catch you guys up on what's going on with the moving process I do have some clips to share I thought I had this one big clip that discussed a very strange encounter with a pool inspector but I'll talk to you guys about that but first I'm gonna play the clips that I have here and then I'll touch bases with you guys real time afterwards hey guys the day after Easter April 13th we are getting out of the house because we have a camera guy photographer at the house he has a drone and he is doing video footage of our house to put it on the market just like a block away watching you we had to get out of the house so that he can do his thing I'm really excited to see what creative video he comes up with he's photographer videographer I'm not sure what you call someone that specializes in drone videography maybe this what is drone videographer I'm really excited about we need to get out of the house I spent the entire morning like decluttering and perfecting everything making sure everything is nice and clean hopefully it is good enough I stash things in closets and such just last minute looks really good the decor is good we actually had to take the pool fence out so that it makes it look nice and clean and open I think it looks better on the virtual tour so yeah we're gonna get lunch that's the news on selling the house it is um the 24th of April and we left the house because we have for poor people that are actually viewing the house today back to back every 30 minutes I actually we do have cameras and we saw that they were like lingering outside the first person they stayed for quite a long time and they're actually texting our realtor with some questions so that's super promising that the first person is actually really interested so we'll see what happens with the other three but we're just going to have a picnic here I my in-laws house on the lawn because we're still in quarantine just to kind of spend some time with them from a distance and hopefully our realtor will text the tzus and give us some good news I'm ready I'm sad I missed the house already even though we're still there but um I'm ready to like knock this off the list and start packing okay friends so we officially accepted the offer well I'm sure I explained it in the vlog previous to this or the little clip before this but they offered something and we counter offered because you weren't happy with it and they accepted the counteroffer so we do not have to worry about anything anymore we actually did one last showing today that was already scheduled because just it's good just to have a backup offer just in case for some reason something happens and they don't qualify or something happens last-minute we can have someone to fall back on it was already scheduled and we didn't want to cancel it so we raced and cleaned the house one last time and we actually saw that they were only in the house for five minutes and didn't even go in the backyard so obviously they weren't interested at all so yeah we just cleaned the house you know for nothing but anyways we're getting gas and supplies right now and then I'm gonna go straight home and get some stuff done I definitely wanted to update you guys that we have officially accepted an offer and now hopefully we'll be able to close in 30 days okay so as you can see we've been planning this move for over a month now we did put our home on the market in the beginning of April just shortly after the shelter in place came into effect we were really nervous about that because we thought who wants to buy during shelter in place but we had already made plans to make this move and made arrangements with EADS work so we were kind of stuck and we just went through with it we were really worried that the house was not gonna sell quickly thankfully within four or five days of the house going on the market we had our first offer and now it is officially sold it's sold in just about 28 to 29 days somewhere around there so it actually moved pretty quickly for being in quarantine we're we're just renting back for a little bit until we can figure out where we're going we already have a house in mind so we're trying to get that house and then once we have that house we'll be able to move into it but for now I'm just home hustling my butt off trying to pack as much as I can Edie's out of town a lot lately so I'm having to do a lot of this on my own but we do have movers that are gonna move us which will make life a little bit easier cuz considering with five kids and a dog it's a lot of work and the last thing I want to do is be hauling this massive u-haul with two cars and five kids and a dog it's ridiculous it's too long of a journey for us hopefully within the next vlog or two we will for sure know what house we want and we will get the house and then I will be able to announce to you guys where we are going meanwhile dealing with all of this and put a little bit of a stress on packing it's not made me that motivated but I'm really trying as hard as possible the four or five different families actually took tours of our home we did purchase booties and sanitizing spray and we had sanitizing gel and gloves and everything right in front of the door everyone was actually very respectful they wear booties mass gloves they actually walked around with their hands behind their back we did have one family that was very disrespectful and I know this because we were watching on cameras because we do have cameras inside and out of our home for protection and safety and especially in these type of situations we wanted to watch them not to be nosy but to know that to know if they touched something so that we can make sure that we sanitize it only because we are during this virus normally we wouldn't have done that but um we are very appalled when this realtor showed up and had no gloves no mask we asked that people take off their shoes as well if they do not want to wear the booties so there was like four or five people in our house that walked in and family and the realtor with their shoes on very disrespectful they were touching things without gloves they didn't even have a mask we were appalled we instantly called our realtor we watched as the realtor hung up with us and directly called them and literally kicked them out of our house it was very disrespectful and it was just really funny because that you can hear them talking and they're like oh well they should have a sign or like like it is the virus be respectful we should not have to put a sign on our door you know it we had everything laid out and we actually put on the initial listing that you need to do the virtual tour first and only if you are a very interested in a serious buyer are you even allowed to come and see the home in person and if you do come you have to take precautions you have to have your mask in your gloves and you have to wear booties or take off your shoes and please do not touch anything you know we had all these stuff in place but that you know so that was very difficult is very nerve-wracking trying to sell a home and show home during this pandemic so I'm glad it's over with that I'm glad there was only a very small limited amount of heat that actually toured the house so anyways I'm blabbing but I just kind of want to give you an idea of like how this process worked at how quickly we were able to sell it and some of the bumps that we encountered along the way I know I'm just like rambling at this vlog so if you are still here thanks it's nice chatting with you I'm gonna go about my day and get this video up for you guys as soon as possible it's June 1st now so hopefully this will be a I don't know maybe June 2nd or June 3rd and then I will be able to post another one right away hopefully with the news that we are waiting for so that I can share our location I think you guys are gonna be pretty surprised I mean there's been a lot of people saying only think they're going here I think they're going there and I'm like girl hmm I haven't heard it yet so I'll see you guys the next vlog stay home stay safe and let's spread some love and some peace and ask each other if you're okay okay bye guys take care of yourselves
