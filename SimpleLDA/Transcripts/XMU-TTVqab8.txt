  good morning guys it's super early but I really want to get a workout in before I do all the stuff that needs to be done today because today is gonna be a productive day in my life lately I've been doing Pilates which I feel like is the perfect mix of strength training and yoga moves because sometimes yoga is too slow for me if I want to get like my heart racing but I do love incorporating some yoga moves into my workout I actually really like Claudia's workout claudius loose skis workout this morning I'm going to get a video done that's why I am all dressed up right now not in my normal t-shirt and sweat pants cut well I'm still wearing some pants still wearing some pants but you know I'm looking a little glam so I'm about to go film a video but first I have a white work not emergency but a little thing I need to get sorted before I film a video so yeah I have a long list of things to do today so I figured this would be a good vlog to film because I feel like my last couple day in the life vlogs I've done they've been pretty chill and they haven't really been entirely reflective of how busy I've been I just feel like I have so much stuff to do which is good it's good to keep busy at least for me because the first month of quarantine I was kind of just not doing anything at all if I can successfully get everything I need to get done done today then tomorrow will be a little bit more of a relaxed day now I'm going to film my video I just need to finish doing my hair cuz it's not looking too great I look like I'm actually going out to do things but I'm going into my living room  I have to do some vacuuming because I feel like my sister and I shed so much there's hair literally all over the floor so I have to vacuum like twice a week and then more importantly I have to Swiffer the bathroom we had maintenance come in yesterday because something was wrong with our sink and they had to like fix it the people who came to fix it they left footprints everywhere and the floor is gross so I have to clean that up I already cleaned like the sink and everything and I disinfected everything don't worry I just have to clean the floor and I didn't do that yesterday because I was feeling too lazy but I'm gonna do it now I want to get as much editing as I can done before Rebecca texts me it's 5 o'clock now and her shift ends at 5 but usually your shift goes over because she's working in the hospital so I'm gonna meet her at the grocery store because we are in desperate need of groceries right now I should probably throw this out I finished this pint earlier this van luhan's cookies and cream oh my god man Luis has the best ice cream in my opinion it's so good I feel like I've been busy all day this day has been non-stop I took a brief break started watching working moms season 3 on Netflix while eating my lunch and then I had the leftover ice cream picking up Netflix actually we finished Hollywood I have my opinions I think the first two episodes were really good then at some point in episode 3 Rebecca and I looked at each other like and we literally said to each other was it this cheesy this whole time why is everyone like over at not everyone why are certain people overacting in this scene they thought it was a joke and then it wasn't it got progressively cheesier until the very end I don't know what happened I feel like the first two episodes were really good and then it of wasn't that good anymore I feel like everything that happened in this season could have been stretched out in like into two seasons I feel like they rushed so many storylines and they did too much too soon too quickly there were so many things that they tried like so many topics that they touched on which I usually like when a show does that like when I was talking about little fire I mean it's a completely different show but little fires everywhere for example touched on a ton of different topics but they did it so well and they like carefully discussed and crafted the storyline behind each of the topics but for this show they just I feel like they were throwing all of the topics all of the social issues in like one shot and I feel like they didn't take enough time to really develop those stories like I would have loved to see you know there's a romance that happens I would have loved to see how that came to be instead of all of a sudden you're saying I love you like what I didn't even know you guys were together I feel like there was no character development I mean maybe there were like two character arcs but they were so quick if season two comes out will I be watching it absolutely of course because it's not like I hated it I just was kind of disappointed by it at this point I'm just procrastinating but I should probably get on to the edit because it's five o'clock and I should probably post this video before midnight oh I'm excited my Nordstrom package came in the mail I got my collagen peptides from vital proteins I was gonna order this on Amazon but a lot of people were saying you might not be getting the real thing if you order it from there even though there are a lot of really good reviews some people are like beware you might be getting a fake product I didn't want to risk it so I just bought it from at Nordstrom and I also got this polished choice skin perfecting 2% BHA liquid exfoliant you guys know I've been on my skincare kick on YouTube so a lot of people have been recommending polished choice specifically this product I think it's a toner so and I think I'm just gonna disinfect everything because that's what I've been doing I don't know if it's overkill but I don't take any chances I don't know if you guys have noticed but I have been changing up the intro that everyday may intro slightly for each video you probably haven't noticed but I change up like the song or the pacing whatever I feel like I constantly want to change it up or improve it somehow and I feel like for every video every video has a different vibe so like why not change it up let me know if you guys have noticed it if not it's totally fine but I I mainly just do it for me because I feel like I'd get bored of having the same intro for every video so we went to the grocery store we went grocery shopping and then we made some dinner and watched some Grey's Anatomy and then yeah so now my video is exporting so while it's exporting I'm doing some laundry that's probably gonna be it for the day it's probably gonna be uploaded pretty late tonight but you know it's alright it all all that matters is that I got a video up today tomorrow is gonna be definitely more relaxed day because I got pretty much everything on my to-do list done so tomorrow I can wake up late and relax and that's exactly what I wanted to do I'm so tired but yeah I think I'm gonna end the vlog here so thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you tomorrow with another video
