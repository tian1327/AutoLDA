 normally I don't eat cereal but kovat 19's changed a lot of our behavior so  okay all right so today is May 2nd and what that means is we are still in the middle of this coronavirus pandemic and I am actually genuinely curious what the airports look like what the planes look like how full they are how empty they are what they're requiring us to do and normally I would go nonstop from Chicago to Dallas but because Dallas has a quarantine right now so different states have different executive orders and things like that that are in place for self quarantine or certain restrictions and so Texas in particular has a 14 day quarantine for anybody that's coming in from Chicago or Detroit or New York or I think Louisiana things like that so all these different you know cities are hot spots and as of May 2nd there's still a executive order for that so I actually want to know if I get to the airport are they gonna stop me and how they're gonna make me fill out a form as I've heard many rumors for and are they're gonna check up on me is the police gonna come to my house and are they actually gonna stop me and say hey you know you and your house or whatnot so I'm curious I'm going through Denver today as a one stop just because I want to test it I want to see if they catch me in that system when they see me arriving from Denver but originating from Chicago and so will there still be a check there a screening that remains to be seen let's go to O'Hare International Airport if I just parked and I noticed that this place is way emptier than normal and I'm gonna get myself ready here we've got to put this on it's gonna be hard to breathe from here on out but okay alright so dude check this out this parking lot is normally super full but it is very empty and you can tell that there's a lot of empty space there's a lot of security too let's get our stuff and then let's get out of here so have to breathe in this day hours   all right so you can tell that there's not really that much traffic or activity so far so I'm gonna go in and see so now I got a ridiculous box that I've got to check in so I'm gonna check that in get through security yeah I think the most difficult thing so far is I've had this mask on for maybe 20 minutes and I seriously have a hard time breathing right now we'll see what that looks like as I go through so let's go in we'll check our bags and  get open yeah thank you so much so I just got out of the security line took me like 30 seconds to get through honest years like nobody in line a couple of interesting observations I have noticed two things first obviously there's not a lot of people here as you can tell second there's a lot of people coming out of like a few flights so I know I've checked online and normally they'll have like six or seven flights operating in one day but they've canceled all that and they have basically a morning one maybe like an evening one basically just a couple in a day and I think they've just packed all the passengers into one or two of these flights and they're just coming out I'll just these few flights and so you know I checked on my app for my particular flight the first leg to Denver and it looks fairly packed so I'm a little concerned because they've told us that they'd you know as much as possible leave the middle seat open and you know in the flight that I have now that doesn't look like it's the case thankfully you know I might be upgraded I have status with United or whatnot but so I'll probably have a little bit more space but the other interesting observation is that I've noticed plague 99% of people all have their masks on so you know obviously government's giving a mandatory requirement for these masks to be worn a lot of the airline's now we're saying you can't get on the flight without a mask so I don't know if you don't have a master she's gonna provide it or not I'm so hungry right now we got this  we got this yeah I'm so hungry right now I'm gonna get some food oh yeah the best thing that I'm eating McDonald's right now reading cereal this morning  yeah good for you thank you    50 so today we should have a good writer that it will be a little bump in my mouth there's a mosquito spent on the policeman's you see folks Matheny refers a nice buzz right all the way to the rich in the dipper and then has be a sense that salience in Denver it will be bumping it will be turned on the seatbelt signs on a little Berlin today  I see that boffins areas around your seat make sure you have all your belonging  right thank you  archives just landed in Denver International Airport it's pretty quiet here to be honest normally on a Saturday this would be super packed but as you can see very very little activity so this is the wing that United has their hub in from be all the way down camera will be so yeah just landed 5:30 p.m. and we're gonna go to our next gate and a little bit of a tour around some of the things that are open so many things that are closed so let's go check that out they've taken off taken off line the dryers so that you could they could minimize the spread of kovin 19 all right so far so good you know the bathrooms are clean they got rid of the hand dryer things there's just a lot of people cleaning like everywhere all right so I see my first door I've never seen a store open before Joe so this is kind of a middle concourse area for the terminal there's a lot of places open it's gonna go take a quick swing through the area to see what's open but already a lot of places are closed so this is middle of Denver's United Terminal coffee shop all coffee shops are closed got out chick-fil-a's opened up so check out your Co they all right so the seating area is closed all the fast food chains are open though anything that has a sit down generally they're closed I'm going to go upstairs to the section where there's a lot of restaurants to see what the situation looks like I'm gonna lie I'm really tired because I'm carrying this really heavy like double bag with a camera bag like a very heavy camera bag and all my laptops and I have this mask on and it's so hard to breathe and I'm just trying to you can tell I'm out of shape too cuz I just haven't been working out though I smoked in half but and yeah chuckles sexist upright okay well let's take a look at this I haven't seen this yet so at this bar it looks like there's people all around there but they're all spaced apart six feet so I have some places open for sit down but it is with social business thing in mind fell  all right so I'm at my gate and looks like everybody's boarded but that's crazy because what time is it flat 56 I guess boarded like seven minutes ago there's really not many people here it's going to take a look so I should look chewy okay thank you okay sounds good haven't played Kathy Adi and went out so first class a little less time that's have status are on this flight bus when I looked it was super empty so less than half capacity support has been annexed our 26 was flying to Dallas there is but the next hour 26 figured out what to do when you get there     Dallas Fort Worth now going forward the local time is about 9 9 p.m.  yeah you too thank you  alright hey guys thanks for joining me on this trip overall I would say my experience was pretty good considering you know the current kovat situations we're living in I got here safely that's what mattered and Texas didn't stop me to sign a quarantine agreement I didn't see a lot of state troopers roaming the airport but they paid no attention to a flight coming in from Denver I think the hardest part was definitely breathing in that KN 95 mask I had otherwise as you saw the airports were pretty empty and the airplanes were moderately empty going forward if you are considering flying I would say quite honestly that if you're just pre cautious it is safer than you would think you know with the hygiene protocols in place and the improvements and the airline's processes it's not different than going to your local grocery store as long as you maintain social distancing and just to be safe and sure you you aren't you know sitting next to anyone on the plane and just use extra precaution but I think being crippled by fear shouldn't deter you from flying especially if you have to you know get somewhere and as long as you're precautious you should be okay anyway thanks again guys and see you soon
