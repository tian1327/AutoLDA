 hey guys so just doing a quick small short vlog about my quarantine self it's been two weeks now that we're in the house and we are now mandatory shut and shut down you're gonna hear noise in the background cuts everybody in the house because I can't leave it's hard with my kids cuz they're only two and four and they don't understand why we can't go outside my sounds like I want to go out I want to go to the city and I'm like I can't and like hard to explain to him because I also don't want to scare him either so it's been um interesting it's like really funny because before this quarantine before the virus was like broke out and became like a thing my husband I were watching 28 days later like literally day before the news broke out there though the virus destroying the planet and were just like oh my god like this did we just get a metaphor of our lives I don't know I just found that funny I probably other people won't find that funny but I for some reason find that hilarious um yes I am nervous and anxious because I do live in New York and we're happy sensor of this virus 80 percent of us is estimated to catch it and it's just like a matter of time for people everybody gets in at me now I'm not trying to be pessimistic but I'm also realistic person and I don't want anyone together but I so people follow the rules we just merrily we just have really we just a really populated city or state and the husband is essential worker so of course he's out in the public he's a bus driver so he is constantly surrounded by people and who could possibly carry the disease which we don't want them to carry it but it can happened and I mean as a disease I mean virus didn't see his virus I'm not sure but um yeah so he's of course very nervous every time he leaves the house to go to work also my mother-in-law works in a hospital and then her husband's also bus driver so they're all out and about not wanting to be out and about but are forced to because there are essential workers and it's so funny I have to say like you see in like this time who are the people who are needed and people always did great restaurant workers and grocery store workers gas station workers even like bus drivers get like old does it date that's your job but come to find out they're the ones that are most important cuz lawyers not important right now other but clean few new people who are acclaimed we're always going to be acclaimed are doctors and people work in the medical field and pharmacists but like you see who are the real essential workers when there's a crisis going down so I just find that really interesting it's like I hope it humbles some people who think that they're like better than others because just cuz you have a really great job does I mean it's gonna help the plant does that it's gonna good to do much less your medical field a public service field or an accounting field you're gonna help old tech field they're very being very helpful because everything is tech now it's anyway we're all communicating in anyway we're all watching each other so it's really interesting it's like um and then my son is remote learning which is funny because I didn't want to send them to school in September when we first started I went to home-school him as was like well you know who was going him ain't come to find out technically I am homeschooling him he doesn't we just started video chatting with his teachers and classmates um in the morning in the afternoon so that's cool and then of course the night has to do lessons so they sent me and then I also of course incorporate my own lessons because of course whatever I used to work with kids so teaching is not that hard it's just my son understanding that he has to do school bomb work at home is the challenge he doesn't understand why does he have to do school at home when school is for school but it's where it's a work in progress that we're gonna hopefully achieve so yeah yes I am nervous yes I am anxious do I think I'm gonna get this probably not because we're taking precautions to make sure that we're all healthy clean taking our vitamins making sure every time we leave the house we come in work take things off wash your hands wash your face and stuff like that and we don't really leave the house that often - we I already I did my panic buying yes I am the person who panic buys food not put on the paper I did not do the total toilet paper in all sense but if I go to the store and I see the toilet paper available I will be cat grabbing some or bouncing napkins because they are scarce what's the supermarket and they were already putting a limit on meat so that was a little bit interesting it's like oh my god it's like apocalyptic times and it's like ah hopefully in a month or two this end and we're back to normal but until then we'll be living in a quarantine life and I feel my heart goes out to all the other countries who have been seriously affected by this like Italy like a lot of European countries really are getting feeling like it's bad it's bad um in America it's hasn't gotten to that point like them but it's like getting there and it's like really never which is why I have not been checking the news or checking anything on my phone because they don't want to freak out don't want to freak out because for some reason like I didn't think I had anxiety but every time I like look at the news or look at the numbers I started like this tension in my shoulders and my hands start to get the Chi and it's like I started like my chest s to her and then I realized oh my god I'm having an anxiety attack so I been trying my best not to look at the news and not worry as much just enjoy the moments here at home with my kids as he drives me crazy because I'm one of two toddlers if you have little kids you know they drive you insane because they want something every five minutes it's like oh my god Kisha is getting yourself but they can't so yeah even people have older kids like just trapped at home like I sympathize for all parents right now your kids can't leave the house and hopefully we get good weather we only had one really good day so the killer able to go to the backyard and play but it was only one day so far in the past two weeks so hopefully it stops raining so that's being cold becomes a little bit sunny and warm so that they can least be outside all day and maybe we could do some lessons outside but yeah of course I'm in this video of the after I finished my talking I will show clips of what we've been doing and a little fun we've had so far the beam in quarantine was funny saying that looks like it's like what you hear in movies here my son back come on Zoey so it's just like surreal really I feel like it's surreal and I'm like nobody am I just doing this vlog to like record this and see what's going on so I can look back in a few years and be like oh my god that really happens cuz this is like not real and it's crazy it's in sanity and scary but I feel like as long as you follow the guidelines to protect yourselves in your family good just hope it's results sooner than later and yeah so thanks so much for watching oh let me know down below how you're doing what country you're from or state or city how's it going where you live is it getting better is it getting worse my thoughts are with you my wishes are with you and I hope that everyone stay safe and sound and sorry for anyone who has experienced a loss or sickness their desk is playing yeah we just have had some crazy times right now and it's been 20/20 has really keep us all in the butt so thank you so much for watching please like and subscribe and check out some clips of some cute kids having a grand ol time not knowing what the heck is going on and me wishing I was laughing by now   Fillie  what are you up to Matthew boy
