  so I start every morning around 7:00 a.m. my sleep schedule is pretty much stayed the same which is really nice and I start every day by making my bed which is such a key and although I do wake up at 7 a.m. I usually spend about an hour scrolling through tick-tock watching YouTube videos and you're reading the news so by the time I get up it's really like a varity usually good morning it is Monday for writing at Wednesday Tuesday Saturday honestly I don't know what date it is so I'd like to say that I do my skincare routine every day but honestly that's not the truth I try to do my morning routine as close to my normal schedule as possible but sometimes I really just when I woke up this morning I was like it's cloudy I don't want to do anything you know Coffee time I have to start every single day with a cup of coffee and it's really unfortunate but it's just what it is you know yeah so I have the cured cafe it has been an absolute lifesaver for me and I used the donut shop and Starbucks K Cups and Caribou Coffee K Cups and they're super delicious and they make lattes and cappuccinos and iced coffee and black coffee and yeah I don't know what I would be doing without them all right so now we have everyone's favorite segment cooking with G and no one actually calls with that but we're just gonna go ahead and get into it breakfast is by far my favorite meal of the day it's my favorite to cook my favorite to eat yeah that's just uh not even a hot to it because I feel like a lot of people feel that way so I honestly have loved cooking during quarantine it's so much fun I put on good tunes and cook so many different types of meals I think breakfast is by far like the most is where the most diversity stems from I guess some days I have like oatmeal and bananas smoothies bagel sandwiches and then other days I get really crafty and make chocolate chip pancakes which here I just use like a pancake box mix it's super easy I just add chocolate chips and they taste really good serve that up with some bananas and some syrup and all really kilt the game I can't I like chefs kiss like love it but yeah I've loved cooking and I don't know it's just like a source of like calmness I guess because I am truly in control of what's going on I'm at least most of the time so yeah I've definitely been enjoying that also omelettes have gotten a little bit more creative if you've been watching my videos for a while you know that my go-to is usually like spinach mushroom cheese and in this one I added some tomatoes and some bell peppers and it truly changed the game Oh a sausage and it tasted so good like so good and I got a ton of spinach in there gotta get that leafy greens you know better get those nutrients those vitamins and I do leave the veggies in the pan and then add the egg I think it helps it turn out better in the end it's just a hypothesis I've no idea that's accurate yeah super yummy and then I also made French cows for the first time in this apartment and it was so good I used some ciabatta bread that I literally picked up from my bakery and not my bakery I don't have a bakery but it's like the kind that you take home and then you've stick in the oven for a bit yeah I got that and cutting the slices and made some little I'll leave the link to the recipe down below but it was so good top that with some berries because it is strawberry season honey and they tasted village and then really the only source of stability in my time and quarantine has been the fact that I make avocado toast so freaking much I did not realize it until I was going through this vlog footage and I was like oh my god I think I make avocado toast at least like every other day and avocados are so expensive so we got to cut that out but it's such an easy meal seriously I made it in so many blogs you literally just mash up the avocado on some toast and slap an egg on there and it's so good yeah but I have it so much and it truly is the only constant in my life so we're gonna leave the bonnet because it's like 10 a.m. and we are way beyond that part of the day so let's just do it quick little fix up wearing at the same shirt I've been wearing for like three days  what's that party people I'm wearing these do like glasses you know I'm not looking at a screen because my eyebrows are atrocious so I think like pretty much everyone my living room has to come live primary workspace I will light a candle and turn on the coffee shop playlist on Spotify which is my new favorite thing and it's literally like I'm working in my favorite coffee shop and I love it if you're new here hello I'm Gabby I don't think I ever introduced myself but yeah so anyway I'm a grad student NYU so my nine-to-five job is really working in a lab on my own project and I also had a couple classes this semester so I would do that during the day but because my job's not really something that really transfers to a work from home scenario I've really just been doing a bunch of research a bunch of reading and really just trying to get ready for my qualifying exam which is basically the equivalent of doing a master's thesis and yeah so I would get on zoom' for classes and read papers and just really get a head on the grant writing process as well which I want to submit this summer and yeah I just really need to get organized on all of my literature because I've read a lot of papers but I haven't really organized it in a way that'll be easy to access later so I've been working on that using gosh what do they called you're like citation organizers that's not what they're called but that's like the gist of them like um min delay and like I think people use like a Google something and notes that kind of thing and then on some days in the afternoon I work on my YouTube videos and I've been redoing my personal website so that's been a lot of fun as well and a kind of a good break from all the science that I've been like ingesting and another day in quarantine life got lunch goin so I don't know if it's just me but I actually find lunch to be one of the hardest meals to make at home and I think it's probably why I would buy food from the hospital cafeteria so much but I've really just been doing a bunch of like wraps and leftovers and like sandwiches I I made like the most banging chicken sandwich the other day it had chicken breast avocado BBQ sauce some pepper jack cheese lettuce tomato on it's really good bread and I'm living my best life and yeah so it's really just been kind of like making stuff up  so I do like to take a little portion of every afternoon - you know if I need to run errands or do stuff around the apartment mostly cleaning and then I do it then yes I have my little station of coveted items being masks and alcohol swabs and and wipes and things and I do laundry in the morning really but if I needed to I could do it then - and yeah I've got my little koi I have a lot of my groceries and things delivered at this time of day and I've been wiping everything down and I think it's funny because I'm not really sure if the data actually suggests that this helps at all but it makes me feel better so you know also if any of my college friends or watching your handsome sweet baby Ray's before groceries I do have delivered from Amazon fresh or Target it's also at the point where I do a lot of dishes I don't know again if I'm the only person who literally makes so many dirty dishes it's kind of like a small village is living in this apartment and not just a single person and I really try and not let them stack up I tried clean them after every meal if I can but sometimes I am lazy and I don't but this is like a really proud time - yeah but I don't use my dishwasher either because I'm strange I guess I also usually call my dad at this time of day wagwan cleaning and things here I actually clean my mirror for the first time I think in forever I like to sweep and mop as well everything top to bottom got to keep it clean yeah so my afternoons have definitely been like my favorite part of my day because I really just do whatever it is that I want to do and whether that's facetiming my friends which I love and always been the singular reason why have it gone insane living by myself for the past few months but I also can bake all the banana bread that my heart desires Blondie's and chocolate chip cookies or whatever learning French in Italian on duolingo has been really interesting and something I put off her a while what else yeah I've been making a lot of sweets so like exercising has been you know taking up some of my time I try to do it you know every other day and with a circuit training or virtual like zumba and hip-hop classes I'm an instructor that I take here in the city usually it's been a lot of fun as well I've also been trying to learn more like design skills so I'm really not strong with illustrations so there are these videos on YouTube by Tila Cunningham she posts anyone every week that are really easy to follow and really helpful and of course like pretty much everyone I still have those moments where I have mini panic attacks and question my entire life plan and those are never fun but you know I read a lot of news and I think that's probably you know the perpetrator I guess so I've been kind of relaxed on the news front but I don't know I think it's good to be interests about you sometimes but yeah because these are such interesting times like I feel like I hope that we never have to experience anything like this ever again because it is so wild and I don't think that we were at all for Barre chord message my friends who would have not  I'm feeling a pizza so I think that's what we're gonna do I'm actually really excited about it so I don't know why it never occurred to me to make pizza at home before cause it's literally so easy and I did it as a kid a lot but yeah so I used these cauliflower crust instead of making my own dough which is sufficient saves a lot of time yeah but it's really just like the cauliflower crust I put bell pepper on it which is super yummy and makes a colorful and pretty which is always important through those insta stories you know but yeah so it's really easy you just put whatever toppings on there I think I also added like tomatoes and mushrooms and spinach and cheese yeah it was really pretty some sausage - it's really pretty and it was super easy to make it's very quick and yeah pizzas then definitely a go - oh I look so good gooey masterpiece love and then this I usually make for both lunch and dinner but I guess I should better here but sweet potato fries also look at that beautiful washing hands technique I love to see it awesome but Sue potato fries are super easy to make as well and it's funny because I have a person sue potato fries in my freezer but I just love making my own so I take the skin off of them you don't have to do that but I think they look better on the edges all the skins on and I skin it and then I just cut it in long strips I make them a little bit on the thicker side because if you make them too thin they'll be like burnt all the way through which is not good yeah and I topped it with olive oil and some cinnamon and a little bit of sea salt and mix that up super yummy throw that in the oven I think I cook it at four twenty five twenty minutes literally silently if it's full maybe it's for twenty five yeah okay so 83-75 and then I made my own meatballs which was inexperienced um I used ground turkey and mashed that up I'll leave the recipe down below here does some breadcrumbs I think and I mean meatballs they were honestly pretty good I was very surprised with my abilities but yeah it made the recipe made a ton and I use half of them for the spaghetti that I put in some tomato sauce and oh wait no it wasn't spaghetti it was linguine because I don't really like spaghetti I think it's too thin I like that when we knees a little bit we love that    by the Constitution of the United States just keepin kind of way to do this come on Connie answers oh no man wouldn't do for love baby  pretty a peg i finished season 1 of a Westworld which is the only show in a long time where I've literally been like what is happening so those are the days of my life in quarantine yeah through here
