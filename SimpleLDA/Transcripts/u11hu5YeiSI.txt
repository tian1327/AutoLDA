 hey guys welcome back to the daily departure and good afternoon slash morning from my couch because it is about 1217 right now and I just got up about 50 minutes ago if you are new here I am in Chicago based light attendant and I make travel flight attendant end that lifestyle videos and if you are new don't forget to subscribe and also hit the belt icon so you get notifications when I post new videos I just figured I would vlog today because I haven't vlogged for like a week or so I just like I haven't been on the vlog thing because I just haven't felt like it I think we're gonna go for a run later to the lake it's about two Neff miles all the way from our apartment to the Lake Shore Drive Lake Michigan area but it's really cloudy right now so I think we're gonna hold off on that for a bit I guess the other thing I've been doing today is looking for a dress because my middle sister that lives up in Minnesota is getting married in a little over two weeks so we are actually gonna fly up to Minnesota in a week so we can quarantine for two weeks before the wedding because she's still gonna have just like a really small wedding just so she'd get married and then her actual wedding they postponed it to be on the same or similar date next June I have to get a dress for it because we're obviously not gonna wear our bridesmaid dresses that we're gonna wear next year for her wedding this year because it's gonna be super small there's gonna be like ten people there if even so I need to find one online and there's like nothing online that I'm finding that I like everything's either like informal or it's like too formal and or not the color that I like or the style that I like I don't like having to find such a big dress for an event and obviously too I'm like in a time crunch now I don't know why I didn't do this weeks ago but that's on me I guess also the past couple days we have gone to the target which is like a little over a mile from our apartment and there's a target that's really close to our apartment but it's one of those city targets so it's really small and limited in what they have this room I'll run the other day and then we went in the target and shopped around a little bit because there were some things that we wanted to pick up and then we end up Oh bring home that day and it felt so good to be in a real large store not just a grocery store like I'll actually be able to get out and shop around felt like we were normal humans again and it kind of took our mind off of quarantine a bit and so we ended up going back yesterday as well because there was something else we forgot to pick up so we ended up running there and then the line was actually super long to get in there's a parking garage attached to it and the line looped like out the door all the way to the back of the parking garage it's a pretty big parking garage so there were a lot of people in line to go to Target which was kind of crazy wind up shopping around for a little bit and then we ran back home with our stuff so yeah we've been taking the term target run literal I guess the past couple days but again it was just so nice to be in a real target because I really don't ever get to go to a real target and if you love Target you know how great it is just to kind of browse around and shop and see everything that they have even if you're not gonna buy anything you will still end up walking out of the store buying things because they have just such amazing products we were trying to hang this up in my sister's bedroom and one thing went in there and the wall anchor broke this anchor right here and then this anchor we were trying to put in it cracked in half so that's hard DIY project is going so we already have one of these coat hangers in our entryway and my dad actually installed that one but of course we were like we got this we know how to do it now and completely failed the project so no DIY team projects for us anymore I think the one I did in the beginning of quarantine is I think as good as it's gonna get now feels so cloudy out look at those clouds like we got back from our run and we ended up running five miles all the way down to the lakeshore and then back and then we ran to CVS afterwards where we picked up some items and I've been trying to drink more protein because we've been working out so much speak to this delicious vanilla protein shake and it is from the organics it is vegan plant-based super delicious I have only ever tried a couple other vegan protein things and they were disgusting this one is really good and the cashier lady too was like this is my favorite and I've only ever found it at CVS I'm like the same it was on sale which is why I got it also on sale we found Easter candy so my sister bought some of that it was a 90% off which is crazy they were like 13 cents for the items that we bought or 26 cents like everything was super cheap I also got mochi ice cream s'mores flavor I saw it and I was like I need this because I love any kind of s'mores flavored sweets just my favorite absolutely love it we were going to make some fluffy Japanese pancakes later which I just finished uploading a video on what to do in Japan or what to eat and how to get around in Japan and I'm talking about the fluffy pancakes and that I'm also thinking about doing a quarantine cooking video on them so if they work out today and they taste good I will do a quarantine cooking video on them possibly and if you want to watch some my other recipes you can go ahead and check those out after the run I just got back and I did my hair really quick I just fixed it up with the Dyson Air app because my hair is so curly that when I run and when I sweat it just gets like frizzy curly bomb mess we also went to the rooftop after we got done working out because it was kind of nice out it was a little chilly but nice running weather I would say it was like 50 upper 50s which is a pretty great temperature in my opinion to run in so I'm just gonna finish out the rest of the evening hanging out watching some movies like 6:00 p.m. right now can make hopping for cake and then we have the meringue over here in the kitchen and that we are working on just whisking some eggs and honestly we'll see how this goes they're not fluffy a little pancakes they are flat oh no all right pancakes I'm glad we recipe tested before we book them they look really good expectation versus reality this is how they look they look like real pancakes one of these is supposed to be the size of all of these because they're supposed to be fluffy it's the only things they're gonna taste like eggs just try it out hey this stuff is the best we're gonna put it on the pancake let's try it they definitely don't taste like a regular pancake they're pretty good they're all right so I'm not the biggest fan of them I think I'm gonna eat ramen for dinner and so this this is just gonna be like my trial snack and then I'm gonna eat ramen that I made last night just so good so that's gonna be my dinner tonight and we are going to watch a pulp fiction later on because we just got stars today we did a free trial because we figured we've run out of movies that we wanted to watch on our other streaming services we were like let's try it out and ironically am wearing my pulp fiction shirt today and I put this on and then we decided to watch the pulp fiction after slash I'm forcing her to watch it because it's my favorite movie got my movie all queued up I'm gonna enjoy that for the rest of the night we hope you guys like taking along with me on my blog today don't forget to subscribe to the daily departure and also hit the bell icons to get notifications when I'm new videos and I will see you
