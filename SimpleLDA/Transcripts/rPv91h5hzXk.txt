 hey guys what's up welcome back to my channel today is going to be the start of a few days vlog it's definitely a really weird time right now I'm back home on Long Island where I'm from I know a lot of people are home with their families right now during the time of the coronavirus basically everything shut down for two weeks stores and things like that are still open thank God because I have to go and get a few things today before I kind of before my family and I guess self quarantine if that's what you want to call it we're not like going and dieting or whatever but we're trying not to like go to the store and stuff as much but today is like the last day we're just gonna finish running our errands and things like that thinking of all of you guys hope you're staying safe during this time I don't want to be insensitive and like not talk about it but I still I'm gonna vlog and like show you guys what we're doing in this house I'm home today with my mom my dad and my brother so it's just us we're hanging out it's just really nice to be home with my loved ones during this crazy time like I feel like you put on the news and it's just like mass hysteria and it's crazy and it's it's very real like the fear is so real I feel like but all you can do is just like be around people you love wash your hands and stay healthy you know that's just how I'm looking at I'm trying my best obviously I don't want to spread it but anyways subscribe if you guys are new it's just gonna be a few days of dealing with this craziness of the world my brothers in high school and I think it's about to be canceled for two weeks his sports are canceled basically everything's just like put on pause for two weeks we are postponing the house at the go live show if you had a ticket check your email cuz we probably sent out information via email already about that so check your email right now I'm actually gonna go to CBS I came home and I packed up really quickly and I forgot a few things which is really annoying but just like deodorant and a few basic things and I mean I asked my family if they need anything else might go to Starbucks and grab some breakfast and then pop back over here basically the grocery stores are out of everything like they were out of eggs today insane so my parents are like anytime someone goes out we're gonna like asks to ask the whole family like what they need and make a list it's just insanity I haven't gone to the stores yet but apparently the shelves are like cleared so that's really scary just so crazy my parents did tell me to get paper towels though I don't know should I get like single rolls everything they have Native that's crazy I think I'm literally just gonna get like a cheaper deodorant only like a week this is crazy it just it's better if you use my coat it's like not it took you get like three for 20 or something that's insane little haul from the store because I showed you guys everything's out but I just picked up I didn't bring home a face wash I really like SATA fell it's just like super gentle I wanted to get native deodorant but it's twelve dollars a stick at Walgreens mom I haven't won here oh yeah well I'll give this to my brother then I guess I like the men's scented deodorants actually no people do it I'm telling you that's like people doing it it is a thing okay and then I just got body lotion because my skin is dry and I didn't bring home body lotion either because yeah and then I had this in the car just popcorn that I got like reading stacks I got my mom coffee and then I got a chai tea latte and a breakfast sandwich and hopefully I don't know if leave my house much more the fact that this is only day two is kind of insane because I'm already bored I mean I could obviously find things to do and I plenty of books to read and things like that but I mean I guess this would be a normal Saturday for me if I was just home by myself but I probably would have gone out if I was in Boston which I know isn't the best thing so home I think I'm about to redownload The Sims or maybe even treat myself and purchase the new one I've been seeing all the ads on Tech Talk for The Sims I think that there might be like a new or one out or you could get it like all loaded up and kind of I mean like a Sims mood right now you guys ever get in those moods where you're like if you played this Amos when you were younger you get it like I was always a big like Sims webkinz called penguin I know everyone had their thing that Sims was like really my thing Animal Crossing doesn't come out until next Friday I just went on my switch and I was like looking for a game to play but I just I'm gonna wait for when Animal Crossing comes out because I don't wanna spend any more money unlike the switch game I'd rather just play a computer game this is says that I actually am seeing a lot of stories and stuff to people who are like out drinking because it's like st. Patrick's Day weekend but I'm like does the smartest idea but I don't really know the world is just like so confusing right now we're gonna eat dinner in a little bit my family we're gonna do like a pasta thing it's just nice spending time with them too you guys know I love spending time with my family so it's much later very boring today but I ate dinner and I basically ate so much this is the problem with when I'm home I just non-stop eat so I'm gonna work out tomorrow luckily we have a gym in our house which I need to use we're gonna read a little bit of the untethered so I'm almost done it's a pretty dense book I feel like when I first got it I was like this isn't very dense but it's like you read a chapter and you're like well like I need a second to process it because it's very they're not that long but it's like it makes you really think that's why it's like a really good book um so I'm gonna just read this I took some melatonin gummies and go to bed and my average a pajama set - I just feel great right now good night so my family does we do pH water basically so this is called fountain health it's here in koh mak and we have to refill this big bottle and they like drink out of it basically that's what we do for water and I would send today to get the water so let's go a bit later and now I'm going to go downstairs to the gym and I'm gonna go workout just treadmill and I think watching beauty videos while we do so you get some water I'm selling me on her heat gear Costco it always feels warm you know you're like sweating I don't know how today still warm and it was like 10 cents I'm not actually look at my glasses on because I want to bring them upstairs when she's over mad swollen yes she got but not least what's a call a true canal no it was oral surgery in other words oh okay that we had some salads before she's taking her meds go I'm gonna pop down I'm gonna try to get 45 minutes we'll see how this goes all right I'm sitting here just did a little treadmill moment this is the gym very lucky to have in my house my dad and my brother are big workout guys so I'm well my mom - she works out here all the time but the weights and stuff is my dad my brother mostly we'd love George a moment later in the evening I'm gonna read a little bit more of my book I just took one of these I took one last night and it really I slept through the night so peacefully and I didn't have nightmares but sometimes when I take new melatonin I have nightmares and I didn't this is just the sequel's melatonin today's update it is this is Sunday March 15th I don't know when this video was going up or how many days it's gonna be I'm gonna vlog into tomorrow too for this big open anyways today's update I feel like it's like a diary of like what's going on in the world right now but it really is on this channel right now I'm just thankful like being a safe space with my family everything I know I keep saying that even though I do have to leave sometimes than like today I took over on there and to get the water I think it's fine if it's like necessary I think that's the whole point like you don't want to be out like drinking and partying and like at a bar necessarily or like even at a restaurant like we got takeout for dinner and stuff like that and you know I feel just so bad for all these local businesses and everything so I just don't know what's gonna go on with them like if it is like a local restaurant in my town or something like I just don't see how they're going to stay in business with these new bands and stuff I know that they just put one in for Boston I think it's for the whole state of Massachusetts the governor did that you can't dine in or drink I guess at any bars or restaurants until April 17th which is over a month away and I understand I'd like it makes total sense and like for precaution purposes it's smart it's just so crazy to me like that's a long time away that's a long time for these businesses to go so I just don't even know what the world is gonna be like I really only packed for like a week to be here which isn't that big of a deal because I'm basically living in leggings and everything anyways still like it's just crazy and kind of nerve-wracking you know when everything starts shutting down it's like what's next thankfully like the grocery stores and all that stuff is still open because you see these things on the news of like other countries that are like in lockdown everything's out and like we don't have enough food and stuff like that stockpiled for weeks like we just don't we're not really doing that like we're kind of just going like a few days at a time yeah we're also not like doing the holy hoarding food and stuff thing I know that's like really controversial too like I don't really believe in that like going to the store and clearing the shelves like just I think that's rude because there's other people that need that sup to so that's a rant for another day anyways that's the update today I think tomorrow morning though my mom and I might take a drive over to just the water and just sit there and relax for a little bit I also have to have podcast and stuff so that will be in tomorrow's clip but I'll see you guys then what time is it yeah it's like 11:00 I'm trying to fix my sleep schedule too cuz I slept in so much today I feel like this has just been a weird time when you're not really leaving your house too much like your sleep schedules off of everything so I'm trying to like remains retain some level like normalcy to my normal like routine that I would do if I were just in Boston or just like living a normal week even with all those going on so maybe that's something that will help but we'll see see you guys tomorrow  hey so much dog content in this vlog happy Monday yeah this is Monday I know I've been like living in the same sweatshirt I just feel like an idiot because my mom told me to pack for an extended period of time when I came home and I was like yeah yeah like I got it and then I really realized that I just didn't even though I'm living in sweatshirts and sweatpants this whole time just because we're not really leaving our house so yeah it's 11 o'clock I'm gonna drink some coffee and sit and watch the news just been living watching the news cuz you know it's important to stay up-to-date on what's going on yeah I'm just gonna sit over there and watch the news and then what else am i doing we're gonna record galas on the go in like two hours or so I think I'm all planned out for that but just posted a video so if you haven't watched my week in my life go watch that no okay let's go sit on the couch I'm sitting my desk right now I literally just brought up this chair from my kitchen to do like a makeshift desk because I just didn't really like the gesture that I had before and I wanted to like get comfortable with my new setup because I'm probably gonna be here for a while this is from the grocery store it's so good I love like the little prepared foods in grocery stores I'm so random fresh Greek orzo salad YUM it's really good I'm probably gonna finish the whole thing we're gonna do takeout again for dinner though you know try to workout later we're about to podcast this theme that we're gonna do it's just kind of like things we're doing like well first it's gonna be like a life update of what Danielle and I are up to because she has classes just cancelled for two weeks and then there's rumors that they might be going online for the rest of the semester which I think like a lot of colleges are doing it's kind of scary I really want to start cleaning this room organizing doing all of these things from home I'm gonna have a lot of time and so we'll see this is delicious though drinking a lot of water wash your hands just did some ads for gals on the go  Wow I literally you guys brought home my function of beauty shampoo and conditioner and I'm so glad that I did so didn't bring home a ton of stuff but at least I got those listening to go  good morning next day look who it is work from home Queen herself swollen been layin low yeah what are your thoughts on everything that's going on we watch the news every pretty much all day but I don't even watch QVC all day yeah you old raisins oh you're a little Bruce on the outside yeah is it yeah it hurts good I sit okay I don't want anything now okay because I have to go work out which is probably actually bad for it but hey Fitness I got some comments that are liquid or Dina's thoughts like what are you guys doing and stuff but you still work but tell me about the changes I guess yeah so there's a lot of changes at QVC it's only essential people so the actual office portion is closed yeah so they're not closed there everyone's working remotely no from home when I'm on air which is just for one of my brands then I'm allowed in the building when I'm just the business side of the brand's which is actually more than when I'm on air I'm not allowed in the building so my guests are there without me Wow no that's why I just said to Lauren who works with me please try to get me on air every time we have other because otherwise the guests are by themselves just it's just very minimal people in there basically it's really it's a closed set basically yes closed set and I'm QVC two one two tape so that you know they eliminated oh yeah so it's very few people but the show must go on so they say yes and it's stressful for everyone isn't everyone I mean yeah like tremendous stress I have like these times where I might not stressed at all and I'm like oh okay and then I'm like Danielle said I passed she was like gosh moment in the morning like when you wake up the first like minute when you forget everything's going on yeah and you're like ah it's a beautiful day and then you're like oh never fun like yeah and it's scary because I don't know if anyone else really knows exactly what's gonna go on like did you see read about San Francisco now yeah they're lockdown yeah yeah it's scary and cookies dressed just quite frankly she doesn't like having everyone home all day yeah my mom works from home mostly when she's home anyway so it's good for that reason I guess I mean thank you that everybody who saw us to work and like you know Danielle said it too like the mail men and women and grocery store employees health care professionals and then even members of like military police everything that are like doing first responders yeah people that are doing the most it's incredible so so thankful but yeah just trying to lay low I feel like go out as little as possible it's like we're just doing everything in like runs of like we've dust that we need things you never know well actually you're supposed to have I saw it in the news today um technically you should have a two-week supply okay a food and that means anything broke down like how many rolls of toilet paper that is for a family of four how many is that it's like a pack of 24 it's like 17 or something yeah that's why you don't need people that are taking 4 packs or whatever I wonder how my Costco is it's cost they're still open yeah I'm very thankful to be home I feel like I totally made the right decision by coming home and especially at the time that I did I think that was really a good move happening so quickly like yeah changing so fast he's on Friday was like do you really need to come home and then it was like literally the next day it was grandma in Florida and she's like everything's fine and I'm like mm I know just a couple of days behind days it's in Florida and Georgia it's a few days behind Oh Georgia went to online classes for the rest of the semester which is so sad I was just texting with Taylor my little because it's just it really is and I note that there's bigger problems in the world but I just put myself in her shoes and if I was a senior in college I would be and no graduation out I think so if you want my my feelings on something that I think is very valid you're allowed to have your thoughts about how it affects you personally and not you know guilty or selfish for that because it's the reality right so if you're affected with graduation or you know or or your senior year or potentially find more jobs that's a crazy thing finding out now the job process is scary so what do you say yeah but sal LaCrosses that might not have a senior year of lacrosse that's like a really big thing when you're a student athlete and you've been waiting your whole life to play your senior year and now maybe that's not happening so yes in the scheme of life it seems so ridiculous to worry about those things but it's not it you're you're like everyone's entitled to have their their own struggles with it I like that right I like the way that you said that yeah it's you shouldn't feel guilty for like your feelings are valid basically yeah the important now can you should you be going on and on it just like that that's the only thing it is no but it's a part of it though yeah and you're a lot to feel that way I mean I know we certainly feel that way about things right I even feel that way about work because I'm more of a workaholic than probably you know I'd like to be but give yourself a break those nice me on the other hand I'm like all out of my routine I'm sleeping in so late I've been sleeping great but just like I don't know what's happening I'm going to work out right now kids yeah we've had Jim in the house so I don't even have an excuse you have to work out it's so good for you mentally yeah not even just Bobby you know me they'll say physical but mental as well I think that's really it for now I made it iced coffee this morning with the Keurig I really want to go to the grocery store and get some like pre-made iced coffee so I don't have to go out it could just like drink it from a jug you know it's not bad it's just not great I think that's it for now
