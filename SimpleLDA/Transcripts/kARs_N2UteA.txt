 I hope I hope that I can look back on this video if you like Wow I was in one of the busiest hospitals in York state during the corona virus what was running through my mind what was I thinking no care system on your screen across the country concern  whole Hospital and the city is in panic mode Kevin ran on the toilet paper Kevin's been using other things like leaves   what's up everyone welcome back to another episode of right now I'm in the emergency call room of our Hospital this is where residents can sleep overnight but that's not what this video is about the belt coronavirus don't worry originally I hadn't intended on making a video about this freaking virus it single-handedly consumed the minds of our entire global population I think the last time that happened was when BTS drop their latest album BTS the group dominates the multibillion-dollar kpop industry I just have to give a shout out to my my BTS brothers I know that you're watching this video guys thanks and this virus has also brought out some of the ugliest behaviors in the human race racism the attack wasn't reported to police but the NYPD's Hate Crimes Unit is asking the victim to come forward selfish boring it all comes from a state of panic a state of uncertainty which brings out fear and when fear kicks in sometimes irrational thinking so I wanted to make this quick video to capture my experience during the corona virus outbreak before I go into my experience in the hospital let's give you a time reference today is March 13th Italy has been in a countrywide lockdown for the past four days President Trump declared a national emergency today people are continuing to buy ridiculous amounts of toilet paper from Cosco toilet people go to Costco later today and I don't know what to expect based on what I see in the media I don't think there's gonna be anything left  this is put this begs the question how serious is the corona virus are we overreacting or is the fear justified infectious disease specialist dr. osterholm who had predicted much of what has already happened very early on said that we should be looking at this as a corona virus winter not as a blizzard he says that we have just begun what will continue to spread many others say that this may be seasonal there are some who say that given China's recent reduction in case numbers we will also follow the same course but simply there are too many variables for us to know exactly these variables are also embedded in our individual behaviors for example in China tells its civilians not to go outside they don't go outside when the u.s. Department of State issued an advisory to reconsider non-essential travel my only friends are booking flights are really cheap saying Yolo might as well see the world  of course there are many of us who are taking this very seriously trying to stay up-to-date alert and trying to do our part to slow this down and for many of us our daily lives our travel plans are our peace of mind have been disturbed so what's it like working in a hospital during the corona virus outbreak I am NOT at the frontlines I'm not taking care of chrono virus patients but the hospital that we work in is one of the busiest New York City hospitals the trauma level-one Center meaning that we don't and we cannot shut down for anything so of course we've had positive cases here we're not that far from one of the epicenter of the outbreaks in New Rochelle New York and we've had staff who have tested positive many of us saw that coming but still that was saddening news and the staff are in quarantine the rest of us though we have to keep working it's not only a more alarming time for us right now our day-to-day work has also been affected how number one patients are stealing stuff masks gloves sanitizers we're not looking the the personal protective equipment the PPE that we need disappearing it's not only the patient's staff it's out of the state of desperation I don't think it's because people want this deal it's because they feel that they have to steal they can't purchase these things are sold out we don't luckily we don't have a shortage many before here but I've heard of clinics not only need or abroad that have run out it's really concerning for the safety of the health professionals if we're not protected nobody else's we do not have enough personal protective equipment you can't get them anywhere in the region or anywhere in Europe you just can't get them yeah impossible to find well if I allow who are not relative to come to the hospital I have to give them these but we do not have this for us well you need them for doctors they cannot receive the relative in hospital so the patients are alone and they die alone hobby - we are rightfully so on hyper alert if a patient comes with fever coughing that stuff may not have been as alarming pre-chorus but because that patient may be now an infection source we have to take proper protocol to minimize their exposure so we have to ask a thorough travel history sometimes patients lie to us in order to get the treatment that they need before we leave if we're all infected I don't know what's gonna happen number three on that note the hospital ministration has told us that if we're feeling sick we should go home they've even built this 14-day sick leave quarantine period if we test positive or our pay is ineffective the problem is if we're not there then who's gonna be treating the patients right and if we decide to just suck it up and ignore the symptoms we could be jeopardizing the health of everybody else so it's tricky we can have good intentions we also have to be smart about how we're handled our own health you said you are upset that you maybe even cry every day and I wonder if story or one patient that made you upset the main problem for us is to treat our colleagues it's doctor we are used to treat patient and for us it's normal there is not so emotional luckily because we are used to treat to other people but this is difficult when the patient is your colleague people who you will meet every day in your life for schools are closing it's good news for kids cuz I won over school who's gonna watch the kids who's gonna pay for daycare one of the biggest complaints of young parents right now it's the fact that they have to take off of work in order to watch kids or the pit can't afford think here it's happening to our staffs kids too so if the staff can't come in same problem how is the hospital everyone but it's becoming a nightmare perhaps the most upsetting thing that has happened recently is an episode of racism in the clinic we have dedicated our lives to helping people in putting ourselves at risk to help people right now a patient had the audacity to tell one of our Asian surgeons one of the most qualified and talented surgeons I've ever met your Chinese I don't want you go grab me at some other doctor luckily our Hospital doesn't condone that kind of behavior so the patient was allowed to leave and find his own provider somewhere else and talk about bigotry coming in here demanding treatment from a non-asian do some research this virus doesn't discriminate New York City I've been hearing so many incidents of racism I get it people are fearful it's a time of uncertainty but man keep your morals intact that stuff just pisses me off that's been my experience in the dental department only imagine how much more difficult that is for departments that are dealing directly with coronavirus patients the emergency department we don't have kits the CDC and the US government has been very slow in rolling out the distribution of testing kits and we should have seen this coming a hospital staff physician is there they've expressed frustration over a lack of preparedness from the government thus jeopardizing the health of more innocent people what makes this even more difficult is that a lot of you guys are working from home or half off from school and you're consuming large amounts of information while you're at home you're watching the news you're watching YouTube watching Jay bro there's a lot of misinformation out there that can fuel more panic and simply being told not to panic doesn't help right it's like telling someone who's hysterically crying to calm down it doesn't do anything while it's not good to panic there are some people who are taking a very relaxed attitude about all the recommendations that have been made man I had a friend who had a fever went bar-hopping I told me was an idiot for doing that it was irresponsible I think until we know more about the situation we have to err on the side of caution because we don't wanna regret and it's hard it's hard it only been like a week since this has really gripped America the school closings large gatherings being canceled concerts it's disturbing not only the economy but our everyday lives it's hard to imagine living out the rest of 2020 like this what's gonna happen people are itching to go back to their lives so man but until then I think it's important that we act responsibly and logically yep stay tuned for more fun episodes this was just me talking it's hard to make a walk about this because I don't know I just feel empty streets and a Costco filled with hysterical people yeah hope you got something out of it in the comments we'd love
