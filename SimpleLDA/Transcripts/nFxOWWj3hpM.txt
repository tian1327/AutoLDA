 it is Wednesday it's 10:00 a.m. I just woke up just made my coffee I just wanted to pop on here and say good morning and welcome you to another day yeah there's my coffee there's my water and have a sip of this then a sip of that use my laptop as a coaster like that is unacceptable behavior what if it fell down I would be devastated and I wouldn't be able to have a new laptop for like five years I was catching up on some YouTube and I found out that Jane Malik and Gigi Hadid are having a baby what is 2020 I always find it so crazy when um like celebrities close to my age like she just turned 25 I'm 24 have babies because I can't imagine having a child right now but also I feel like when you're a celebrity you just grow up in a you obviously grow up in a different way but you like grow up so fast like I remember being young and liking Hilary Duff so much and I feel like she grew up way faster than I did but I think it's because you like watch the shows that are pre filmed and I don't know I'd literally think celebrities grow up like way faster than you do in real time like that kid is going to be like the most beautiful child ever like I thought Miranda Kerr having a baby with Orlando Bloom was like going to be so beautiful and obviously their kid is so cute but um this kid is just gonna be like exceptionally good-looking I just got ready only only half up this will be your secret uh yeah I'm gonna film and April favorites which I'm so excited about I have so many favorites to share and I feel so much better like getting ready I did a full face of makeup just feels good to like play with my makeup and actually have fun with like the application and choosing things and it's just crazy how much of an effect putting on makeup and getting ready has on your day so yeah I feel good I'm very excited to be filming and we're gonna have a great Wednesday that felt so amazing to actually sit down and film a video because I haven't done it and so long and I love love doing it so I'm really really stoked that I filmed my April favorites now I'm gonna tidy up put everything away I'm actually really really hungry because I haven't had breakfast today so I'm gonna have some breakfast and then I will muster up the courage to film my haul I definitely have to do some cleaning today because we got some dishes and the sink we got some clothes that I have to take care of I'm going to have the same thing for lunch that I had for dinner yesterday tuna salad I'm honestly so addicted to this it's so good and if I could kindly get the product on the bread I would feel a little happier I just changed into this little like bra top and putting it on with such a struggle it's if it's fine and if anything the straps are like pretty long it is now 4:30 my throat hurts so much from talking for so long filming honestly I forget how much just energy it needs and I was talking for so long my throat is honestly hurting but I'm very happy to have filmed I love filming you already know this so I'm not that I have ingredients to make this delicious pasta that I'm very excited to make I say delicious like I've had it before I've never had it but I don't feel like pasta which is really rare I typically am so down to just shovel in some carbs so this is the state of my fridge and I think it's time I like organized everything because I literally just tossed everything in there and then also look at this cabinet it is a mess I tossed everything in there I just like didn't organize organize it I decided to finally make this recipe that I've wanted to make for it quite some time that's why I have all the ingredients for it it's a one-pot creamy Tuscan pesto and artichoke pasta so I have laid all the ingredients out I have my pot I'm just gonna prep everything and then I'll show you guys the process I'm going to add the olive oil I may have put a little too much pepper in there this is what we have for now I'm gonna wait until the pasta and that kale cook I will now add everything else so I'm gonna do half a cup of coconut milk the white beans and the artichokes  I have everything in there now I'm just gonna mix it the pasta is nowhere to be found where did it go I just want to make sure that everything is like mixed because everything was on top and we don't want oh you're splattered this all over myself like ten times so far just topped it off with the basil and dill and it's no longer on the heat so I'm gonna mix this up and then it'll basically be ready to consume no chef but I must say this looks good I topped it off with some burrata cheese and obviously some more pepper because I love adding pepper to everything and here is the pasta there it is here it is plated and look at how messy at my kitchen is for now we're gonna eat this and see if it's good okay first bite mmm mmm I like it it's a very pesto II that was a little spicy okay let's get more burrata because we love cheese cheese changes everything I think if you get all the ingredients and every bite it's good but if you just have the linguine noodles then it just tastes like nothing but I do like it it's very it's different I like the pesto aspect mmm this feels a little different because they typically like to have like garlicky buttery heart-stopping pastas this is definitely a little bit more I guess healthy even though there's like cheese and pasta in it it's good though I do like it it's almost 6:30 so I'm gonna log on and do my product development lecture I'm so sad about my product development class like being online because this was my favorite professor ever and now it's it's just sucks not being able to see her and go to class every week because every week she would have so many fun stories and just things related to whatever topic I'm definitely the most devastated and miss this professor the most so I definitely want to do a good job for it this product development class just because she means so much to me and I definitely want to UM just like impress her two semesters ago I had her for marketing and about a hundred percent which is crazy like I got 100% in the class but that's because like I loved her and I just wanted to do such a good job and I really just tried for everything not that I don't try for other things but I tried really hard for everything and I think now proc development being online it's just changed I'm like not as active I it feels like it feels like I don't care as much even though I really do it's just so hard to get that motivation for online school but I also don't want to make any excuses like now I feel good and I'm back on track and school is almost over it's over in like two-and-a-half weeks basically and I just want to kind of like stick it out and she sent me an email and asked me how how I was doing and I thought that was just so sweet and the least I could do is just like do a good job for the next three weeks because I love her and time to log on to the class and eat my pasta before I talk your head off I woke up two hours ago I have been sitting in the exact same spot with my mug of coffee I talked to my dad for like thirty minutes and I've been on Instagram I didn't have Instagram for like a month and a half I want to say I just deleted it and just didn't want to go on it at all so I would now remember why I actually than Instagram every time I go I end up feeling some kind of way and I've had such a problem falling asleep I even take melatonin and I still can't sleep I'm just so scared of the dark and this was never a thing before I could just knock myself out in two seconds and just go to bed no problem and I've always been fine living alone like I've lived alone before tried going to bed at night I've tried going to bed at a 10 11 12 one there's like no way around and I'm just terrified and they I'm like in the covers looking around the night before last night I was good I fell asleep exactly when I wanted to I wasn't scared the night before the night before I was also good so two nights in a row I was good I was happy that's why yesterday I had a great day I was productive I woke up when I wanted to but then last night I thought I made progress and then at 2:00 a.m. my buzzer rang and that was just so eerie to me I was so scared like why is a buzzer ringing the time the buzzer rings as if someone wants to like get in the building and I don't get like who it was and in my head I'm like okay maybe it was like someone who was drunk like going home and you know doubt the wrong thing but then it happened twice and also like why would someone be out drinking right now it's like quarantine but then again I'm like I can't like predict other people's actions and I was so scared and I couldn't fall asleep until like 4:00 a.m. and that's why I woke up so late I cleaned the kitchen the stove and everything those are all the dishes that have to go away here is the organized fridge yeah it just gives me a lot more peace of mind seeing a nice organized fridge and knowing what I have in there and then the pantry I also organized look at all these nuts it just looks so much better I put like my rice and migraines up there and just things I don't really reach for all that much and then I have cans and all my smoothie stuff the oatmeal can't forget the oatmeal and then my coffee tea vitamins that I keep forgetting to shake and all these nuts I want to make a granola very very soon guys it's a lot later now I was doing homework I was mostly just catching up on discussion posts and figuring out firing out some stuff and then I decided to get ready I put on a little bit of foundation and I Skara and eyebrows I've noticed that every day that I do get ready I actually feel so much better so I did that and I'm happy I did that but I also I forgot I have to go to Staples and print off some labels and ship some like Poshmark packages I think I'm gonna have an avocado toast right now and then just go to Staples so I can print the labels and then come back and I have a class after my class I want to work out I mentioned it in my favorites video but I'm obsessed with the class by teryn to me it's like this amazing workout class and I'm just so excited to work out again because I didn't workout yesterday I took it to rest my calves were like burning and I just needed a day because I worked out really hard for two days in a row and I'm like I'm like that I need to take breaks just I can get excited again and it doesn't feel like a chore to work out have a lot schoolwork so I'm going to keep working out of school and it's gonna be a really good productive day even though I feel like the day is like half over but I told you guys how I'm staying up so late so the day is not half over for me I'll be up until 5:00 a.m. if I get deported I'm just gonna take a suitcase full of this everything with the bagel seasoning because this is literally a life changing oh my god this is the empty one that's more like it these are literally the best invention mmm would you just look at it this is the questionable outfit I'm wearing some Lululemon pants my workout shoes we want to do this scarf because I can actually well okay that helped  we are back from our outside adventure everything was good my favorite time of the day has come other than coffee I think I've lost a little bit of weight during this quarantine because I'm like actually working out I do feel a lot better for just showing up and like trying to do something starting to feel the transient energy rising up meeting your body alright stay here    keep in your beds your body is rented breathe in breathe out we're gonna start to step the left leg out and back fleshing it out a little good here we go  four three two flap
