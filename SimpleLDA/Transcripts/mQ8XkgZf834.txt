 what's up guys Clancy and we're on probably day six of this whole quarantine a thing we're about to as a couple go into our first weekend together a quarantine a house that are you go lots going on guys you're gonna see it all in this vlog but obviously if you guys have been watching my videos you know I'm not actually quarantine aying like that I have to go out for my job my TV news reporter so I still have to go to work every day but when I'm not in the field I am reporting home so like I'm kind of freaking for mom it's a really weird situation but Zack has been just flat-out quarantine a which by the way on a serious note is exactly like what you have to in shut down first of all there's nowhere to go right now everything is shut down but it really is so important because if this thing spreads a lot it could kill so many people my mom for example is one of them she has a compromised immune system because of medicine she takes for her lupus rheumatoid arthritis and her multiple connective tissue disorder one of the medicines she had been taking for years she just went off it because she didn't want to be on too many medicines that compromise your immune system and just came out yesterday that that could be like the cure for the coronavirus Cove in nineteen so that's ironic you just live in your best life is it getting old just staying in cuz you are not a homebody I feel like look yeah look we both enjoy like our time in but you love you love socializing look going out yeah I mean the only time I've stepped foot out of this apartment the last three days is when I did jump roping just in the hallway when did you do that last night I thought I heard you opening and closing the door but I was like what is that guy doing where is he going again that was just two feet outside of our apartment I haven't gone outside because it's been raining for now it's burials which could be the next month I'm scared the silver lining of all this is that it brings people closer together such as us right all right give it the video it up though do you feel closer as a couple since this hit very much though it has been interesting like coming home every day to having you here I've been really enjoying it no I think we've talked about it a couple times already that it just gives us more time in the day to actually be around each other which is a good thing something we're not used to is maybe other because they get all night together isn't it so weird to think back though when I used to come home for like the first couple of months living together and go to bed it's a like I went to as you guys know I changed my sleep schedule to split sleeping so I sleep in the day and I can stay up later at night just like split it just two shifts essentially but it's so weird we first moved in together and the entire time of us dating for like the first like it's the first year and however many months I would just go to bed at 6 it's ok on your body it's nicer gross if you did it for health reasons and how can you do this to us I mean it's been nice we're getting to seeing you but I wouldn't tell you not to do it yeah thank you thank you very much thanks for that thanks for caring about me but alright can I have a good weekend together greatly that is the one never like it is oh my god the coronavirus might be able to stop us from going to the gym but it's not gonna stop us from getting a workout in by the way I am such a fraud right now because I have worked out once this entire week a big reason is because I actually injured my shoulder a couple of actually it's been like two weeks by now but also um laziness because I've had this weird thing like I said guys I'm not in quarantine I mean yes over the weekend I'm not gonna be doing anything if I'm gonna do my part but I am so gonna work I am still going out in the world but for some weird reason psychologically I'm like oh we're all we're all working from home we're all are not going to work and I'm saying up way too late cuz I you know I had a mic yup we're all in this together and no I saw I still waking up at two o'clock in the morning you are going to get back on track this weekend we are going to it yet our workout if you guys haven't checked out Blogilates on youtube I highly recommend there are just some Fitness youtubers I don't know like I don't enjoy their workouts I can't explain it but I really really like the way Cassie does your workout so big recommendation if you are also isolating this weekend very exciting news we just left the apartment will free for you it's way more exciting like I walk today oh yeah you did you wonder would you say that a three-mile walk I took it like a three-hour nap we're going to Mayer to get a board game it's gonna be a long weekend with this one so you know find some things to pass the time now oh yeah we have made it to the promised land currently experiencing one of succs biggest flaws oh well sometimes he'll blatantly drive a mile away from the door entrance pass a million spots cuz he wants to park his car away from everyone else that doesn't go to scratch one times a can I shut up somewhere any parked his car really far away from everyone else and I'm like oh my gosh Zach we got out and it's on park spec he's like should I move it YouTube would agree that all other cars think all right you too I also these shoes weren't made for walking kidding if I bought them guys I've never seen such a clean floor in my entire life clearly they are ramping up their cleaning because of the corona but oh my gosh this place is spotless all right guys we have found the boardgame aisle which will be our selection of the evening exactly for this one I've heard some great things actually I don't even know if I've heard great things over nanograms I just feel like I see it all the time what sparkling weird all right guys looks like Quibbler is the winner we know absolutely nothing about it other than that are so cute even Meijer shelves are so empty this is the bread aisle but actually this is probably better than Kroger though nobody like no one's the mood for the Sunbeam giant come on guys you have a chance give her a chance you guys are frauds everyone knows mini muffins is where it's at and there would be no where's Mona in my life and on my dad once every three months he would pick up the blueberry and sometimes I wouldn't even notice and I'd bite into it and I've got a quarter of my chocolate chips good no I wanted the chocolate oh I love donuts powder and chocolate zach is a big Triscuit guy but not the kind I eat he likes the dill sea salt and olive oil which personally not my fav oh yeah that one I try it burns my whole mouth I don't know how you enjoy that I think I'm gonna go for the gold and try a new snack guys I think we're gonna try these cauliflower tortilla chips I don't know I have not I was about to say I've heard so much about them I've heard nothing about them so that's a lot right there but I know they look interesting grain okay show everyone you have sex hungry shopping right now we got no my god you under the favorites of all time oh I've never had those but you say I could talk to you about that I'm like a million times you should get one for the heck of it oh yeah yeah you don't need to tell me this I'm so happy for you you talked about it so much who's not planning on getting anything he's planning on just getting board games and then this happens the quran virus is slowly but surely eating our bank account we just wanted to meyer for a quick board game and we spent $65 that's not not ideal but next up on the list is my mom is currently quarantine and it looks like she's doing a lot worse than us we have to say to Kathy yeah I hope you get your dog Wow oh my gosh we gotta pause her puppy I wanna go home like to see it but my mom doesn't want me there she said she's scared I'm gonna get her sick all right we have secured the goods this is Zach's youjin bull he gets brown rice salmon tuna avocado and a bunch of other stuff and I but boom brown rice chicken avocado cucumber and carrots excepts I asked the guy for a little bit of sweet soy sauce Zac how much did he add I'm like it's like you wanted me to be upset even if you wouldn't normally tip your restaurant or fast-food workers for like pickup and to go orders obviously you took a few sat down tip them right now they need it restaurants need it so many restaurants probably aren't going to make it out of this because the restaurant industry is one of the most difficult industries to survive in like you might be I read an article today restaurant that's making a million dollars the the owner will only actually walk away with about 40,000 yeah definitely tip your workers and then we got a little great section here a little carrots also I got candle lighters so that we can have a bunch of nice romantic nights in where we light some candles cafe au fresco or vanilla cupcake vanilla cupcake he never goes for the CAF al fresco by the way a little bomb scenes that you guys didn't just say Zach had to light the candle cuz I got scared I'm like really scared of fire and I can't use these kinds of lighters like it's just too scary for me I need like the long stick to be like socially distance we're about to watch little fires everywhere which I'm so excited about I was about to see we have our fusions zach already ate as he was starving and now he's eating a zebra cake oh my gosh let's see the bite I'm sorry guys for the lighting and I'm gonna have my gallon of soy sweet soy sauce and my fusion and my king like his coffee I'll set it down right here oh shoot guys I just woke up I slept more than 12 hours last night I went to bed before 10:00 and I woke up after 10 this never happens but I'm telling you I have been so dead this week and I woke up and I didn't even regret a minute normally I'm like oh my gosh Jimmy dude you visited do that there's nothing to do so no case you're wondering I don't regret it we always set the bed so nicely but when I want to lay in bed and do stuff on my laptop and whatnot I can't have all these pillows here so I end up just knocking them over and putting this thing on cuz it's so comfortable but Saturday mornings are my favorite because I just uploaded a new video as I do every Saturday morning at 10:00 and senior guys's comments it just having it alive is my favorite thing in the entire world so that is what I'm about to do with my water and my tea of course and you'll notice I can iron out together right now we're trying to add a little bit of separation to this quarantine for 72 hours together so I think it's definitely healthy for us as a gal who normally wakes up at 2 o'clock in the morning the fact that I am just now eating breakfast at 11:40 is its I don't even know how to say what even is happening Zach made me a nice little protein shake this morning / it's practically afternoon but that is what we are gonna be enjoying also if there was ever a time that vitamin Jo was necessary it is now so I will be taking my vitamin D pill guys I am so sad because I'm just now realizing up until this point my camera was on some weird glitchy setting that probably made this entire video not too fun to watch and I I think I solved it I'm not very technologically savvy it's the truth and I apologize so much like my perfectionist on a very tight bag perfectionist height person is like just delete all the footage you don't put it up but I love everything we already did and we're just gonna let a bra and in case you're wondering what that sound is we have the office on and when I say we I mean he like perfectionism is just like an excuse to not put things up or not put things out there and we are not gonna delete anything it's all in the vlog maybe it was a little weird to watch forgive me alright guys it's time and it was inevitable boom Zach and I are gonna do a little bit of cleaning cuz what else is there do in this world but it reminded me of a funny little story that I thought we would share and arguments that can I got into once upon a time I'm waiting for him to come in here because he's gonna share it with us as well we're gonna try to tell both sides equally but I think we all know who's gonna be you know come out on top of this one who is correct but seriously go comment down below you think it's correct after we tell the story one great thing to do in quarantine is to reminisce and share some stories and this one is a particular funny one when you say yeah I think so I think those are the good alone it was make sure you know I don't want to steal the spotlight even though today sometimes Zack decided he really wanted to clean I guess I just remember that I started cleaning and you were just sitting around and I was wanting us to clean they never told me that yeah but usually it's like if I see you starting to pick up burp I see it never happened you picking up I know you're crap for if he's worth vacuuming I think I was natural Beco do you want help but you've just cleaned like when I haven't been here and what not the point of the story was I was cleaning by myself and Clancy had been work worked all week everyone not we didn't talk about cleaning and she wasn't in the mind space to want to clean and I was getting frustrated because I just wanted help so I think the moral story was that I should have done a better job communicating and yeah I think you could have helped I just recently I mean just five seconds ago we're gonna clean our place today and I wanted to do one chore beforehand I want to go to Meyer and you're right now it's cleaned out I was like can I please just go to Meyer first yeah I know I know so I'm sound because we talked about like so you should have just started cleaning like I did and then I would have been me you in that scenario frustrated because I wanted to go do something more you just wanted to relax in that scenario because you've been working all week from my perspective I had worked seven days that week and I came home on Sunday it was more than seven days then all I know is I was pulling in over the weekend so I was working a lot of days in a row came home on Sunday at two o'clock which is later you guys know I normally wake up at 2:00 a.m. but the Sunday shift is later so I was already coming home later and I didn't have really much of a night I was exhausted and Zack just randomly started cleaning but he didn't say anything he didn't say like oh hey I'm cleaning or like I'm gonna do that so in my mind I'm just sitting in the bedroom at this point I think it's like four or five probably and I only have like an hour due left of this world before I have to say goodbye to it and go to sleep I was thinking I'm like oh in my perspective I'm like that's so sweet of Zack but he knows how much I've been working it he's like doing the girls but I was doing it first I know but I know I been cleaning already for a while in my head I was like he doesn't even want me to help like he's doing this for us and I was like oh my gosh and I was like taking pictures of him in like field which I know made you mad but in my mind I was like all that can be recognized but he's doing and I like post of them saying like oh like that's so nice anyway but Zack I could tell you was mad because every time I was like trying to talk you just be like really quiet and I was just like what's happening is he mad at me and then it turns out yes and I understand I'm just sitting on my butt in bed well he's doing all the work I think we learn the lesson that we need to like make sure we're both ready and also only need to make sure we're both doing the help because looks like real I haven't cleaned in like months at that point so but I think we both cleaned individually multiple times so yeah it's not like one does it more than the other I was just a funny scenario with timing many newbies that are now living together good luck with your cleaning maybe careers forever so you heard it we're gonna go to Meijer see if we can get some workout equipment okay my arm will be huge I promise it but you want it to look like this biceps biceps the organ am I really for you like I you oh my leg own like bodyweight stuff you might not have a gym for 500 years really there's no telling so I've already bought dumbbells I think the nervous thing it's like am I just buying all this like weightlifting equipment for no reason if this could pass in a Mont or is it gonna be three months if it's gonna peak May 1 we that's another month and a half if that's peaking then there's no way people are going to the gyms the Daedric yeah May 2nd and of course we were trying to do our part and stay in as much as possible but obviously what we total get like groceries and things like this that's okay I've only been out once in three days yes yesterday momentum iron future that was my first daughter big outing yeah she still hasn't turned on the vacuum yes not in your presence you're the virtue still nor the night person who has to clean in front of me to be like look I do it when you're not here God there are two days of people in this world so there you have it folks we are literally going to the same place went to yesterday this this is the quarantine life when you're allowed out of your cage to do some necessary things also by Coronis water wow this is part of the workout section at Meijer people really came for those dumbbells I just want everyone to know that can I just did a Kroger shopping experience Zach got complimented on his sweater you're welcome the guy said whatever he said to Zach and I wanted to pop in there and be like thank you what do you say oh man guys just a sec he looks he looks so sick also I thanked one of the workers for his hard work did you yeah I bought a guy tic tacs the other guys it whispering cuz he's on he's working and I'm in the self-checkout and I'm like when I'm working and I was like sure so I skate another checked out he's like oh wait we put your Kruger plus card in it it'll give you a discount because it was tic tacs it was like a dollar fifty maybe I think he thought I was gonna go down to a dollar can you set a buck in his hand it did in the dollar fifty and he had like a Warner five and he's like oh gosh you could tell he didn't know what to do or stop shooting of asking about something but not a big deal my experience of the Kroger worker was he was like hey are you finding everything okay I was like oh yeah I'm finding everything great and I was like thank you so much for doing what you're doing I know how stressful it must be in anything Thanks I was like no problem buddy because we've heard so many stories on the news lately of just people like freaking out on Kroger employees or wherever it might be oh my gosh you don't have this you don't have this and it's like chill they'll get it in stock they're doing the best they can anyway they just makes me so mad so thank your local grocery store employees they're going through a lot right now cooking party Zach and making his little pasta right now a little gonna feel a little witch love your little witches brew I'm making a little salad thing I'm not spent on the dressing but I always find it so funny of like what the serving size is versus what everyone actually does so I'm actually gonna try to do the right serving I don't know if this is an exact tablespoon but if that's like one and then two I am a mom kid boom all right and that's what two tablespoons looks like now we shall sit all together go outside deal so like Italian doing this or just like professional weight professional stir everything I'm doing this vlog is just because quarantine sorry guys this is the content you're good allegedly Zach says that there is a pasta test to tell if it's cooked all the way possibly if you take your pasta when you throw it against the long sticks that's good oh it's good no it's good yay town for the big Knicks you just made pasta watching the original Shrek who are playing a nice little game of Quigley my grandpa wouldn't let you play cards unless you knew how to shuffle really yeah that sounds like I would never play all right Zach beat me twice and a little game of Quibbler law update I hate you but a little word of advice ladies it's really nice boyfriends are smart and can play with you sometimes going for the ugly guy really does pay off gets called you ugly  zach is stressing cuz he said he's gonna cook dinner for us tonight some I love to touch anything she cooks more so she's allowed to boss me around yeah that's the funniest thing so I'm the one who knows like what to do and so cute he's like

get out of the house right now I mean well I have to get ready for a very busy day at work tomorrow because I feel like the world kind of stops more and more for everyone else it like ramps up in the
