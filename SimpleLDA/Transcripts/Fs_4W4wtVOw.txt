 hey guys welcome back to my channel so in today's video I thought I would do a little quarantine day in my life today's actually a little different from any other day because I actually had to leave my house today so I'm currently in the car right now we're on our way to the city because I have to go to a doctor's appointment so yeah I thought I would just take you guys along with me and I'm with my mom and my brother so my brother's coming because he's gonna take care of the car so yeah anyways I'll keep you guys updated I don't know what's gonna happen today and yeah so I'll talk to  okay I so just wait till my desk you look like a look women hi    oh actually the only reason I knew my ductus was open today was because I've been on like phone calls with her like video calls so I knew she was gonna be open today but um yeah there was like really nobody there like I'm sure that scheduling patients out like really far in between times just said there's like nobody there like at the same time so yeah there was like nah I think there was only one person there waiting but that's about it so that's pretty good um I think she mentioned that she's only gonna be in the office like two days a week or something like that so yes slowly everything is gonna start getting back to normal hopefully sinkage is really out of hand and wearing gloves and mask everybody I just have it right here because I just took it off while I'm in the car but just in general it's really annoying to have it on all the time while you're talking to people which is really uncomfortable but that's just what we're living in right now so yeah alright guys so I'll talk to you guys once I'm home  hey guys so we're home now now we're gonna eat you salute looks so good we have we're putting we put the fries into the oven just to warm up a little because it's a little cold so talk to you guys in a bit once we're finished eating oh sorry it was an accident anyway so the last thing that you guys saw I think was when I was eating chili and then after that to the knob  yeah 33 almost 6 p.m. so to the map and then premature have been sitting down I'm working on the library now that I have to do to me like she have to love students so I'm working on that okay I'm gonna go to that soon so I made a joke yesterday I made pasta yesterday so and I say some of the job because it was too much so if they wouldn't do that afterwards after finished just like we're gonna do that she might ramen are gonna have lunch that's pretty much it for now I'm gonna work on my lap for a bit and then I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna show you guys that dough is so cool it was the first time ever that I made pasta which was really nice so I'm going to show you guys that afterwards when I'm done with this and yeah I'll tell you guys in a bit  you see I best part of the day is here  so you don't get seem to the weekend hey guys so it's literally a rating 9 p.m. and I'm still sitting here mints in here for like four hours like four or five hours already obviously I've taken like some big water breaks and stuff but manages to focus because onto this lava stick over dude I have two labs that are kind of overdue one is actually due today and the other one was done Friday but I didn't do it so I'm finishing up those now and then afterwards I'm still gonna make my pasta on my time and I already have to do so I chopped it just um cut it up and just make it it's already gamely so this probably this isn't due until like midnight so I'm just gonna finish up like what I'm doing right now and then I'm gonna go make the pasta I'm gonna show you guys you guys can see it I definitely recommend you guys making at home even if it's just one sick he'll experience was like really cool so if you guys are into like looking into stuff I definitely recommend you make homemade pasta I think you'll really enjoy it and not even got the taste was actually really really good I'm a little tired of sitting here but this is already like the end of the semester it's only like living like two classes like two weeks left of classes so so I'll show you guys when I'm cutting us you guys can just see a little bit of it okay guys so in my kitchen now and this is a double so I just have a rest in here because I had it in the fridge so they just said to leave I read online and you said to leave it off for like 20 minutes so I just left it I with a little bit of flour so now I'm just gonna show you guys how I roll it it's already pretty warm and it's so soft as you guys can see so it should be easy to roll out so I'm gonna show you guys how I roll it out and then how I cut it so you guys have an idea I actually didn't film me doing this just because it was like the first time but if you guys wanna can definitely make it like a small video and show you guys how I do it so it should technically be like you kind of like see your hand through it that's when you know that it's kind of ready to be cut up I've been always just like folded up a little bit like this you just remember to add a little bit of flour so it can be easier to just roll out you really want to make it thin because once you put I mean once you put it into the boiling water it does get thick so that's what you really want this to be really thin  alright guys so it's pretty much under the night already it's almost like 11 p.m. so it's
