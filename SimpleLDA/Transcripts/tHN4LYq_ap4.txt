 hello everyone my name is David Santiago and welcome to my first video so for today's video I'm gonna be doing a little quarantine vlog showing what I do every day during quarantine if you're not from Ohio basically I live in Ohio and we're on the stay at home order right now so we can't leave our houses and less it's basically for something essential so go into the grocery store I guess going to like the doctor's the ER if you have to getting food stuff like that you're allowed to go outside for like exercise going on a walk stuff like that bein not really supposed to be in contact with other humans so with that all of my schooling I am in college all of my schooling is online now and I'm at home the whole day and I also don't have a job right now so and a lot of my friends are in the same position so I thought I would do a little vlog to show what I do in a day and show how I try to stay productive right now it's about noon I like just woke up I just threw on a hoodie in some pants and yeah I'm gonna show you what I do today so hope you enjoy okay y'all step one of my day in quarantine you know what time it is Baptist and there you go here is my finished product today I'm not a chef so I just made a bagel some sausage I'm eating some yogurt with it and drinking some coffee as well to wake me up because I did not get much sleep last night okay so breakfast is done so unfortunately that means it's time for school oh my god my setup for school right now I just have my laptop and my hydrofloss um I have my laptop because like I said everything is online so this is really all I need I don't even have like a book bag or papers or anything and then I have my water I'm trying to drink a lot of water every day my skin could use all the helping yet so yeah I'm just going to work on some schoolwork for however long that takes and then I will talk together blog so school work is done for the day and I'm so bored I didn't know what to do so I said you know what we're gonna go on a ride let me drive a bull so here we are and yeah I'm just gonna be driving on my neighborhood jammin out a little bit and  I does it ever drive you crazy just how fast in the back in nobody roti night so I don't really have anything else to do for the rest of the day so I think the next thing that I'll probably do is grab something to eat and then I will talk to you guys though it's actually a really beautiful day outside right now so I decided to take my dog on a walk so I can get some vitamin D and why are you running with driving so we had a very successful walk Dexter is very tired so I think we did it right so as you can tell I changed my clothes I'm just wearing a t-shirt and shorts now because I'm about to workout I just ate dinner with my family a little bit ago so I didn't film that but yeah the next thing that I'm going to do today is exercise I've been trying to work out like four times a week ish and that's something that I highly advise I mean I literally have a full day of nothing a full day of being home not having to go to work not having to physically go to school so I try to stay active every single day somehow and I think it's very important to do that because otherwise I'll just be laying watching Netflix scrolling to my phone which I already do for so many hours of the day anyway so might as well at least have like an hour of physical activity so that is what you will see me doing in a little fun fact about me before we get to me working out is that actually I only started working out probably like two months ago and it's just because it became on your goal of mine I want to work on my body I'm very skinny and I want to gain a little bit away a little bit of muscle so I always make my protein shake and by BCAAs which I don't really know what it is but like one of my friends who like helps me out with working out and gave me like a lot of tips told me that that would help me like gain weight and stuff and the other ones like for energy I think or whatever so I always make those before I workout so they're ready when I've done and then right when I'm done working out I drink those but if there's any other skinny legends out there I need some help now you know my tips and tricks so catch my summer body also not sponsored  for the vlog today I hope that all of you enjoy getting a little look into what my life is like during quarantine if you did enjoy the video please like it comment down below what other types of videos you would like to see and make sure to subscribe to my channel and turn on vacation study you can see the next time that I post also follow me on instagram my instagram is david dot a santiago I'm a lot more active on there I go live on there sometimes so definitely do that and thanks again everyone for watching and I hope everyone has a good night and stay safe bye
