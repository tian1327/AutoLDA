  hi everybody welcome back to my channel so this is a vlog for my second week of Nursing in The Cove in nineteen you so I mean we're still seeing a lot of people that are passing away unfortunately you know we are doing everything for them I do believe that the hospital is doing everything that they can and doing everything right even patients who have become DNR's we have still been trying to save them really they had just become DNR's for various reasons whether it was their family members or them making the decision because they felt like they weren't going to live past this and then you know now they're intubated but even the patients that are DNR's we're not just saying like oh you know this patient's going down we're going to let them die we're still doing everything that we can and you know giving them the medicines epi atropine whatever we need to try and make these people live but unfortunately it's not always working out this past week I did see a patient that had gone extubated and sent to the floor and you know we were really hopeful and then two shifts later the patient actually had to come back down and get reintubate 'add so it is really hard for these people's lungs to survive and it is it's scary you know these people are people that are my parents age they're 55 60 you know and we do have a lot of older patients too but it's just like the amount of younger patients that are intubated and they're really fighting for their lives and unfortunately not making it despite everything that we're doing is scary and it's sad you know the family members call they tell us that they're praying for their family members and they also tell us that they're praying for us which is really nice but honestly it's just a sad situation all around but we're gonna keep doing our best and keep fighting one positive thing that happened this week that I probably keep with me forever is um I was running a little bit late to work so you know they normally clap for health care workers at 7 p.m. and but normally you know we're all getting on the bus or getting ready to go to work so we're not actually out there to hear it or at least not for me and since I was running a little bit late and I was like running to the subway so I was still above ground and the clock struck seven p.m. and I heard somebody like there's a nurse cheer for her or like out their window and then and then like a bunch of people just like started cheering for me and like hanging out their windows and like clapping like at me and just like yelling at me like thank you thank you and there was this little boy and he yelled thank you nurse thank you and it was just so cute and it was really thoughtful but me being as awkward as I am I didn't know like do i way back do i start crying because that's how i felt like i was so happy and so appreciative that they were like you know taking the time to clap for me and thank me that like me specifically you know like that's because they saw me that I just felt like crying but I didn't but I also just felt like oh my gosh get me out of here at the same time because I don't like being put on the spot like that because I don't feel like I'm a hero and I don't feel like I need to be thanked like that but it's really nice and appreciate it and I'm very appreciative that people feel that way about nurses and health care workers in general okay and then that night or I guess the next morning from work on the way home I actually had some guy come up to me and he was like hey you know I was in the Armed Forces in the service and people would always say to me you know thank you for your service but now it's your time and I just really want to thank you for your service because he saw me in my scrubs and I was like oh you know thank you so much I mean it's really nice that people are doing that but I'm just like super awkward when it comes to that stuff but I do really appreciate when people take the time out of their day to do that stuff and to thank us because it is a really hard job that we're doing right now and it's it is rewarding but it doesn't feel rewarding right now because we're seeing a lot of death and it is getting better but it's getting better slowly and these people are still coming in sick we had a trauma come in and we scanned his lungs and he had kovat and he had no idea and his lungs were all junky so it's still out there it's still coming in and yeah otherwise in my personal life not the most compliments that I've ever had in my life about me having a nicely shaped head so that's been very interesting and um it was actually a little bit warm outside the other day so I was able to actually take my beanie off and let my hair go free that my bald head go free and it felt really good otherwise you know I'm feeling good I caught a cold the other day for like two days I had a cold because I I was walking home from the subway and it was pouring down rain and I forgot my rain jacket and I was like thirty degrees so I caught a little cold I know um my family was concerned like oh my gosh did you catch Cove it and although I'm working around it I'm very meticulous about my PPE and taking it off putting it on like I clean all my stuff after every room I wash my hands I washed my goggles everything my face shield I changed all my stuff because the New York Health Hospital systems has enough PPE for us to do that so I'm really thankful for that but um it was just a little cold because I was not prepared for this weather but I have my rain jacket and my warm clothes which I will start bringing to work because it you know New York weather is like very similar to Florida I mean not as far as like how cold it gets but as far as how bipolar it is because literally I'll be going to work and I'll be like 60 75 degrees and sunny outside and I'll be going home from work and it's 30 degrees and raining like I didn't expect that at all so why would I think to bring a jacket but I really just need to be better about checking the weather and about bringing stuff to protect me so that I don't get sick so I can take care of these patients and keep fighting for them so that's all for week two and I'll just keep doing weekly video updates so thanks for watching
