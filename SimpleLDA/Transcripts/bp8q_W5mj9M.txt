  hello it's Justin and this video is about New York City during the corona virus pandemic and how empty the city is compared to business as usual so it's the afternoon is pretty sunny and I've worked out in the morning I'm taking a walk because I've been indoors a lot during the past week and it gets boring being indoors all the time so I wanted to take a walk and show you the city and show you how the city is going during this time and I think this only happens maybe once in a lifetime for the city to be this empty and this different than it usually is so I wanted to take this opportunity and take a walk and not be stuck at home all the time and there's also not a lot of people around the streets are pretty empty you can see this street is pretty empty and behind me is Fifth Avenue in Central Park that looks pretty empty and usually these this area is packed so there's not a lot of people I can catch the coronavirus from and everyone's take keeping their distance from each other so I don't know not very worried but I'm going to show you the city and show you how New York is faring during this very special and unusual time  so I'm at Columbus Circle but unfortunately it's closed except for the Whole Foods inside where and there's a huge line for that right now actually not that huge you're letting everyone in but everything else in Columbus Circle is closed the coach store behind me that is closed as well and basically if you want to get in the only place you can go here is Whole Foods so I'm not gonna go in line I don't need to buy groceries I have ordered meal prep and I bought groceries already from the Whole Foods closer to where I live so I'm gonna skip that and show you some other places in New York so guys we're at Park Avenue I'm walking towards Grand Central and I also wanted to talk to you to you about what this channel is about because some of you might be new to my channel I talked about how people can build wealth how they can get smarter and how they can improve themselves and master their lives so it's really a self-improvement Channel and it's a lot on how you can be the best version of yourself and achieve the goals you want to achieve but this vlog is more about New York because I live in New York City and this pandemic only happened once in my life of course there was Ebola and there was the swine flu but compared to this it's nothing like there wasn't a lockdown when but the Ebola or swine flu happened and this was one of the biggest things that happened during my time in New York in terms of the global scale and how much it affected people so it's pretty cool to talk about that and to show you how the city is because I don't think it's gonna be like this ever again after this is over so it's a once-in-a-lifetime moment and I also want to show you guys parts of my life so this is the first vlog I'm doing and it's cool I think I want to of course I want to talk about all this self-improvement stuff building wealth getting smart making money mastering your life but I also want to get to know you guys and I want you guys to get to know me so that's why I'm also doing some vlogs on this channel  okay guys so we're at Grand Central and it's a lot emptier than it usually is it's very empty right now usually this place is full of people hustling and bustling and going to their trains and subway stops so I'm very taken aback by this because this isn't usual for New York and for those of you who don't know New York City that much Grand Central is probably the busiest train station and subway station in New York up there with Penn Station and first place is also very historical millions of people pass through this station probably every day if not every week actually I meant to say every week if not every day actually so it's a very busy place usually but now it's empty this video I'm going to show you around the city and I also want to give you some background information because I know not all of you are from New York and not all of you are familiar with New York guys this is the first time in my life where I have an entire subway carriage to myself it's literally except for me so that's pretty cool this is also the cleanest I've ever seen in subway because I think people are cleaning it every night now it is affecting everything so it's always pretty clean and it's very different from what it is usually that's pretty cool I'm on the 7 train right now heading to Hudson Yards which is one which is one of my favorite places in the city and I'll show you how that looks like right now    so unfortunately Hudson mall is closed but there's other places in the city to explore probably most things are closed I'm actually walking towards the High Line and that looks closed right now so I don't think I'll be able to show you guys a High Line at least not on the High Line I can show you the High Line from below and kind of film upwards so you can see the High Line but basically it's closed and also downtown by the way this is downtown but downtown is my favorite place of the city because even though I live on the Upper East Side which is a pretty nice place but it's very residential and there's not a lot of young people I usually hang out downtown because that's where all the young people are all my friends are that's where we all go to hang out and there's also the busiest part of the city and the most crowded usually I think that has changed because of the coronavirus so I want to see how downtown is so my plan is to head down to Chelsea and go to Union Square as well and then I'll head down to Washington Square which is where NYU is and maybe go to Soho Tribeca Battery Park which has amazing views and I'll show you all that so that's the plan and this is the High Line so I don't even have to go down to show you what the High Line is like this is the High Line and it's completely empty  okay by the way this is my favorite Apple store in the whole world because I used to live in New York as a kid for six years and when I was a kid that was when the iPhone was first invented and it first came out the iPad first came out and that's when Apple became very popular and I used to go to this Apple store all the time to check out all the new gadgets it brings back a lot of memories because I used to go here to check out the iPad and iPhone and play games on the apps and it was really cool because we never had that when I was a kid until it was invented so this is where it all happened and it also inspired my love of Technology a lot because I'm a big fan of Steve Jobs and I'm a big fan of Apple and I came here all the time to check out the new technology that came out so this store and Chelsea is something that is sentimental to me and it's cool not on passing buy it right now and actually since I hang out in this area a lot I actually pass by this place a lot and that I love that  so we're at Union Square which is a square in New York and it's a major place because a lot of people switch subway stations over here and it's usually like the rest of New York packed with people but it's not today and it's not during the corona virus pandemic but I wanted to show you guys Union Square and it's a really cool place as well because there's a lot of shops in a lot of places here it's a very popular place you bump into a lot of people and right here where I'm walking through right now there's usually a sort of farmers market and a market place they don't just sell food they sell all kinds of stuff over here but I only see about three people or three tents selling stuff and usually this whole place is lined up with tents so that's a very big change from usual but yeah it's not life as usual so we just have to adapt to it and I think being adaptable is very important and very essential to living life because things always change there's always going to be things that are not in your control and you just have to be adaptable and adjust to new situations  so the good news is that the Barnes & Noble at Union Square is still open and that's very cool because this is one of my favorite Barnes & Nobles and for my subscribers and for the people who know me I'm a big reader so I like checking out bookstores and I like reading books and I'm just happy that as far as a noble is still open so let's check it out  you    so we just left Union Square and I'm heading towards Washington Square which is another major place people go to congregate it's also where NYU is so there's a lot of students over there usually but because of this pandemic I think they're they have been sent home like a lot of other schools have done so let's see what Washington Square is like so by the way another big bookstore and very popular bookstore in New York is called strands bookstore and it's right across the street from me on the way from Union Square to Washington Square Park and it's where all the trendy people and fashionable people go to buy books it's a very hip place and there's a very hip vibe to it so if you ever come to New York or if you live in New York I suggest you check it out  alright guys we're at Washington Square Park you just got to see most of the park basically and you got to see the famous arch which was built for George Washington I think and this is a really cool place for New Yorkers to come and congregate it's a really nice place especially in warmer times and in the summer so it's very cool and it's nice to see how it is right now because it's actually very chill there's not a lot of people here but there's still people here and I think that's cool and people are talking to each other approaching strangers meeting people and it's cool   hey guys I'm at a rooftop met up with my friend Chris behind me over there and we're gonna head to Soho soon so see you there but Chris do you want to say anything to the camera now this is Chris phrallan Screen Actors Guild how you doing lips aka Quizzle choreography I go a little bit too much everything what are you gonna do I'm gonna slow down and piano piano baby it's all about piano Pia I could help yeah he's a cool guy so we're gonna head to Soho see you there  we're at soho right now I'm on Houston Street and I'm walking towards Broadway so Broadway is where it's a main area of Soho right now it's empty because of the pandemic usually there's people all over Broadway and Soho in New York is where people go for shopping it has all the really high-end stores all the luxury stores and also the regular stores like H&M and Zara and Bloomingdale's and you combine that with high-end stores like Louie Vuitton Prada Dior who go boss Gucci and this is where people go to buy clothes so I'm walking down Broadway as you can see I'm one of the only people on the streets my friend Chris behind me is also here but otherwise we have the streets to ourselves basically and this is insane because I've never seen Broadway so empty and I'll show you some footage of Broadway and I'll show you some footage of Soho so you can see for yourself and this is also a really cool area it's one of my favorite areas in New York I go here a lot to hang out so there's nice food places nice restaurants coffee shops so let's jump to the footage   I'm at Battery Park right now all the way in and this is a very nice Park I when I live in New York as a kid I used to come here a lot say basketball over there you can't I don't think you can see it but there's a basketball courts over there and it just has an amazing view so behind me is the Hudson River and behind the Hudson River is Jersey City where there's a lot of office buildings and also apartment buildings and other new developments so this part of the city is very very nice it's also very very tranquil because it's not a place where people let go for shopping or whatever it's a more residential area but is also part of the financial district so it's very near the offices of a lot of financial companies like Goldman Sachs which is up over there back behind me if you can't see it but it's fine a few buildings that are being are blocking the view right now but anyway this is a financial district but this is the residential part of the financial district its Battery Park City it's where a lot of people live so they can commute or not even commute to their jobs and offices nearby and it's one of the most peaceful and tranquil parts of the city in my opinion this is where I go to relax  so that is the vlog I hope you guys enjoyed it please like and comment and subscribe and hit the bell notifications and obviously you can see that New York has been very affected by the pandemic a lot of people are taking precautions or at home the streets are pretty empty of course precautions are important safety is important but it's also important to not be stuck in your home the whole time and taking a walk and taking some fresh air because I think that's healthy so I hope you guys enjoyed this video and got to see New York during the pandemic also follow me on Instagram where you can DME and follow me on medium where I write about the same
