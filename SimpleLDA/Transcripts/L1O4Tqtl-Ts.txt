 good morning guys it's 6:00 a.m. and today is going to be more of a vlog style video I just woke up and she's not worn I scare yesterday because it's all over my eye but um I'm going to be doing like a little like vlog swim with me I know like not a lot of people are gonna like watch this probably because it's like so angry but I feel like this is gonna be fun to film for me anyway so I want to do it and yeah so I'm gonna take you guys to the pool with me disparate know that I don't have crap all over my face the reason that I wanted to film like a swim vlog is because this is gonna be like my first actual like swim that's a practice back in the pool and I just ride my practices like for myself that's what I was doing the first like two months of quarantine so that's what I'm doing today I've got on back into my pool like twice since it reopened I just did some easy lob so many stray something so this is going to be interesting I hope you freakin peed on the floor last night time to keep that up first I already pooped on my rug is so cute    okay we are at the pool and ready to spoon it's really early and I'm still trying to comprehend that I did it this early because during with the afternoons in the evenings if we'll get super busy and it's like forth so it's 6:00 a.m. there's there's still one other person a little but I think it'll be fine and I'm gonna be honest Michael is really bad for life so I mean it's not straight the walls are like curved so this is gonna be a well here's the one that I'm gonna be doing it's not meant to be super hard but it's just once I get my body moving and like he's just forming stuff again you know   just forget how everything's caps it's not cute  this is gonna be rough okay let's get in   there some advice don't wanna come to terms with the fact that I can't assassinate work  y'all can't even swim straight in this pool I'm always okay so for warmup I have a 800 I'm just gonna do that the pool is empty now waste is good I literally was not something fast like I was just warming up I was actually do my 800 through my shoulders are you so  can't not it was great thank you guys you're movin with don't care about you I feel like I shouldn't mention the fact that I'm not running any of this fat like I'm just like doing a little bit of everything again so I'm just like not doing these on intervals I thought I would be like so motivated to something but like I'm is like having my to me so I don't know that much  over this the Sun is coming around not have to science like your get tan I'm so pale like I think my skin got three shades lighter in quality okay okay guys I have like a thousand meters left I need to be home in like ten minutes because I'm so angry to be slow and also talking to the camera so I've been at the pool for like an hour now and I haven't even so I'm 3,000 degrees so battery's kind of trash I'm super grateful don't like my pool is open obviously because I know so many people right now don't have that especially in the US and like also where I live some places so I'm a bit but just not feeling being in the pool by myself I don't know I've never really had to like train by myself before so it's really boring I guess yeah anyway so I only have like ten more minutes I'm just gonna cool down I've been cooled down this whole time but I'm just gonna do like eight fifties yeah we'll do a fifties which is what I'm supposed to be doing now anyway so I'm just gonna make it my cooldown      hey no comeback okay y'all I'm gonna go showers I look like this anymore hey guys so it's obviously a lot later in the day shower got ready and absolutely like did my makeup four ones which I never do but my friend and I are going to be filming a video together it's gonna be like a girl talk chitchat kind of video which will be up soon so I hope you guys will watch that one too anyways thank you guys so much for watching this video and I was like really short and that wasn't all going on but I really enjoyed filming it for you guys if you would like to see another video like this where I do like some underwater shots just let me know if you could please like and subscribe to my channel I post new videos every Monday and Friday and sometimes even more and I'll see you guys in the next one bye
