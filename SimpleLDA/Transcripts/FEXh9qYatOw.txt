Louis Missouri so I'm really out here in the Midwest can't say I love it here but I'm very lucky to have a home to come home to and get out of my 7 by 9 room in my apartment where I would not be able to do any kind of movement New York is also kind of dangerous and scary right now things are closed I mean things are closed everywhere nobody should be going anywhere but it's definitely a lot scarier in New York I'd say yes I want a donut but I'm going to the drive through the lake it's allowed ok well this is different you can like pick up food you can like that was me picking up food it's honestly like it is keeping me sane so I got to drive I love driving I got to drive listen to some music I had the windows down it was amazing it was so fun anyways but as I was saying I'm very lucky to be able to come home to a big home with a lot of space and even like a home gym downstairs where I can go on a treadmill and kind of stay active stay sane I have plenty of food in the house you know my parents are loving and caring and yeah I'm very lucky wait guys Oh me guys notice okay it's fine also this is literally like I woke up I had my I went to class I had my online class and this is this is just how we're looking today actually wait I'm gonna show my outfit let's let some air in and I'm gonna show my outfit okay so this is my outfit yeah we've got a cute old brandy Melville cropped sweatshirt over a long t-shirt and some pajama pants that are actually my mom's because I quite literally only brought home like two pairs of leggings and three sweatshirts so I was planning to only be here for two weeks and then continued to hit the fan and I don't think I'll be going well actually my flight was just canceled so wouldn't be able to go back then anyway okay so I do something about this or no I don't think I care I've got a nice balcony so when it gets warm I can safely come out here and spend time outside and even if like a pool I could get in a pool I am very very lucky look I'm gonna be sitting on there doing my online classes just give it time so yeah I'm very hopeful that things are gonna be a lot better I mean things are fine now I'm just just frustrated with the situation as everyone is life is very strange right now also I'm a junior at NYU so like if I were a senior oh that would be insane oh and I came out here to mention that it's finally sunny and it's look at that the sun's gone it's fine actually it's kind of there like she's out a little bit oh my hair I can wash my face brush my teeth finally you know brush my teeth wash my face I have an interview at 1:00 it's not like a video it's like a phone so I don't have to look good I don't know if I'm gonna change or I don't know I'm probably gonna work out at some point today I have my mini version of stuff so we get the soy face cleanser moisturizer this is not many but I figured it's almost gone so I'm gonna use it up while I'm here let's see if I can show oh I've been watching people do that for years and I never understood how hard it was what's in store for today normally I think Maya quarantine routine would be like online class in the morning and then make breakfast which both of those I did and then I go downstairs and work out but I wanted to prepare for my interview cuz I'm really freaking nervous so I'm waiting I'm holding off on the working out there's water in my glasses I lose my train of thought very much and very much very often and I'm very scatterbrained especially right now with everything going on I feel like continuing to speak and even if it's just to a camera will help me in my interviews because the last interview that I had and this is for internships in the summer because that is something that I am interested in doing yeah but the last one I had was I was just so scatterbrained it was like the day after I flew home and I had just like found out that my entire life was going to be here for a while and I don't know I just felt very out of touch with the English language is that even oh my god I'm still it's just progressively getting worse but anyway we are blabbing right now naturally okay cool well should should I do this you know little transition action I've been watching vlogs for so long like it's insane YouTube has been like my main source of entertainment I don't really watch shows I don't really watch the movies very often like I was literally I'm obsessed with YouTube I have been since eighth grade freshman year of high school so like seven eight years this has been a long time coming honestly I should add in clips of other times where I've like decided I'm gonna become a blogger all right guys we're checking out this one I'm doing it I'm doing it okay cool  all right you need to do a great job blogging today it's not like I'm doing anything like super crazy exciting since it is quarantine season so have like an extremely long paper due on Monday so I need to get started on that getting kind of stressed but I decided I'm going to take today or I guess tonight to relax since I was really stressed about my interview this morning you know you just gotta reward yourself sometimes I think it went well so I'm gonna go downstairs oh wait how did you brush my teeth I technically already had a cookie after dinner so I shouldn't have another bowl OFI I'm honestly just gonna chill watch some videos go to bed early and then get up tomorrow and grind my go and get some Dunkin coffee I'm gonna drive through and we'll see but yeah I'll let you know if I do anything interesting and my professor literally just ended the class because he needed to go charge his computer do I you go back on do I not like I all right good morning I had some avocado toast had class I actually made my avocado toast during class but that is fine agenda is coming over I'm just gonna go for a walk in a park all right we're vlogging oh wait I haven't even shown the pretty flowers on the tree yet it's so springy I mean six six feet Idina said she really liked these purple flowers pretty positive they're weeds but that's okay yeah am I gonna keep doing - you little montage don't like how amazing and beautiful focus this good ol Missouri suburban walk to the park it man came back from a walk having some lunch that would actually just like greens with carrot cheese and some leftover pasta from the other night it's like GD noodles with some vodka sauce very good so I'm just going to you when I probably should start my paper again  I'm just working on my paper I honestly went after the last time I filmed I took a nap and then I woke up and watching watched youtube videos and then made a snack had some paleo puffs they're called it's by the brand like lesser lesser evil they're really good they taste like coconut oil honestly I also had some Jess mango from like the mango dehydrated mango slices from Trader Joe's but it was really sunny out for a bit honestly I'm glad it went away because I think I might be getting burnt I wanted I don't know I figured you know it's March it's not gonna happen but I think the UV index is actually kind of high I'm really pale so I'm gonna go inside so I can actually like really get to work on this I called my sister when I was out here honestly I really haven't started it on the paper came out here to do that called my sister and said you know I was inside before I'm planning on doing that and I ended up just falling asleep so so I just mentioned these earlier lesser evil paleo puffs they're literally so good I think through technically healthy you're not worried about that they honestly just taste like coconut oil yeah I mean were these I'm always shower for the night it's only 4:30 but I'm all showered for the night ready for dinner not gonna happen to know for a while but I need to start on this essay I'm gonna watch the movie finally and I'm gonna enough the block here in the first video I'm actually posting this I've already started editing it so much fun so yeah I'm just gonna watch this movie start on my paper it's really loud out here yes I'm gonna end up the vlog I'm excited to kind of come up with some more ideas on what I want to do for other videos yeah this has been fun so thank you guys for watching this Lighting's really good anyway yeah goodbye
