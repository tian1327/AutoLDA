 hey guys welcome back to my youtube channel I have been going through my Instagram and kind of changed my page around a little bit the aesthetic a little bit um so stay tuned to my Instagram which I will leave on the screen somewhere and I was going through some of my pictures and there are of course on Instagram there are pictures that are more liked than other pictures and I was like you know it would be really cool to kind of go through all of these pictures and look at that and I was like I wonder what makes some pictures more liked than others and I couldn't find any particular theme I thought it would be cool to go through my most liked Instagram pictures with you and kind of discuss what was going on in the moment why I took the picture what I was wearing what I was thinking what was going on in my life at the time so I felt like that would be cool so this first picture was when I was in Miami for Art Basel kind of trying to make it like a tradition to go to art basel every year my sister lives in Miami so it's easy I go down there to visit her anyways and we just kind of take partake in the fun festivities of Art Basel it was kind of like the start of Art Basel the kickoff to our Basel and this was like I don't know this was some rant up random day the festivities hadn't actually started but you know people were rolling into town to get ready for our bezel this was Art Basel 2019 so just last year and obviously you know I currently live in New York so I was in Florida taking advantage of the wonderful weather and my sister and I were kind of bored and she's like hey do you want to go run some scooters and just ride them around town cuz traffic is crazy around Art Basel so it's not fun taking an uber anywhere and we were like okay let's go so we just threw on some clothes I had no makeup on hence the hater blockers being on because it covers every single thing so I threw on jeans and a tee my t-shirt was a fitted cop from a shop in Soho called necessary clothing my jeans were from PacSun my sneakers were from Nike and I threw that on and we went out took some pictures cuz what are you gonna do it's our basil my sister and I were together were like yes let's take some pictures we gotta do it right we gotta get pictures from the gram so I was I gave her my camera I was walking away from her she was getting ready to like see what frame to fit me in and I had my sunglasses and I pulled and pulled them down and turned around and looked at her and she was already like shooting and then that's how I got that picture we took like a thousand other ones and that ended up being the best one so that one was fun I really enjoyed that day like I'll never forget that day so the next picture was also from Art Basel in Miami last year 2019 the background of this picture I really like because this is actually just a regular standard background this has nothing to do with Art Basel it's actually a very familiar residence for us and we were leaving this area it's a residential building and that's just their standard like this mural that they have like literally in the parking garage and we were like you know what let's get some pictures now cuz we're dressed up we look great we're dressed up and we don't know if we're gonna take pictures for the rest of the night or have the time or the space or the area and you know like girl it is sometimes so weird to stop and take pictures like everybody's staring at you why I don't know it's the most natural and normal thing that people do these days is take a bunch of pictures when they're out but like sometimes you feel weird doing it so they're like let's take some pictures of each other this particular picture I am wearing the same fitted cop top that I had in my previous photo and then I'm wearing a pair of paper bag I think they're called paper bag full other trousers from ASOS I'm wearing a pair of black heels that are also from ASOS that are not mine I brought those for my sister and then I have on a hat student I both have this hat and we were like let's just kind of be cool and quirky for Art Basel so that beret is actually an authentic military beret that I did buy online I can't remember where but it was from an authentic military store my sister and I both have them so we both had on matching berets that night and that was tons of fun I was walking my sister snapped the picture tip that's kind of like the best pictures to get in my opinion if trying to get your outfit it's really good to just instead of posing just walk like damn like several feet away from the camera and walk towards it and there you go that's a great picture because it kind of looks more natural she took that picture of me shoutouts kudos to my sister for that so this next picture was fall of 2019 I believe it was yeah the start of the fall like maybe September October of last year and it was the first kind of glimpse of like that fall weather coming in you're not gonna be drenched when you're walking around a New York City or standing underground at the subway like it's actually cool enough to throw on the sweater look kind of cold not need a coat but a sweater will do so that particular picture I snapped right before leaving my apartment so just go do some shopping and I was like I'm feeling myself I feel like I look good I'm gonna take a picture so I took a picture just standing in my mirror in my apartment in this particular picture I am wearing a gray Morel oversized sweater her sweatshirt from pretty little thing and I went up like one or two sizes because although it's oversized I wanted it to be huge on me so I purchased out like several sizes up I'm wearing my same PacSun jeans which I love and I'm wearing my Nike sneakers and I'm also wearing and the undershirt that I'm wearing is a white team that I borrowed aka stole from a guy that I was seeing at the time which is the perfect white tee to wear underneath any kind of like oversized look it kind of completes it because sometimes when you just have the sweater on in jeans it's like well I feel like something's missing this isn't a look you put that white tee you let it peek out a little bit underneath and it's oh look then and then all my draw in that picture is from and other stories in fact I remember that day I was heading out to go to and other stories to buy more jewelry because I'm like I need to like react my jewelry collection that's where I like the majority of my jewelry is from in other stories is from that picture this next picture is from a couple years ago 2018 fall I think it was like September of 20 tene my sister was in town for a wedding that we were both invited to it's a beautiful outdoor fall wedding but it was like more like end of the summer this was I think this was after the wedding or girl who was before and we were just taking pictures cuz what else are you gonna do a dress I'm wearing is from mango absolutely love that dress still wear it to this day I'm wearing a pair of black heels from ASOS and sunglasses I Gucci fun fact half way through the wedding my sister and I switch shoes so I think on I might have a picture on my Instagram account of me and a completely different pair of shoes and I took we took pictures like both ways and both pairs of shoes weird I know that's the kind of thing if that sisters do when they're together and there's a camera around so yeah that was tons of fun so this next picture is from last summer here of course here in New York it was a Friday was headed to go out for drinks with my friend here in New York summer Friday is the very very very best in New York weather was amazing I think this was in like June or July my through on a pair of jeans a tank top and this green Zara blazer that I still wear to this day I think I've had that blazer for almost three years now and I love it bright bright bright bright green I put on some makeup I think my jewelry was from and other stories as well I was feeling cute snapped a selfie right before I headed out and grabbed my purse my sunglasses and was out the door that was tons of fun so this next picture was taken I think either the summer of or the summer after I first moved to New York so this was an old post like I think I only posted it last summer but this picture is maybe two or three years old it was also summertime in New York headed out on a Saturday for dinner and drinks I think we also went to a park we met up and went to the park just before sunset and we were out in Brooklyn I believe in Greenpoint I went to a park while we were like waiting for dinner reservations like walking distance from the park to this restaurant yeah I remember that day I was wearing a white button-down from Zara I was like very been like tissue paper then but not see-through which I love so it was perfect to wear it what that with a pair of old old old old forever 21 jeans and I remember I had a fresh manicure that I had done myself you guys I'm through some makeup on pull my hair back in a ponytail and while we were waiting for our food we're like oh this is so beautiful because we were sitting outside and we had can't a candle at table and it was just so nice and we were like let's take some picture out in the summertime in New York City so yeah that was what that picture was fun okay and so this last picture was is actually a more recent picture this was just taken I think and like maybe early March end of February maybe of this year prior to the pandemic that has hit our nation and that has really really hit New York City and like the worst way possible but the sister was actually here in town visiting me and we went shopping we went to and other stores to re-up on jewelry and then I think like we went out to eat I just had it like a couple hours out in this picture you snapped this when I was leaving from having brunch together and I was like look at this beautiful wall like green wall and and like this is the start of like the spring in New York and there's these beautiful I know what you call it when like the whole wall is green and it's plants and it's really pretty in midtown Manhattan I was like can you take a picture of me watching past this sorry guys the Sun is setting so if this is this whitening is like that I'm still so so sorry so she snapped a
