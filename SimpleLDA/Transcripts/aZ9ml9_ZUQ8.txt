 guys this is the baggage terminal on a Friday there is no one here this is crazy what's up you guys I just got here to the airport I'm about to go check in this Airport is absolutely empty I mean just look around me there is seriously like no one here this is mad nut so my flight actually boards in about 30 minutes and from what I read on the emails that they're gonna be doing social distancing on the flight actually don't know how that's gonna look and so I'm gonna try to film it but essentially how I interpreted it is that if there's a middle seat that are going to be blocking that out so knowing is sitting right next to each other but with this particular aircraft you guys actually think it's a smaller aircraft where the seats are right next to each other meaning like just two seats per row so I don't know how that's going to work but maybe I'll just block out one in front of it and then keep one behind I know but we're about to find out so far you guys it's a total ghost town there's like literally no one in here this is crazy how empty it is  also we are now requiring face coverings while you are on board if you do not have a face covering for the flight please come see me at the podium for a mass thank you I just waited for them to call my number so far there's about a dozen people it looks like that are going to be boarding this flight I imagine there's gonna be more but that's about all I could see    I guess just boarding the flight right now to Las Vegas see you in Vegas baby   alright guys I just landed in Las Vegas and as you can tell there's pretty much no one here either it is basically empty everywhere you look which is just so weird because usually this Airport is packed with people so as you guys can see this Airport is pretty much empty almost no one and as you can see here that actually closed off the gambling section so you can't even do it if you wanted to I'm actually gonna be taking this off just because it's a little easier to talk to you guys with it off plus I mean there's no one around me anyway but I have a few minutes to kill before I have to check into my hotel so I figured I would actually tell you guys the experience that I had while traveling so first and foremost traveling with the mass honesty was even that big a deal I didn't mind it at all I did see a few people without their masks and they actually wouldn't allow those people to board the plane and unless they had a mask on and so a lot of people would either buy them or a lot of airlines would actually provide a mask for you which I thought was pretty cool over at San Francisco they provided a mask to everyone that didn't have one all the stewardess and pilots had masks which is really cool and then as far as boarding the aircraft you guys they actually board it from the back first so usually how it works there's like priority boarding and like first-class boards and then it works its way to the rear well with the pandemic going on what they do is that they board the rear first then work their way up to the front which I actually think is smarter and my personal opinion another thing I was really curious about when flying is how packed the flight was gonna be so as you guys saw the play was about 15 maybe 70% full so I actually heard them speak over the intercom and saying that the max percent they do was 70 percent and so I think my flight was maybe around there that was really interesting to see that they actually don't pack the flight another thing that they do to prevent spreading any type of coronavirus germs they actually don't provide any type of drinks or snacks or anything like that in fact there is very limited to service at all usually what they did on both legs of my flight is that they just walk up and down the aisle with a trash bag so people can throw stuff away that maybe they purchased earlier beforehand but other than that you guys like the service is pretty darn minimal also another good thing that I want to mention here in Vegas there's actually music playing but in a Salt Lake City Airport as well as the San Francisco Airport it was so eerie so first off there's not very many people there's no music playing you know you're in a place that's usually packed with travelers but there's just none and so it was just kinda like this year you feeling almost kinda like a bit and it were the world type thing but anyways that was just one thing that I thought was just kind of eerie but at the same time a little bit historic because this will more than likely never happen again in my lifetime and so the build of witness and experienced this firsthand was kind of a historical feeling so I got a hotel just outside the strip far as I'm concerned the strip is still closed down at least the hotels are I could probably so I can go check-in and whatnot   Volquez about to go get my bag just got off the tram there was like no one in it and again there is no one here this Airport cannot be more empty guys it's crazy just the whole feeling and the experience so far has been a little eerie like ice mentioned but also kind of a historical cool feeling it I guess you could say in a way in order to get to the hotel I got it uber and so this whole trip you guys it's gonna be just a bunch of first for me as far as traveling go just because I flew on a plane for the first time during the pandemic I'm gonna be staying in a hotel for the first time during at the pandemic and I'm gonna be doing a mover ride for the first time during the pandemics I will say this it is so hot here in Vegas especially here inside the airport I don't know how it's this hot when we landed the pilot said that it was over a hundred degrees today and we actually flew over Lake Mead and I looked down at the lake and I was like oh my gosh I was literally there last weekend in the water and it just looks so refreshing heck I'd love to go back there he'll lose amazing if you guys haven't seen that video we'd definitely go check it out because we had so much fun and just makes me want to go back so bad I just want to point out it is a Friday yes a Friday and I am the only one it feels like this an entire Airport so crazy guys the baggage terminal on a Friday there is no one here this is crazy look at this no one oh my gosh this is just nuts right now    usually the pickup location where who would be would be packed and there is really not a whole lot of people here look at that is crazy well guys I was able to check into my hotel early which I am beyond thrilled about because I am definitely outside the window but I am guessing that I am able to check in early only because there's no one here come on let's be real    I'm not gonna lie this is a pretty nice little setup it'll say this though after checking out the entire hotel room I was thinking wow this is pretty clean place then I realize this little number yes that is someone's shorts from whoever stayed here last so you know for a fact I'm not touching that thing but oh my gosh like I thought for sure they would have cleaned it on the one positive side note it does look like it's a brand new pair of shorts because it still has the tag on it but still like oh I'm not touching that I'm pretty starving though yes luckily my view is pretty amazing because I look out on to Cracker Barrel that Cracker Barrel looks absolutely amazing so I'm gonna go ahead on over there and get some lunch do some work stuff and then I'll check back in with you guys  okay lunch was delicious I think I called Cracker Barrel Crate and Barrel a few times balls in there which was kind of funny honestly I have never been there before and I thought the food was so freakin good plus it was like a freakin steel it was like eight bucks or something like that anyway I love those kind of places I thought it tasted delicious but I am just finishing up some work stuff as you can see I got my little command station set up over here honestly I'm just gonna sign off right now because I am exhausted and I need some serious sleep for tomorrow because tomorrow is gonna be a big day for me and things kick off tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. which means I got to be there earlier and there's just go go go all the way until 9:00 p.m. when I land back in Utah so I'm gonna sign off because I'm exhausted and I need some sleep and I still got work to do and I still got the vlog to do but if you guys are new to the channel welcome I hope you guys enjoyed today's vlog and were able to have a first-hand experience with
