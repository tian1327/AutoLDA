  chewing on broken glass bathing and spiders licking on razor blades dancing taking my dog on a walk trying to a new recommendation from the CDC is to wear a cloth mask during the coronavirus stuff decided I'd start vlogging again I have nothing else to do taking a week off of work I'm very lucky to still have work and to be able to work from home I guess I'm lucky during this outbreak I don't really know what I'm going to talk about I just figured I'd start vlogging again just gonna run around and say my ideas our presidents an idiot it's kind of the result of when you doubt people who are experts who know what they're talking about and you'd rather see your numbers and your popularity and money over actual experts actual actually saving lives so I think a lot of this mess is because of his inaccuracy it's from the top down the rest is just can't be helped it's a freaking pandemic just gonna take your country freakin down to its knees trying to figure out how to stop being depressed by this and to start being creative again so next week I have off of work taking some vacation time because I just need a mental break and hopefully I'll just start vlogging again making videos just shooting this on my camera I don't really know what to talk about or what to do but I figure I just start shooting and see what happens so this video might be super boring I apologize keep walking my dog all the best fingernails and pliers needles in my eyes strangled with wire I have to say that this dog right down here hates going on walks hates it really does hey Tim do you hate going on walks do you really hate it I bet you did you do little Tim hates walks yeah you do you just want to go home sorry bud you're getting hyper as you need to go out for a walk I think I need to take this time that we have to stay at home and not go out to actually start being more creative keep saying that's myself I just been in such a creative slump for so long like I've been in part of a couple of bluegrass bands but she felt like we were just doing cover songs I was doing somebody else's music and I was not being creative at all so maybe this you know how shitty this is this pandemic it's a good time to maybe to start doing some self-reflection and come out with a new direction with I want to do my creativity maybe what I want to do with my career and myself something I just need to pick up guitar or do something creative on a daily basis even if it's only ten minutes a day and I'd like to record that and share that with people and hopefully start doing this vlogging stuff more I think I was having a lot of fun when I was doing vlogs on a regular basis least learning how to do something creative with video so I think I might start that up again maybe not every day like the daily vlogging thing but 2 to 3 times a week I think that would be fun maybe depends on how much work it is man vlogging is a lot of work editing video down takes some time and here's the new reality we're in we have to stay 6 feet away from each other so there's a gentleman walking on the sidewalk so I had to move out of the way so we can safely pass each other least I'm doing that a lot of people aren't keeping that social distancing  they're just not doing it yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do my gonna just pick up the guitar every night I started playing with Adobe animate and I was able to start doing some like really cheesy animation should my creativity project be starting a new business always wanted to start a new business I've tried a couple times and I've fallen flat and it just takes so much time and energy and effort I don't know if this has happens to you but whatever I get home at night after doing all my work and I run to work out it's like 9:10 p.m. I no longer want to do anything creative I want to sit my ass down you know play video game watch TV you just go to sleep so somehow I need to like resist all that and do the creative thing do the projects I want part of me let's do everything I want to write music I want to start a new business I want to create a website I want to do animation but man that shit's impossible and I feel so all over the place that I don't even want to choose one I want to do them all I don't know if can do them all probably just not possible and I don't know what to choose right now going insane insane screams this little piggy goes riding drop max maniac goes cha cha me cha cha cha me cha I need a haircut that's some silly growing right there Oh Tim your walk is almost over are you happy you can tell you're almost home all right whatever you do don't perform for the camera just look away from the camera like it's not even there you got this perfect okay the dog walk is over yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do I really don't know we're new but I gotta do something so don't go insane and I do have to count myself very lucky I got a job and I got a beautiful girlfriend that I have had the stay-at-home order with so I'm very lucky for that and also I've got a cute little dog so the world it could be worse it could be worse but yeah I'll keep you updated about what I'm doing hopefully I do these cheesy vlogs I might just do live streams so it's not much editing because sometimes life is freaking busy I don't have hours to edit video so yeah I'll try to do something I'll try can't guarantee anything I'll try get my creative juices back into gear and that's it hope you all have a good day and are staying home and staying safe and uh I got races and they're broken in the dentist office is closed oh no nothing I can do it up about it my teeth are gonna get even worse thank you pandemic thank you flames are licking at souls in torment demons cackling torture Zaman and snapping back bones hearts
