and having that stuff be like simple it's not true it ain't true people it ain't true my work phone has been blowing up since 7:00 something in the morning and I don't start at that time so I was dealing with that kind of stuff and then I just took like two pills for a headache and I took a little pause on that and I'm gonna eat some breakfast right now and then I'm gonna continue with that and then like I guess wash my face because I don't think I'm changing out of this flow state so I was getting a healthier breakfast like appeal but honestly I can't be bothered so you know what red

bunch of calls and do that crap but let's see how this goes let's see how this goes today how are you guys doing what's up I watched the Valhalla murders on Netflix last night and I just wanted to say

it's also been out finish watching it tonight so go check that out go check it out I'll give you some other Netflix or Hulu suggestions or or Amazon Prime suggestions as we go because you guys are gonna most of you're gonna be stuck at home so you know maybe you'll have some suggestions and something to watch um so yeah alright I'll check in with you guys later I'm gonna eat this and I'm gonna try to get it together alright  hey guys so I wanted to show you something really quick before I ate it oh well it's scary I'm so sleepy and I've been on the computer for like hours but I was just gonna eat something right now and I wanted to show you what I'm having which is I don't know if you can see it too well it's just chicken and some lettuce and some salad dressing and this which I wanted to show you guys so this is farmhouse culture crunchy sauerkraut for anybody and I'm ringing from the fridge for anybody with digestive issues or whatnot please get yourself some sauerkraut some fermented cabbage it's really helped apart from all the supplements that I do take but I just put that little meal together I had boiled some chicken the other day that I had and I'm just having two tortillas like the low carb whatever TTS I think I've shown them before on my channel and I'm having that with just the lettuce and the fermented cabbage and probably after I eat that I'm going to want to go to see cuz I'm really sleepy all right well I'll hit you up I hate you guys hope later but so worried nothing exciting has happened and Quarantine time yeah it's not coronal I hope not okay so we're back um so since I left you guys it's uh 6:30 right now I actually finished working about an hour an hour ago pretty much an hour ago and the plan right now was I'm gonna have a chat with you guys about a few things that have been bothering me and I'm gonna vet on YouTube and then I was gonna try try to do a home workout if it goes cool then tomorrow's video then I can show you what I do but like will see cuz like I don't know I ate that food that I showed earlier and I just been working and you know we're here so you know I wanted to talk about people who confuse work and personal life and the reason why I'm saying this is because in times like these when Shi T is getting real you know and things are chaotic and everyone's up their own butthole okay cuz I'm trying not to curse on this channel cuz I curse a lot but I do not want to get D monetized so I'm trying um it's like you really notice how some people are so unbelievably self-centered okay we see it with the whole toilet paper stuff like no bra you don't need a bunch of toilet paper no you don't need to buy all the food like hello and so I just wanted to you know talk about like how do you guys feel about work and distancing yourself from people at work and I've noticed not even now but in the past that some people want to be your friend at the office so they can get perks from you later or they want to be personally friendly with you out of work so you can give them a service like a better service because your homies and honestly that's not cool I've had a lot of people that are that I've made friendships without work and they respect that like this is work and this is personal and that's it but a lot of people just don't do that and I just don't understand where the consciousness of that is so in my opinion and this is kind of like one of my chit chats which I used to do unfortunately unfortunately because sometimes you meet really great people at work that you relate to and you can have friendships with and if you can that's great and I have friendships with people that I used to work with that I still have today which is awesome but it's very very very limited and um but for the most part I just feel like unfortunately you just can't be friends with people at work you just can't you just can't if you don't work out that job and you leave and you wanted them to behave it ok fine but it's not like you just can't you can't do it because not a lot of people know boundaries they don't get boundaries they don't understand boundaries I mean even people that are close to you family ones or not sometimes don't even understand boundaries so much less somebody like at your job is gonna get boundaries so I wanted to touch on that another thing that I wanted to touch on today is like you know it's so um and if I look down this cuz I'm thinking sometimes it's so frustrating and saddening that we artists and some people are saying it's not a big deal some people are saying it's a big deal and all this stuff but the big deal here in my opinion besides you know Kovan 19 and whatnot is the fact that a lot of people are gonna lose their jobs a lot of people are gonna lose their jobs a lot of people in the service industry let's put it that way how are they gonna make a living how are they gonna make any money they're gonna I mean unless they have parents that they can move into those homes and those places like what are they gonna do and it's just so infuriating to me that a lot of them are gonna get laid off they're gonna get probably unemployment for six months maybe less you don't know and that's it and they're going to struggle and it's just like so infuriating to me that at least for me personally I don't know who else is watching but at least in the u.s. we're supposed to be this rich and prosperous country and yet that's where we leave our citizens like I don't like to get political and I'm not trying to get political because I don't want anybody to get their panties in a bunch but this is just off that for a second it's just like there's so many people they're not gonna have jobs right now there's so many people are not gonna be able to pay the rent there's so many people that are gonna go like in undeniable debt there's so many people that are probably so stressed right now they can't even sleep and it's like it would be it would be nice if the government would just come out and be like hey citizens of the united states um don't worry about it we're gonna give you this stipend for a year depending based on your salary not just like EDD for six months a tedious unemployment for three months or six months or whatever but just off the bat you're gonna get this you're not gonna have to worry or at least companies probably even the private sector that's the stuff so much money would tell their workers you know what we are going to lay you off in a way you're gonna still be employed with us but we're gonna pay you let's say half to three-quarters of your salary and we're gonna do it for this is Louie okay and we're gonna do it for a period of time and that people could rest easy and they could be stress-free and they wouldn't be so like right now having like massive anxiety so just food for thought it just been going on even especially at my place and whatnot there's talks about layoffs and this and that whatever and um all that stuff I mean I I'm not where it's not that I'm not worried it's just like I personally have set myself up in a position where like I know that I'll be okay you know things will be a have to be methodically thought about and put together but I'll be fine but you think of other people and you just like wonder like you know what are what are 30 percent because now it's looking like 30 percent what a 30 percent of Americans gonna do and that number is gonna rise and not until probably 2021 are people gonna actually be able to recover from this so those are some thoughts again not trying to get political here whatsoever not trying to get anybody's panties in a bunch the fact and the bottom line the facts in the bottom line here is the fact that you know you lose jobs you don't get paid you stress yourself out life gets hard that's just the basis of what we're talking about right now and it really sucks when it's nobody's fault that the corona virus is out there and it's spreading do you know what I'm saying so just you know just that apart from stay away from people at work or you know create boundaries in your life create boundaries otherwise most people will just trample all over you so thank you for tuning in to this segment yeah and I'm gonna try that homework out I'm gonna see how that goes I'm probably gonna wrap up this video right now even though it's that sick something so I can edit it really quick and have it up for you guys by the end of the night and and I'll probably see you tomorrow I'm gonna try to make sure that I make these every single day because I'm not going anywhere I mean that's a little complicated because I might have to go out of the house which is something else that we'll discuss later on but um but yeah for the most part I'm gonna try to make it make them everyday you know while this stuff is going on so I hope all of you are staying safe and taking the precautions that you need to and hopefully you can find toilet paper that's a joke but you know you know what I mean I'll and you know so um I will see you tomorrow and thank you so much for tuning in and until next time bye you
