 we smash through the highways throw a shadow to sunrays yeah so this is mine and we have some sauteed chicken with some spring rolls Roselli underneath this is like my favorite my go-to dish the cilantro and then this is his gigantic bowl of  oh my god I want some bees all those guys there's no toilet paper like I all there seems to be filled with toilet paper plain I can't even I actually need toilet paper right now and yeah this is so ridiculous there's still no lights always this is like don't care cuz I need to clean my makeup room you guys what the hell okay so anyways my gym is closed right now because of the whole Cove in nineteen in situation all the gyms are closed so I'm basically stuck eating pizza getting fat and we're going to see through the city to try to find the zone some good food I guess yeah so that's what we're doing today this is my four night shift tonight of six so the end is near I can feel it we're headed to get some coffee think are the Torrance's are so open so far drive through drive-thrus are open the actual stores are closed and yeah a lot of the places are closed now we had issues writing 12 paper last week and if you guys saw in the previous clip basically we drove throughout the whole entire city I started calling different places nobody had 12 paper and shoppers did but it was like $14 for first six rolls or something ridiculous like that so PSA please stop hoarding all the toilet paper please stop hoarding the toilet paper okay some of us actually are not workers and some of us actually need it so it's really annoying when you go to the store and there's no toilet paper  so we decided to take our food home and this is what I got I got the chicken in us all so yeah oh my god it's amazing it's like barbecued chicken he opened that smells amazing  Oh like I'm trying to be John Frieda I like crush for the first time because my regular purple shampoo was actually manufactured Italy so they don't have me in stock anywhere so yeah I'm just little leave out of my hair for a bit you wanna say hi to the vlog poo what are you doing so we just watched like the weirdest movie ever was it was a call Tara fire it was about a creepy clown that killed everyone and literally everyone in the movie died and then the clown killed himself but he was still alive at the end so if you guys want to watch a big creepy clown movie I didn't think it was very good I liked it way better but you guys can check that when I want to hear into clowns or if you're like him and you're not so into clowns so yeah I'm gonna leave this in my hair for a bit and then wash it out and hopefully my hair is I'm going for like a grayish silver boat let's see what happens I've never used like a drugstore purple shampoo before but this was literally like my only option because most places are closed right now so I had to get this at Walmart so let's hope it works  hey everyone I don't even know if I did an intro for this ball yet but basically today I'm gonna be just heading out to get a smoothie I'm gonna actually order one online or like I think I have to call them and then just pick it up because I really want to smoothie right now and that's what I'm gonna do I'm probably gonna try to walk my dog or something just because I don't want to be in the house all day long again I'm also gonna try to go to Walmart and buy some weight there's just another thing that I'm missing for my workouts is weeks so I'm gonna try to do that right now I'm really hoping it just looks cold outside like it looks cold I know some of the snow is melted and it's probably gonna be really like my feet are probably gonna be soaked and so are my pads but you know what it's fine it's fine we can deal so that's what I'm gonna be doing today I really miss going out okay who's you guys oh my god I really just I miss my PA code okay you guys I really do okay you guys I'm at Walmart trying to find weights and look they have none I seriously I'm having the worst look at finding anything and it's really annoying empty shelves galore hello so we're at Walmart I try to find weights but they don't have any but you guys guess what I found what I finally found I found Lysol wipes these are the like store brand but whatever I am so happy you have no idea now I can actually go home and clean and maybe like a foam a clean with me video we'll see what happens so yesterday's boring I was gonna go out for a run but literally I have an hour before sunset and it's freezing out here so actually five degrees I don't know I'm just cold no no no I haven't been to work in like two days No so I'm probably gonna do an at-home workout later watch some the 90-day fiance you lean a little bit and then I don't know I don't know what we're gonna have for dinner yet how's your David going to don't worry thank you very nice  okay so this is the before    okay guys so this is the after it's all clean yay there's no more dust well there's a little bit of dust the dust that's on there right now because I wiped it with a Windex wipe and there's just a little bit of dust so I'm gonna fix that but for the most part it's all reorganized this won't last very long but it looks nice right now yeh so it's a little bit crowded over here on the side but that's fine    hold me close till I get up time is barely outside I don't want always would
