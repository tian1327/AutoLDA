are empty  but people are saying although expressways are and these streets are empty which is good I have a little furry baby right here so you guys already know so I do have to take her all on her walks I usually take her three times but with this whole thing going on and just take her twice once I really feel like she you know she tells me she needs to go then and of course I will take her but

I've been working on finish that up it's pretty much finished I just need to add hello you just need to add music to it but it I've been staying informed as to what this point on and still I mean it is very scary of what is happening out there this seems like that's everything more on just talking about is now almost 373 I have been editing my video my latest video which is kind of old I would say it's actually when I went to the air and water show back in 2019 I just made that public air water show in Chicago here so go and watch that if you comin plenty to catch up with some old videos that I did record in the past for example like I want to really know with my sister's I'm pretending to chance to edit that as well as a for the rest of the day I'm probably gonna get the video started like you know get all the clips together but I think I'm gonna start cleaning of room and I think we are in quarantine I am getting hungry yesterday I made if I heat this so I made chicken with burrs I made like red pepper yellow pepper onion tomatoes and jalapenos I made some beans I made black beans they did them exactly the same way I do the pinto beans and if you haven't watched a video called watch it yeah I'm gonna keep myself busy my baby over there is taking a nap I'm working on my video much for the last few hours and but I've also been taking like a lot of breaks so I've been taking you know social media breaks I've been texting with people of and on the phone I called my mom like little things like that I'm gonna start cleaning one of the bedroom I know it's time to get some stuff and so I think this is the perfect time for fluttering cleaning kind of just stuff probably gonna get a snack little bit eat a little something-something because I'm gonna go hungry hungry um trying to stay hydrated guys well it's been raining pretty much all day yeah I mean this is what I'm doing hey we're drinking kombucha if you haven't tried it I highly highly recommend kombucha it's so good I was I got a little curious on kombucha because I have the following this girl called the florist I will post your channel down below if you don't follow her or if you don't know longer I would say go ahead and watch her videos I always watched her like drink air kombucha and was like I'm kind of like if he crazy about the idea of kombucha would she and she explained kind of like what it was I'm like okay I'm a little curious but I'm not like curious enough to go and buy it then I started working for this company that had kombucha on tap was amazing and I tried it so good it was so good and then I stopped working for their company in front to only one day so I decided to get it they had different brands so I tried this one this one is the pink lady Apple is really really good and there was another one and I can't think of the name right now but I'm gonna go get it okay so the one that I originally tried out is called synergy and it looks like this my favorite favorite is try ologies I'm not sure if I'm saying it correctly but it basically looked like for punch I tried it and I fell in love with it so ever since then I thought an Aldi bought a few bottles  kombucha also the other friend they originally showed was really good as well highly suggested it's basically like flavored it's like a flavor how could I describe it the flavored clumps so now but it has probiotics and it's Apple speak good for you close to help with let me see okay but I did look into it and it does have a lot of health benefit I think like a stomach the digestion and take help overall it's supposed to be healthy for you start cleaning up a little bit I hope everyone's staying safe everyone's staying inside even touch with your loved ones cuz I know they you know you know upon people making sure that they're okay that may not need anything every time I go to the store which it lately it kind of has been like once a day a little like Aldi I see that there are that they are stocked with like no like the essentials like milk bread eggs I've seen a lot of people online looking for diapers so if I see any of that stuff like I've been doing a picture and then posting it on like my Facebook just on that are looking for those items to go to the store and have them available to them but I feel like I wish I could do more but I guess that for now like you know I guess that's a good way to help right many people know what the stores have it did stock up on food you have like I was constantly going all day because I'm in search of like milk of was insufficient 12 eggs and 30s like those two items were nowhere to be found I did go to the store a few times since Friday and I couldn't get them but finally got my hands on some eggs and some 30-odd is a little bit of - not that I wanted more but like for the eggs like I'm good with limit - but for the 30s like we do eat a lot of Sophia's here whether it's like with eggs or with like a meat dish or something but we didn't get bread as well so we would be able to eat like a sandwich I do like avocado toast so other kind of tools to be like what are the things that I would right now especially because avocado you do have to eat it kind of like insistently so it won't go bad and right now you know it is a bad time for anyone to kind of throw away food or just have food go to waste you know a lot of people in the of gonna eat or just in general it doesn't you know just because the coronavirus is going on does it mean that we throw away food you know just in general people go hungry every single day and they go to sleep some great kids kids sometimes don't have anything to eat and they go to sleep hungry so you know it's never a good time to just let food go to waste more consider it everything going on as much as you can mister cleaning a great a snack you
