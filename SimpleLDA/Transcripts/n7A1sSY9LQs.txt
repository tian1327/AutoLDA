 hey guys welcome back to my channel or welcome to my channel if you're new here today we are headed to the outlets the outlets just opened and i have been dying to go to michael kors and kate spade and all my favorite stores so that is the plan for today and bentley's so happy to go shopping right benny i went shopping  hi i can't even see me am i not there i can see you okay so we made it to the outlets and it is crazy here there's lines everywhere to get in people were like waiting in line to get into stores this is a line for what justice justice for justice so we are in banana republican and they have everything 60 off all their clearance so i'm gonna try to get some good deals in here because i like better than your friends together on a rent on tuesday night when your world is upside down it'll always set you right so pour it out drink it up in a waterford or dixie cup columbia also has like 70 off of everything that seems to be like the deal of the day 70 and 60. but we're getting bentley a new winter coat let me see it show me oh i love so we just got done shopping at the outlets did you have fun now we're gonna go get my food because i'm spoiled and we just got pizza and then we're gonna go shopping more no no all right we are headed into hobby lobby and it's windy and cold and i'm freezing okay we're getting it now now i'm freezing so we're gonna see what that way we're gonna go see what kind of deals they have right now they have a lot of good stuff on clearance too like this is 2.99 little cactuses for 249. not sure where you put these but they're really cute they're only 249 the bigger ones are 349. they have 80 off of all their easter stuff you guys plan on decorating for the 4th of july hobby lobby has some cute stuff all right guys we are now at burlington they have a sign up that everything is 50 off but there's a line to get in so all the shoes are like 50 off so these would be like 12.50 these guest shoes would be 12.50 these adidas would be 17. 17.50 these converses are cute are they the same price maybe 15. 15. geez a lot of the stuff though is kind of picked over i figured i would show you guys really quickly what i got from when we went shopping yesterday so i'm going to start with um michael kors first i already took everything out of this bag because i can't wait to like open things and like switch things out so i got a new michael kors purse this is the one i got it's actually like a really nice gray any kind of purse that i get has to have a strap because i just don't like carrying purses like this i like the strap and then i got this which i also already switched out but it is just this really nice michael kors wallet this was like on their clearance i think this was like literally less than 40 bucks or it might have been 40. but the reason i bought this i don't know if it's just me but the inside is red and it reminds me of louis vuitton's so then this purse was like 120 after tax and stuff so i really like that michael kors was having like 70 off of everything plus in their clearance was an additional 75 off then i went to columbia and i really only went there for one reason and it was to get belly a new winter coat for next year and hopefully the year after that so i ended up getting him this one it's like a green and gray color this was originally like 80. 80 and i got it for less than 40 i believe or it might have been 40. this was 60 percent off so i like it because it has the insulated inside and this will keep him nice and warm and i got it in a small it is kind of big on him now but i figured by the winter it will fit a little bit better so then i went to banana republic i don't shop there a lot just because it is pricey but i ended up getting two things and they were less than twenty dollars so i got this like really nice shirt i like this i think this will look really nice tucked into my high waisted shorts that's like my reasoning behind it and it says live passionately and i just like the silver on there and the font this is more of a wintry item but you can never have enough sweaters and i thought this would be cute for valentine's day so i got this both of my shirts are in size extra small hobby lobby and i was there for like two hours looking at everything they had so many good deals so i got all this stuff on clearance my total was eight dollars and 22 cents so i ended up getting these little underwater stickers i figured bentley and i can do like an underwater activity this week these were 89 i ended up getting this glitter glue to make the water it's like a really pretty aqua color and this was a dollop 24. i got these little foam stickers here these are for like a winter craft but these were also 89 so i couldn't pass them up this is probably my favorite one this one you can make little toilet paper roll people and you just need obviously toilet paper rolls which everyone has but they can make all different kind of things like that and this was only 74 cents i ended up getting this little easter bunny thing to put in bentley's room next year for easter i like decorating his room for like every holiday so the last thing i got is for my keys which i seen this i grabbed it and then i was like no i don't need it and i put it back and then i went back and grabbed it and i was like yes i need that it is just a letter j for my keys and it is like really cute leopard print which i'm into so that is all that i got from the outlets and hobby lobby but just because i didn't get a lot of footage from yesterday i'm gonna make this like a weekend vlog so i'm gonna come behind yesterday which was saturday and today which is sunday into one video so i hope you guys like this and let's get on with our sunday i'm not gonna stop don't care if i'm sure i should so for breakfast bentley's just gonna have two hard-boiled eggs and then four strawberries cut up hi babe so i wanted to share with you guys in case you have toddlers or younger kids this is on netflix it's called the leap frog letter factory but this is so awesome because it helps them learn every letter obviously a through z it's only about 35 minutes long but we will like sit there and watch the whole thing start to finish no issues i told you guys in a previous vlog that the schools preschools um daycares things like that were opening back up in my state and they opened they ended up opening about two weeks ago bentley is still here obviously i decided that i just wanted to keep him home two more weeks i don't want to change my upload days or um have to hide anything i am allowing him to go back to school the first week of june i'm going to give it a go if it doesn't work out if i don't feel safe or comfortable obviously he's not gonna go anymore the only reason i feel like i need to tell you guys is because when i film i usually do film on wednesdays i don't want to have to change my following day or my uploading day to accommodate to hide the fact that i am letting bentley go back to school i just want to be open and honest with you guys um i do not want to hide things i am not one to lie about things so i will always be open and honest with you guys if you don't agree with my decision um just keep your thoughts to yourself please i'm doing i promise what i feel is best for bentley and what i feel is safe and not safe obviously i didn't think it was safe to send him two weeks ago so he didn't go he's been home with me and it's been great but there's talk that my work is going to be opening back up and if my work opens back up he needs to be going to school so that i can go to work so i don't want to you know not send him and then not be able to work so i need to do what is best not only for him but for me as well so this is what i think is best and i just want to let you guys know my decision of course i will let you guys know my thoughts my opinions on how it goes and stuff but i just want to be open and honest with you guys because when i watch youtubers i expect that and i would never want to give less than i expect bentley and i are in the car i have to go to the store and i have to pick up crickets for my gekko which is like a weekly thing i need to go to the store and pick up a fruit and veggie tray i'm headed to my best friend's house tomorrow i am her maid of honor in her wedding and so we are working on some wedding planning things and then what else do we need to do i want to see if i can get some new like light shades for bentley's room for his fan i hate the ones that are in there like they need to go we are still working on the whole like remodeling process it is taking a little bit longer than like i was expecting but there's just like a lot that needs done in that room and taking off the border and everything and cleaning all the walls is taking a little bit longer than i was hoping it was going to but it's fine his room will be done eventually look at the turtle so you guys know i've been coming to target somewhat regularly not a lot but i'm at target today with bentley and the store is jam-packed like i've never seen it so busy since quarantine just got done at the grocery store and running to target i had to just get like i said a few things from the grocery store i feel like i go to the grocery store like three or four times a week and right after i go i'm like crap i need something else so i think i need to get better at that because i'm tired of going to the grocery store like three times a week ended up getting like the fruit and veggie tray for tomorrow and then what else did i get i got some eggs some ground meats bentley's little peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and strawberries for him but i think we are gonna head to dunkin donuts
