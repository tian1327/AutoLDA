 I'm walking downtown today and this is Monday what is this the March 9th and things are pretty quiet the streets are really quiet but overall I think things are somewhat ok but we'll see how  Seattle it's definitely quieter streets are quite dead it's a little eerie but construction still going on Rainier now it's the rainier building a former amazon building i think it's being sublattice I'm gonna head to the gym for a little bit workout but very super giri we used to be super busy down here and the streets walking by myself it is uh probably crazy I got a lot of footage of these streets that used to be just full of traffic and it's dead it's like a Christmas day our holiday right now all right I'm gonna head to the gym I had a nice workout it is incredibly dead in there yeah watching Athletic Club is members are tend to be a little bit older so having it lower attends is unusual and I'm walking to my therapy session yes I participate in therapy because mental health is important that Street car had one persona in a driver very scary but now I'm heading to write for lunch and then go to my little session way back big burger right it's important in use for businesses you can be happen economy's hurting it's important to do a restless heart I need our support so I'm here for local businesses in Seattle earth definitely hashtags moment   the Amazon campus is completely dead because both Microsoft and Amazon are asking their place to work at home so this area used to be very bustling and it's now pretty much completely dead Raymond head down the light-rail to go pick up my car there's only like six thousand dollars worth of deferred maintenance that I'm gonna continue to defer because just futures uncertain and so it makes sense to just pull it off and now hopefully drive the car into the ground and figure it out later all right we'll see you soon  in Chinatown racial discrimination mocking at downtown in the International District Seattle's a desert town and I think this virus was causing you cannot make huge economic issues because I think local businesses are feeling it and it's gonna be a late effect because it's all these revenues are not gonna come in and it's gonna have a trickle-down effect all across the economy no idea how this is gonna turn out definitely feeling it for a from my business perspective a couple of canceled contracts but we just have to deal with it riding a ferry to Vashon just dropped out the car got the car and I'm paying by car ferry the best Washington State ferry yeah I'm gonna head home and hang out spend the night it's a couple nights here in rash on then it's kind of cool that spending life between two locations did a little PowerPoint deck cleanup today I think I liked it tap in that market a little bit more because I do quite a bit of it and it's a not that hard and has a lot of value and trying to figure out how to do it at scale but I'm gonna try to put together an offering this week on that I'm also working on a visual resume using mural I got a lot of hits on that hand-drawn one now I'd like to do a virtual whiteboard version so that's the plant yeah beautiful day so it's nice to sit out in the Sun for a little bit it's a 737 driving back to see out of today spend a couple of nights in Seattle and catch up on work and things there things are relatively really slow now because the coronavirus and so that kind of said damper on the business but I'm gonna have to start work doing some contingency planning I do have a couple gigs coming up in April so that does cover things but if those fall through then I'm in trouble so I'm gonna get a couple more things in the pipeline to balance everything out so today and tomorrow and it's gonna be a networking day virtually all the way home I stopped at a park I'm just gonna take a break from trying to grind it out I think sometimes you got to just pause and in fines with space to relax and reflect and regroup yourself this whole virus just happening especially in the Seattle being kind of the focus of the nation right now it's really put a damper on a lot of business I think everyone is trying to figure things out every conference every event has been canceled and when my business is so focused on being in person it's definitely putting a damper on things it caused me to rethink some of my strategies I think maybe going to a digital first business is is the right move but also while I'm doing this I think I've gotten a lot of demands on just facilitating virtual meetings people are trying to figure out how to do this virtual thing kind of Brunton zoom meetings how to create a video so if you create content and distribute to people without physically being in gathering large groups that's always been there so I think it's just maybe leaning a little bit more in Tunis I'm fairly certain I'm not rushing into it because I think that the man is high it's always been there it's always been high people haven't solved it but this is now I guess the catalyst that's gonna cause a lot of companies to really hunker down and figure out how to solve remote work remote collaboration so I'm going to double down on mural as my virtual whiteboard when using zoom I love it so much more than Skype or our teams it's just easier fun interfaces I like that one I'm gonna use it a little bit more you know think since everyone there's so much on lockdown because of the buyer so far one of the good important things to do is get out it's on walking a little bit more I've been exercising a lot more than it had before and overall that's good working on mental health and I think just the world is changing this is A virus / bacterial 9/11 equivalent so I remember in 9/11 I mean the world was changed and I resisted how it's going to impact travel and the airports but it's the reality it's gonna change so this is a wake up call and it's part of adapting is just being with us switch over how do you live and work and it's just part of life now so I guess we we all now go through the airport security and take off our shoes or whatever crazy protocols they have well that's just life and I think living in in a world where a virus can spread across the world that's gonna also change how we live and work so I think some of my delivery mechanisms some of my product offerings will that's definitely evolved because of that happy Friday and it's the end of the week stock markets crashed the cove in nineteen is now officially a pandemic so the world is coming to an end and I'm gonna do a zoom call to catch up with some people I got my full rig set up here got my Fuji camera microphone hooked up it's gonna call you a recorder very hardcore settings so I'm pumping out nice 1080p video I think we're all gonna have cabin fever foreseeable future don't know where the business is gonna go but we'll just have to figure it out it's probably the year down this week of all but still some positive moments here and there I think a lot of good contracts so we're gonna go through I've slowed down and so I think this is just something that the weather through just from a business perspective it was a bad time just our business but believe in myself I'm gonna double down and go hey have a good week thanks for joining the vlog hopefully we'll have some more positivity next week love y'all  you
