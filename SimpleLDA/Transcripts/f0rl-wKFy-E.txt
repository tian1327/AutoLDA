car it's so pretty but yeah I'm taking her car because why was I taking it I didn't want to drive down to DC in my car just because it has so many miles and this car was just sitting in the garage so I'm gonna take her car and I'm gonna be driving this when I'm in DC but the car is all loaded have all my stuff I have some stuff for my mom in the back that she wanted me to bring and then I have some snacks in case I get hungry and I don't really know what states are open because of quarantine so I don't know where I'd be able to get food if I was hungry or like where I'm gonna go to stop at the bathroom that I have almonds I have an apple I have some and then I also have like mighty that I just wanted to bring to DC so I had it but yeah those are my snacks hopefully I don't get too hungry I just had breakfast I had like a breakfast sandwich hope I'm good to go I have my tea my morning tea to wake me up also I started a I'm trying to figure out where I can put my camera it's so weird going from like my car to a new car and not knowing where to place the camera I guess that's good for now but I started a new podcast listening to a new podcast and it's called crime junkie and it's so good if you guys are into like crime and like murders and kidnapping and stuff like that it's all about that so each episode there is a new crime that's these two girls like walk you through and tell you like all the details and stuff and yeah I don't know I just love that stuff so I find it really interesting and they're around like 30 minutes each so I'm going to try to listen to as many as I can just to keep myself entertained on this road trip by myself alright I need to put in my GPS I'm so excited to see my mom I haven't seen her pretty much all of quarantine I saw her like right before quarantine started like really getting serious so I want to say it's been like through two three months so super excited to see her he's spent time with her and we're actually going to Florida for a week on the fifth so next week we're gonna go to Florida and they have an office there so I'm gonna be working out of like both offices just switching back and forth so excited for that excited to go to Florida gets son and just chillax alright let's see 317 and miles and it says it's gonna take me loading loading loading oh it's only gonna take me 5 hours and 26 minutes wow that's a lot shorter than I thought I don't know why I thought it was like 6 or 7 hours so 5 hours and at 30 ish minutes so I'll get there at 2:45 it's 9:20 right now so that isn't too bad hopefully I don't get like super hungry I'm really trying to not make a ton of stops because of Corona and all that I just don't want to have to stop a bunch of times but I do have my mask and gloves in case I need them I didn't really plan out how I was gonna film this video but I guess I'll just like update you guys maybe I'll let you listen to some of the podcasts with me and I get you guys an idea of what the podcast is going to pump my gas because I have no gas so I got my mask like a good girl I have this huge box of gloves that could last me like a year what as our world turned into it how is this the new normal alright BRB i literally filled it until the gas turned off I'm not sure why it's not all the way full but almost all right I am about two hours into my drive I just stopped at a rest stop to go to the bathroom I had to go to the bathroom so badly and I like cough and exit trying to find somewhere where a restroom would be open and then I couldn't so I got back on the highway and found a rest stop it with the bathroom and thank God cuz I was literally about to pull over and go in the woods it would have been so bad but I also got some snacks I got Pringles and sour skittles I know someone healthy but I was craving something unhealthy if you know what I mean um so yeah I'm like two hours in I'm gonna listen to the podcast I told you guys about the crime at junky podcast and let you guys listen along for a few minutes I believe that he didn't have his weekends so everyone's wondering believe desperate now as far as like why just staying uh no one but maybe it was just easier to get one kid into another country rather than three he's obviously comfortable even if they think they have better leads like Jorge because a big part of any investigation finding the truth but also closing all of the doors that each other you need things open-ended I mean that's exactly the kind of thing that can come up and for it and without for jurors the problem with closing this door though is that it's going to take a lot of Edberg they can make phone call and they do but dad's saying like hey she's not here doesn't do much it was gonna take months and months before they can actually get something down to Mexico to check this out once and for all I'm sorry if something child months to spare well you think they take their time because in the very early days as they start learning more about Jorge you seem more likely that he did have and dad was just a door that needed to be closed not actually where they were gonna find all right in Jersey I'm about two hours away my back just hurts so bad from sitting I feel like I kind of want to get out stretch but hang on to some music I just listened to like a bunch of podcasts and I'm kind of all podcast outs it definitely helps that when you're like going on a long car ride by yourself is it listen to podcast cause it keeps you entertained and  yeah I'm just some   I just got off the highway I pulled over to take a little break and I'm only like 20 minutes why stop gotta push through it but I'm just sitting here for a minute and I just saw it the craziest thing so I was on the highway cruising doing my thing and I'm passing this like big one of those like Peter Pan buses and you know how they have like all those compartments on the bottom of the bus is where you store like luggage or bags or whatever for the people that are riding the bus well all those compartments were just wide open in the backs we're just sliding everywhere I didn't see you back fall out but I'm sure bags were eventually falling out cuz they were just wide open flying in the highway and yeah it was like so funny but sad at the same time I cannot even imagine being on that bus and having my bag fly out in the middle of the highway I would be so annoyed and then like a mile down the road from that I was driving and there's this huge deer just laying in the middle of the highway like it must have just gone hey I must've been like so fresh cuz it was just laying there and it was so sad when I see roadkill I don't normally see like the full and I'm all like I usually see like a squirrel here and there like something small but like a big a deer I was like whoa this is a lot but I am a glad that I'm almost there I have eight minutes okay I'm gonna just get on the road and get there so I can settle in I'm gonna get off the crazy roads finally here I made it home sweet home for a month okay we have matching cars so cute hi well I feel like I haven't seen in a year my room for a month gotta get all unpacked look my mom we
