 Hindsight is 2020. I'll be narrating in
between the clips and videos of my travel vlog back home. Our journey begins
in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Hello! I'm going back home. Wait, I know what you're
thinking. Studying abroad during the Coronavirus Pandemic. But we're really all in this
together. If you look at the cases in the US versus the UK... However, in light of new
information, the circumstances have changed. The US government has said, "If
you wish to return the United States, you should make arrangements to do so now...
American students abroad should return to the United States as soon as possible.
Students abroad may face unpredictable circumstances, quarantine, and sudden
travel restrictions." After seeing this, I went and did some research. Turns out,
there's US citizens stuck in multiple countries across the world.  With less and
less flights offered from my international airport back to the US, I
decided that maybe I should come home. :( The next day, I booked a flight. Here we
go! I leave in two days. So, before we can get to the travel vlog, let's pack! Before we start, packing let's outline our trip. We have to fly from Newcastle to
Amsterdam, Amsterdam to Atlanta Georgia, then from Atlanta, Georgia, back home. The
only other option was to take a train from Newcastle to London. That would
about three hours, and as you'll see in a minute, that's less than ideal with the
amount of luggage we have. Therefore, we have four airports and three flights all
while trying to avoid a deadly microscopic, ratchet, ping-pong looking
virus. Let's pack. This is what we're working with.  
I'm going to be checking these two bags. This will be my carry-on. I'm going to ship
that one home, and then I'm going to use this backpack as my personal item.
*drops camera* Oh! Sorry about that. Oh hey look!
That was easy. Just have to wrap up this box. *explosion noise* Alright. So this is our look we're
going with. It is 43 degrees Fahrenheit. Obviously I'm wearing Gucci, Prada
Chanel, Versace. Got the goggles to make sure don't touch my eyes, antiviral wipes,
and hand sanitizer. Let's head to the airport. That leads us to airport number
one, the Newcastle International Airport. Right off the bat, I end up getting
pat-down by security because I tried to go through the metal detector with my
student ID in my pocket, which of course has electronics in it. So I make it through
security, and this place is closed down. There's not a single shop open. No place
to buy food. No place to buy water. It's pretty bare. The only place you could get
a snack was this vending machine that was so old the glass was yellow. I've
been to this Airport just a month and a half prior. Everything was completely
open. So this was quite the shock to see. Looks like we're the only flight today. I get on the plane and I notice that the
overhead bin compartment is pretty small. I try to fit my carry-on luggage in, and
it won't fit. So then I try to slide it underneath the seat.
It won't fit as well. O.0 So I turned my luggage sideways. I take both my feet and
I push it underneath as hard as I can. I push it in so hard, the seat in front
of me raises up a little bit with the guy on his seat. He didn't say anything. I
didn't say anything. Since the luggage was completely underneath, the the flight
attendants didn't say anything. Crisis averted. As part of social distancing, instead of
handing us snacks, they had these little boxes of food in the back of the plane.
As soon as we got high enough and the plane began to level out, they let us get
out of our seats one by one and then grab ourselves our little box of food. On this
flight there were definitely more people than I thought. It was about a quarter
full. They let one or two people move so that they weren't sitting right next to
each other. They wouldn't let everyone sit wherever they want because the plane
was so small, they had to keep the weight balanced. Then we landed at airport
number two, The Amsterdam Airport Of course it took me a few minutes to get
my bag out from underneath the seat. So I get off the plane, and go to the flight
monitor, and my flights not there. There's a flight to Miami 
but it leaves a few hours later than what's on my ticket. I go and check the app, and it says my
flight already left. So I start panicking, freaking out. I'm thinking might as well
head to the gate has the later flight to Atlanta because I'll probably be
getting on that one anyway, if my flights already left. I get to the
gate, and it's my flight. On time!! I don't get why it wasn't on the monitor, and my
flight said it had already left. After I realized everything's a-okay I took a
walk around the airport. Most places were still open.
There was definitely hardly any people anywhere. It was pretty crazy just to
walk around and see how empty this huge international airport is. Around the
airport they had seats blocked off. Every three or four seats were blocked off with
tape to encourage social distancing. So, flight number 2, Amsterdam to Atlanta.
Still, there were more people than I thought. The plane was at least a quarter
full. Once again, the flight attendants let people move their seat if they were
sitting right next to somebody. As long as they stayed in their section,
in their section of economy. Everyone got in settled pretty quick, and up and away
we were to Atlanta. This was a usual flight. I watched a few movies. After they
served us food, I took a nap. They served us food seven hours apart though.
 an hour after we got into the air and then an hour
before we landed. That's on me though, I should have bought more food at the
airport. I also thought this all-encompassing outlet was pretty cool.
Before we landed, they gave us this CDC Health Forum as we approached the
airport. It was pretty simple, not too many questions. An hour later and we land
at airport number three, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International
Airport. As soon as I got off the plane, they had these CDC officers that we had
to hand our forms that we filled out to. Otherwise they didn't stop and do any
personal investigations or anything. So, right as I get off the plane, I look at
the monitor. My flight is there. I pick up my bags  go through customs and
immigration. I get on the other side of all the security. I look at the monitor
again, and my flight's not there. I asked one of the airport employees standing
nearby that's helping people with their flights if she could help me find my
flight on the board. It wasn't there. She looks at my flight number on her little
iPad thing, and she says my flight is at, "Gate A, as in Apple, 36." So I repeat back
to her, "A, as an Apple, 36." She said, "Yes, you'll go downstairs to the
right." I go downstairs to the right, and I have to get on The Plane Train from
terminal F to Terminal A. So, after four stops, I head upstairs and look for my
gate. There're gates 31 to 34. So, I'm figuring
if it's gate "36" it's probably gate 34. Maybe I misheard her. Maybe she misspoke.
I don't really know. So I'm walking to the gate. I take a little video. There're
still definitely more people. There're no seats blocked off. There're still places
closed here and there. That could be because it was so late in the day.
Otherwise, it's just pretty interesting to see the difference in people at the
airport. So I get to my gate, and the flights already boarded. I drop my ticket
as I go to hand it to the flight attendant. So I pick it up. I'm just so
nervous. I immediately board, and then 20 minutes
later we're off into the air. Flight number free  three.
Up, up, and away we were. I was so excited at this point Homestretch! The plane was still about a
quarter full. Definitely more than I thought. I thought these planes were
gonna be just about empty. So nothing too exciting. We land and pull
up to the gate. When the seatbelt light comes off, everybody stands up in the
aisle and are breathing down each other's necks. At this point social
distancing just went absolutely out of the window. I was so disgusted. DISGUSTING.
And that leads us to our final airport, Airport number four. Enjoy this clip of
me very sleep-deprived. These bags under my eyes are Prada. This last airport was the most empty by far. It seemed as though the only flight
coming to this Airport were the people on my flight. Out of the ten luggage
carousels, the one from my flight was the only one in use. Thankfully, my bags came
out first. So I grabbed my luggage, ran outside,  waited for a few minutes for my
dad to come pick me up. We drove around the airport a little bit to see how
empty it was. As you can see from the footage, its scarily empty like some sort
of horror movie where everyone's gone. It's almost as if there's a worldwide
pandemic going on. Which leads us to today. Hello. It's been four days since
I've returned home. I feel pretty good. As far as my reflections on this whole
experience, I really miss England. I miss my flatmates. I miss all my classes
before they were canceled. I miss the international community. All these
students, they would have these events and parties that I would go to that they
would advertise for international students. Everyone I met was so
incredibly nice and welcoming. I made so many friends. I really miss them, but it
was really time for me to come home. In self-isolation I wasn't sleeping very
well. I wasn't eating much. Already I've gotten a lot of rest. I'm eating better,
eating well. I feel better. Overall though, I'm just glad I'm safe and healthy.
Finishing all my classes is still kicking my butt, but considering everything, it
could be worse. Thanks for watching! If you would like to check out my channel,
