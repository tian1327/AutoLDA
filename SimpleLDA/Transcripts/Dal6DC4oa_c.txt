 hello everyone happy Thursday I'm gonna put this up a little bit um I just wanted to come on and say hello and intro this vlog and talk to you guys about the amazing exciting jewelry that I'm wearing so yeah let me just talk about it because I feel like I'm gonna get so many questions so I am so excited and in love with this jewelry I got three pieces from a brand that is local in New York which just makes it so much more exciting for me because I feel like especially now I personally want to support any local business in New York any businesses locally are suffering so if you attend support a local business in your hometown please try to they are the ones that are suffering the most and it's just so sad to see so many businesses having to close because of cop√°n 19 so when this brand reached out to me I was really excited to support and talk about them as much as I can the brand is called Ana Luisa and they are a new york-based jewelry company it's amazing because they are actually super sustainable everything is handmade locally in New York with sustainable materials and I just feel like it makes you feel good about wearing the jewelry and supporting it even more I keep showing you my show you the two pieces so I actually got three but I'm wearing two of them right now and I've never had a earring like the second one here it's kind of like a cuff but it is obviously a full earring I do have double piercings but fun fact I've never really found an earring that I'd like love to keep as a stable second piercing fun till these and I feel like I want to interchange this first one a lot and keep the second one I just love how it kind of hugs my ear more like a ear cuff would I also like that it kind of higher up so sometimes when I wear a double double earring here it kind of drips down second and it kind of overshadows the first earring that I'm wearing not the case here so yeah I got the three items and the mail the other day they come in these really awesome little velvet pouches which is also great for traveling so I'm wearing two of them and I'm show you the third there like a braided hoop there gold of course I'm a big gold girl I don't wear any silver jewelry at all I just feel like I like the look of gold I'm so excited to talk to you guys about them because of course I always talk about stuff where you can get it at a

purchasing it again just because it's sustainable and it's local you're from New York and you want jewelry that's affordable please this is your spot so let's get on with the vlog because this is a random MIT mismatch vlog of the last I literally want to say three weeks I've just been picking up the vlog camera really randomly and throughout just like days that I just feel like logging so it's kind of a mismatched vlog and I will try to get better again I promise I promise I promise but I've actually been super busy with work which I'm so lucky because I know that is a true blessing right now so um but yeah I just been having I just been so crammed my days have been so busy that I feel like I literally don't have time to vlog but this is a whole bunch of clips for the from the past like three weeks and enjoy the vlog and I'll see you guys in a second and it's like a week ago my time but you'll see me in just a second so okay enjoy hello friends how is it going I'm still at my parents house so much has been going on like honestly like a lot has been going on you know I haven't really left my house the dates today is April 21st if you live in New York or in the New York area you know the what they're calling it like a pause or social distancing basically all non-essential workers are ordered to work from home so they're calling it like this pause they extended that to May 15th originally it was until the end of April so they extended it 15 more days so I'm basically going to be at my parents house until then I who knows if they're going to extend it again I kind of think they might to the end of May and if they do we'll play it by ear but it might be staying at my parents look in a little bit longer so I don't know I'm just taking it day by day it's so crazy to read the news and see what's going on but I mean whether I'm here or in New York I still have to work from home and stay inside so I think the less travel I do and that time the better so for now I'm just gonna be my parents house which brings me to what I've been doing in my room I don't know if I put a clip of the finished dresser maybe I did but um guys it's fully done I got some new fake plans from Target cuz I'm crazy but um yeah dressers done I think I showed you guys a clip but I don't know if I had these so these are just some fake flowers from Target a fake plant these are the books my parents had this was a candle for my sister's wedding lotion I had my house just the jewelry I brought and then I'm so excited to show you my homemade very homemade very put-together death focus tada so let me tell you about this these are like stands that you likes and stuff on or you use to like chop wood these are from my basement they're real ugly like plastic little things and on top are two pieces of wood that are leaves in two different tables so they're different colors all three of these things were in my basement and I just put them together I put some more fake flowers some other books my computer my keyboard this is a lamp that was out in the sitting room out here a candle and it's my workstation and I'm from honest from right here it's pretty cute ding I love it I honestly if you like are kind of far away it looks like a desk like it looks like a desk with legs also that's art kitchen table chair and a pillow I'm sitting on cuz there's my vibe um if you look at it from here it looks like it's like it's a regular table I was working downstairs in the dining room and then I moved to like this side table that we had but overall it was just a little distracting like my parents were in and out Wrigley was there I feel like I was looking around the house a lot more I kept getting up to go to the to go to the fridge I kept snacking and then this last week I started working from my bed which no no no no not good you shouldn't work from the place that you sleep I learned that quickly so I didn't mind being in my room all day I just couldn't keep working from my bed so I was like you know what I'm not gonna go order something cuz I mean I don't know how long I'm gonna be here but I'm not gonna order a whole table and a whole desk so I put that together and I have to say I am thoroughly impressed and I've been enjoying it I think it's really cute I like really like it I feel like I'm going to work you know like my bedroom is my bedroom like relaxing and

many days mom ago 41 I've been home for 41 days and again very excited about it and we'll film and we're back to today so it is about 10 o'clock and I'm going to make some breakfast and I thought I would add a little bit more food to this vlog and show you guys what I make for breakfast this varies every single day sometimes I get in the rhythm of doing like a sandwich like an egg sandwich sometimes I do cereal some mornings I just do eggs and toast yogurt that's pretty much it but today I'm going to do eggs and toast with a little bit of this salsa that I am obsessed with I'll show you guys I'm gonna get the ingredients and I'll be right back okay so umm I'm going to make two eggs and a little bit of Parmesan cheese and they're two pieces of toast this is homemade of bread from my dad if you've been following me on instagram you know he's been cooking this entire quarantine he always cooks obviously but he's been like putting it on Instagram huh but he's are making bread because we have so much time so the best bread in the entire world I swear to god this is just I think like an Italian loaf but he does a sourdough that is incredible and then this is the salsa that I put on my eggs with toast it's actually a guacamole mix it's from Frontera is the brand and it's just the normal Wacom only mix there is one that is like a spicy version it's fine for whatever reason though this is just better I do make this with avocado and make it like a guacamole sometimes but it's really good just right on eggs it's like a salsa with tomatillo I think it's just homo Telos green chilies and garlic it's so good okay so while my toast is toasting or I should say my bread is toasting um thanks are done I didn't time it very well so bread is in the toaster and then I'll just have this on the side it'll be delish okay I put a lot of sauce on because I'm obsessed with this and I can't get enough and I just buttered some bread and I'll eat it and it's going to be phenomenal so that's my breakfast happy eating hello friends it is later in the day and I am now editing the vlog you're watching so I thought I would just outro it I am so tired and I need to desperately wash my hair wolf but I hope you enjoyed this random mismatch of vlog with random little clips and little updates here and there yeah I hope you guys are doing well and you're staying safe
