 hey guys what's going on shut them up today I want to give you guys a little bit of a tour of what it is like in New York City Chinatown because you know New York City has been infected with this corona virus recently and just wanted to show you around so we're going into the supermarket right now because supermarkets actually we're the only stores openly so as of last night the mayor shut down bars and restaurants gyms as well so pretty much the only establishment open at this point restaurants are only for take-out so pretty much the only establishments actually open at this point are supermarkets so Hong Kong supermarket is open for business right here and let's go in find out what's going on they're also selling lots of fake masks for sale also full body suits Tyvek suits industrial sized professional sprayer gloves Clorox bleach an entire wall of face masks a lot so as you can see the supermarkets right now least in Chinatown we're pretty full which sort of makes sense because supermarkets are like one of the only stores now that's actually allowed to remain open in New York City so yeah a lot of people here most American masks can kind of come into the 50 eyes  a lot of people say there's actually no evidence of mass protect you from run of ours but actually not really true there is um actually a lot of evidence that that masks and protect roof one of the major sources of iris mission which is chocolates so this is food surgical masks well and 95 masks are better but surgical masks do also offer a certain amount of protection not it's not 100% but it definitely does do something so don't believe that when people say masks don't do anything because they definitely do and I think that's one of the reason why one reasons why in a lot of Asian countries there are lower lower infection rates right now and then so my secretaries and noticing more people here than usual both Chinese people but also a lot of non Chinese people as well which is things you don't really have so many non Chinese people in the supermarket usually so though the stalks are actually relatively full right now I mean some stuff is gone like looks like rice here is all gone you know rightful good thing to buy in times of crisis but otherwise otherwise it seems actually relatively relatively clear which is kind of nice though otherwise this place it is actually parading as normal like you know I got me you got your there's fresh Meads you got your process meet your drink you know a lot a lot of stuff looks looks business as usual here in China I'm just getting some food here to bring home cashiers to notice sir wearing not only Mahaska also gloves which it's actually not unusual for Chinatown a lot of people who stores here actually normally wear stuff like this so people here are accustomed to just sort of outfit so we got our stuff guys from the tent town supermarket and now we're gonna go to Whole Foods so honest personal notice are just closed down  it's like not open restaurants like bake shop bakeries and stuff are all closed this is the streets for the most part emptier than than usual like usually there's a lot more people out in Chinatown but you know as you can see like just lots of shops and restaurants are just closed looks like spas are open here their stylists are still open okay you'll also see as well especially in this neighborhood a lot of people wearing masks a lot a lot a lot so just along this street you know most stuff fiercely close some things are open like bakeries and noticed a couple bakeries open flowers our store is still up because everybody needs their flowers your teeth t Guinea and your teeth get your tea here so this is the the park usually you know school will be letting out right now but the schools are closed down too so this park is completely empty and it's it's it's really crazy just because usually there are so so many people here and there's almost nobody in this park now I mean if you look down here there's like a few people playing handball or something basketball but there's no students all the students are at this school which is closed and everybody's just kind of gone home there's usually lots of old people here to just kind of sitting around but they're also they're also going home I'm doing like I'm like a Chinatown block I'm telling people like what's going on so spooky so spooky yeah you too now a lot of people in New York right now are thinking that like Chinatown is somehow unsafe because you know the virus came from China so of course 10 pounds could be unsafe but um that's actually a misconception as well first of all because 99.9999% of Chinese people here and actually now % food here are not from China like directly because Chinese flights are banned so it's not like this Chinese people from China coming here and infecting New York City Chinatown with viruses it's not happening and number two maybe the more important reason is that in my opinion near treated Chinatown is actually one of the safer places to be right now in New York City and I think that I think that people here are taking extreme precautions like we just saw in the supermarket how people are buying like like full-body hazmat suits and EMS so I think people here are taking a lot of precautions as far as you know virus prevention goes and so I think that actually Chinatown is one of the safer places could be in New York City right now despite the fact that it looks so much like it's under quarantine like everybody's wearing masks and stuff like that I think that actually means that it's going to be safer than most places in in New York City also people in general are trying to wash their hands some restaurants that are that are you know putting extra efforts to do this affecting stuff etc now this is the most incredible thing this woman over here you see always sell stuff at thread this corner and she's just the most amazing woman because whatever the the time is the temperature is she's always out there selling stuff let's go let's go buy something from her and see how she's uh she's been doing he's just like such a fixture of the neighborhood and you know hope she's doing okay hello okay my gamma huh hey Miami what such a  you got different songs am i okay what you might Maya okay 13:13 in the Curan you milk sir - I'm up   Pingu de Xiang it was the current super su Chou even me your digital healthy food I'm gonna date a nice to help me call Joe Manchin yah yah yah yah yah yah yah honey gonna die streets were on the road homes streets also parks are all really empty there's some cars on the street but you know most people are working from home right now we're not working at all hotels there there so we are now in funky you know for the most part it actually looks pretty normal I would say there's some mask-wearing but not quite as much as the chinatown definitely some sparseness Michelle so like you need to get when you get some bread but there's only one loaf I'm Brad here so take the one loaf it's a lot of flowers that's one kind of thing was awesome today plenty of flowers also lots of vegetables so if you're a vegetable fan good news lots of fruits vegetables for you to eat definitely plenty of cheese candy cheese there giver and say you got it but when we come to the meat aisle oh my god all the sausages are gone completely gone Wow it's the chicken all the new products are just like it empty even the fake meat man you know things are bad when even the fake meat is gone not to dis fake meat I actually really like fake me but supplies of bacon running dangerously low it's not good Wow even look even the fresh yeah look at that running them low a little oh here I'll have some fish it looks like man and here see it some deep deep drops in canned food like peanut butter and such a little bit of fish left we're running really low with pasta all all types of pasta it's very very low right now and this place is a disaster guys thank you oh look at this this is like crackers are just gone anything that people want to stock up on for an emergency it's like downtown Chinatown and I don't even know what was supposed to be but whatever it was completely oh paper towels right some refreezing guys people are masked on paper towels which it's so stupid why is it like that the one thing that you're worried about running out of during an epidemic like at worst the use napkins guys come on even this even though it didn't like all that dog bucket dog treats and suffered it's totally gone still got plenty of capital of crooks or Lacroix never really knew how to pronounce that there is here is just you know just like nothing like pizza ice cream stuff is getting clobbered anything that's like easy to prepare is just getting run down okay got what I need it to get from Whole Foods I'm going back home I'm gonna cook some food and in general you know what it looks like the Chinese supermarkets a little bit too old it's better in terms of supplies actually a lot better all right see you guys the next time
