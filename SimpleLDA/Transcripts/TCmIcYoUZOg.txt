   domi I freaking love packing and I love doing things I love like paying for the travel but I don't know something I think it's the nerves and I think it's not knowing what to expect when I get to the airport and I think it's just I've been waiting for this moment for so long that I literally just want to get myself into the bag and go and I'm like go away I'm on so I not how serious is this thing because we're lots of travel America hasn't put a ban on us yet so I don't know what to do hey guys so I'm in bed ready to go sleep Sunday night now as opposed to fly out on to Thursday to go and visit my boyfriend who's been away in New York for about three and a bit months now so I haven't seen him for quite a long time and I'm supposed to go visit him now the president of South Africa has just spoken and said that she advises against travel to the USA and Europe and China advises against international travel force Africa basically it's not a band so the airline for now is telling me that they won't give me a refund and they won't move the flight because there's no ban on travel so I'm going to hit there in the morning see what I can do see when I'm flying see what I'm happening see if I if I am flying they hit there early in the morning and see what happens but it's quite a scary time and not emotional because I really want to see him and I don't know if he's gonna be able to come back either so but anyway I guess I'm sitting in my suitcase because I had literally done I went to back like the tree just want to pack myself in my bag and Mail me off to go see him in New York the morning are flying today um so it's Tuesday today flying a hopless one from Johannesburg the venom and I'm flying eight hours to Dubai then from Dubai I'm flying 14 hours to JFK in New York so that's why I thought to tire myself out and to get me refreshed and to feel good for this long 24 hours day of flying almost 24 hours I would go for a quick jog do a quick homework heart and then to the airport let's see if we have any problems the airline isn't giving me a refund so I'm gonna go ahead and although I've just come back from my little jockey jog and now today my ears look a bit funny because of a mask so I got to the airport this morning and I wrapped my bag and everything and then I get to check-in and she says where you going so I stayed in New York there's like I don't think you're gonna have to go because you're not you're not a u.s. citizens you're not going home so then they took my passport and they ran this is like up to headquarters which other said I'm fine to pass through so my bags being pass through to New York so yeah I'm through custom is now possible controls and I'm on the other side well I just made it to my boyfriend's apartment after like a whole day of flying he just checked our temperature at the airports because I didn't come from Ohio's country like China or Europe as Lars passed through customs and then I literally finished three bottles of hand sanitizer on this journey alone that I bought in South Africa and then there's literally like there's not a single piece of hand sanitizer I can find anyway in America so I'm really scared now because when I got out and he to hand sanitizers when I get on the subway and stuff but luckily I just randomly walked into Carlo's Bakery for cannoli and they were something hand sanitizer so it's ready to go and I'll let you guys know how the journey goes of Mike hope in my teen traveling but I'm really excited I was so excited when it pops out on the subway first solo into the rock station so my boyfriend took forever to find me because I was lost so cool seeing him and stuff but anyway talk to you later guys so this big glass bowling there is the job it's Convention Center and across the road there's lots of music news reporters because this is becoming a corona field hospital okay this station is actually pretty busy but nothing answered goodnight so besides work around Central Park super dark aren't you the only one bad thing about walking on Jan hours it's starting to rain oh now it's like coming down in buckets oh yes we are yep because the cocoa is yet some exploring and being out today back at the apartments so as you saw there setting up a crow in a field hospital and all the museums museums and things are closed so we can't go into museums but you can see the sights on the outside and then we just stood to Central Park exploring so now we're gonna head to a friend's apartment we're gonna go play some games get a bit drunk and just enjoy our evening and then walk slowly back to the apartment yeah because as you can't go out to bars and clubs and stuff so because of the corona they want you kind of to stay indoors and stay at home so we're gonna go friends who my boyfriend works with who he sees all the time sort of safe around each other so yeah we're just gonna take a leisurely walk out there but we spent the night together before going out so yeah see you guys there yeah it's so creepy there's no one there's no one a huge ass rat to just right in front of us okay there's two other people's civilization and a taxi is another rat there's another rat oh  there's more there's more this more in front of the Empire State Building look there it is all lit up and he has the bottom of Empire States hey guys my boyfriend's busy work he he works in this building yeah well he lives there sorry so I'm just gonna go explore what's copy I'm gonna go to explore New York events look Don Bosco's Occulus town home ice at the World Trade Center so we're eating a famous New York slice from Joe's pizza stand to a Liberty so we just did some last-minute exploring today we went into our doorway to the make choices and we were in sort of out of Manhattan and then we did like late night exploring around the mint the walks are on there the one thing about being in New York at this time is that you get such spectacular photos compared to photos on the past because so M see so you don't have to wait in queues and you can take your time and set up your photos and just really get into it and see the city in a different vibe it's really scary and really weird but it is different so when you act out at the mint oysters I got a phone call to say that Emirates has just informed the world and South Africa that they're canceling all their international flights and that they have one more flight going out tomorrow tomorrow morning back to South Africa and I have to be on that flight so I've spent only five days now here in New York with my boyfriend so hopefully he comes back and asks you into this Africa but I don't know what's gonna happen but basically I am heading to the airport tomorrow morning to JFK to get on the Emirates flights back to South Africa because apparently so Africa is entering a lockdown from Thursday night 12 o'clock South Africa's entering a lockdown 20 days 21 days no one can leave their homes don't go outside all flights are being canceled international and domestic so I basically have to go back Moritz has also advised that they'll be doing screenings they want to spring hand sanitizer and masks so I've got my mouse prepared I've got my hand sanitizer from Carlos um yeah I'm just very sad to leave them of course cuz I'm not sure when I'm gonna see him again and I'm not sure what's gonna happen with New York City it's getting emptier and emptier and the cases just keep going up and up and South Africa when I left Bailey had cases and they've really burned into a lot not so scary travelling at the moment when I flew here you could scan you get past people stare two passports forever wondering if you want the high-risk country list it's just it wasn't an easy journey that wasn't fun like it easily as traveling it's just very uncomfortable you feel so wrong doing it the whole time but let's see what happens      so I finally made it back home now from airport happened was we landed in South Africa at 4 o'clock then we sat on the runway for an hour and a half then when we taxied the health officials came onto the plane that took about two hours they scanned us all then they took our forms we had to say which countries you came from and the high cut the high-risk countries were according to South Africa USA Europe or China and obviously I just come from the USA then we got off the plane scanned again for our temperature then they told us that we will be going to hotel for quarantine for 14 days so we're like okay cool that's okay but then two hours passed no one's telling us anything nothing's happening we aren't going to quarantine they're not letting us get our bags we want our bags they not letting us use phones to tell our parents where we are to tell family what's happening that you can't pick us up because we're going to quarantine the bus onto the buses aren't arriving to take us and basically I have a u.s. SIM card in my phone so it's not working so I can't tell my parents what the hell's happening eventually they tell us then they haven't provided provided us with food or water the plane journey eight hours from Dubai to Johannesburg they didn't give us food they only gave us stuff to drink on the plane so we haven't eaten for almost eight hours now a whole day we just flown 14 hours from JFK to Dubai they provide us with water there's wine glass on a table and a jug of water and you want us to share a glass and one jug of water between a plane that had almost 400 passengers on it they told us that we might go to a govern government facility and that we won't be allowed to take our bags with us and then also we started seeing people that were on the same flight with us being allowed to leave and exit the airport because they didn't come from a high-risk country but they were so on the plane with us so they've still been in contact with potential carriers so that was that started some rioting and some singing and people getting up in arms so those are some of the videos that I took off for people dancing and singing and protesting against the way we were treated now in the airport and then after that they tell us okay no we're allowed to go home and if we solve quarantine that was seven hours after he landed finally got my bags finally to my parents the airport was so empty it was so weird the ghosts on this no one we were the only plane on the information board I think we were the only plane that came in that day international domestic flights had already been canceled it's insane and then my boyfriend informed me that he would be coming so tonight is Monday night Tuesday night I mean sorry and he is coming on Thursday he'll be landing at 10 o'clock and the lockdown starts at 12 o'clock on Thursday so he's coming in just in time I'm not sure what's gonna happen with him and self-quarantine iing and all that stuff I'm hoping he's able to come out the airport but it was pardon ordeal quite scary and we weren't treated very well but hey but anyway thanks guys for watching knows my journey quite unique very scary and the world is in a very tough time at the moment bye guys
