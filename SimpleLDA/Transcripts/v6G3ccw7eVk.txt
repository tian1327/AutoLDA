just gonna head out here in just a second mom where we going for breakfast or actually at lunch we're gonna talk about that the Sun is out it's nice and bright like a light we ain't gonna fight but anyways like I said we have a long list of things to do today some of it will be winging it again which is OK the ball is looking real nice this morning make your day I think that the tick tock ad Hey look there's tick tock right there but the building is covering it in the building built in 1915 yeah something like that breakfast time some good cream cheese  alright guys we just finished our bagels they were really good probably the best cream cheese bagel that I've ever had a plan applied the subway for the first time in my life these guys have already done it quite a bit but I have never done it so let's see what this is all about yours  so what are we waiting for we need the free drink hold over all about to get on the Staten Island Ferry a lot of people Oh waiting room to await the next bearer all passengers must be very the Staten Island Ferry was super fun got to see the Statue of Liberty and now we're gonna go right the subway to the One World Trade Center and check out the memorial so I'll see you guys there it was literally Jake we missed it we missed the subway right as we walked down here it left let's play how long are we gonna wait because that's the end of the track down there the subway stops down there and then goes the other way because we're all the way uptown downtown downtown in New York City there's basically just no directions it's just like I guess I'm just directionally challenged the train just got back it's only been like three minutes oh well we've been sitting on this train for like ten minutes and it has not gone okay we're moving now what is this place called the oculus Wow we got straight off the subway and it spits you out here and this really cool filets I didn't even know existed but hello Steve oculus it's a big mall apparently and I want some Starbucks but yeah this place looks awesome got my coffee and we're set so guys we couldn't see the memorial because they closed it off so we could only see it from a distance and I'm not allowed to video in that area just because it's disrespectful to the memorial and so I don't have any footage of that which is okay and so now we're gonna walk to Alexander Hamilton's grave and that's gonna be awesome I can't wait for that so I'll see you guys there quick update my head got really cold so I just gotta be me and it says NYC and now my head is warm that's it guys we can't go into the cemetery but there it is Alexander Hamilton was buried right there this is like kind of surreal I'm looking at Alexander Hamilton's grave this is crazy it's a really big one of the biggest graves in the cemetery and I really wish we could go in and see it but we're on the other side of this fence and the Schuyler sisters are also buried here Robert Fulton Fulton oh that's supposed to be a you anyways guys there it is Alexander Hamilton's grave I just want to start rapping to Hamilton now honestly I am NOT throwing away my shot I'm not throwing away my shot and you know I'm just like my country I'm young scrappy hook again I'm not throwing my church right behind you it's really a beautiful building but yeah guys so we're at Giuliana's Pizza now in Brooklyn across the Brooklyn Bridge earlier and check out this piece of guys it looks so good this pizza place was rated the number one pizza place in the USA between 2015 and 2018 so that's pretty legit so we just finished eating at Giuliana's pizza and I personally would give it like a three point six seven out of five what would you give it out of five three point six seven what would you give it out of five four yeah it was really good it wasn't the best buta I've ever had I personally didn't mind that anyways guys so we're gonna go to this really famous picture spot on Washington Street in Water Street so I will show you guys that all right guys we're at the famous Washington and Water Street viewpoint and I got me some ice cream I'm fat lots of people come here to take pictures and I'll show you just because you see this bridge and if you get in the middle of the road you can get the Empire State Building right in the middle of the bridge underneath I'll show you guys sumed in in a second but I'm kind of holding this ice cream so it's really hard to film hey mom but Allah is taking a picture can you press the stop button on my video okay so my zoomin as much as I can the Empire State Building is like centered right there in the middle so that's why this place is famous but there's a lot of better pictures than what I can really get but yeah that's the Empire State Building right there I'll show you guys a really good picture of this place by the way queue it right now and hatton across the across the bridge it's gonna be about a mile walk or so a little more but ya guys all right guys all right guys so we're walking in the middle of the highway bars on this side and cars on this side and we've made it to the wooden part which means now about to go over the water the water smells like it smells like sewage but we're making our way guys all right guys  I should do a 10 hour time lapse of cars driving by just kidding I'm not going to do that the feminine news right here - two different guys  hey you guys already seen it okay okay I apologized for that I don't know what I was on for that like three seconds but I'm actually gonna be able to do today's vlog in one part which is cool I just kind of cut down the videos to very specific little portions of everything so I think we're actually gonna get dinner at chick-fil-a in New York City so I can compare it to like how the check plays at home and how it is here I think it's not gonna be as good see you guys they still got Jesus's kitchen in New York as we just got all right guys we just got our chick-fil-a they gave us these weird bags to put our drinks in which is kind of strange but we're gonna chow down here the service was not as good as it is in Texas no which was kind of expecting that but anyways guys thank you for watching today's vlog today's vlog was awesome today was just super fun in general every day has been fun I say that at the end of every blog but thanks again and I will see you
