 I miss this I want to like a girl with my friends outside look at your quarantine style what school doesn't look too crowded that's right that's a relief Wow well this sure did escalate quickly been there hey everyone it is sarah i am coming at you from the balcony of my apartment where i have not left for several days i'm living here in quarantine in NYC and i'm sure many of you are also living in quarantine if you haven't i really suggest you do to help prevent the spread of this virus and to help us get over it quicker Louie and I have been in our apartment for a few days now and I wanted to show you what a day in the life is like today we're going to be doing a few different things including going to the grocery store which will be an adventure I am sure of it we haven't been out in a few days tell me in the comments what is your experience been like living in quarantine today on the schedule on the quarantine schedule we're gonna go to the grocery store which is always a adventure it's the only time that we leave the house is to go to the grocery store so I always like to get dressed for that because I have nowhere else to get dressed for boom and then I'm going to be doing a live interview on Instagram so I will be interviewing one of my friends who has Co vid 19 he's in Berlin and so I'll be doing a live and then after that I'll probably work a bit work out and watch a movie or something  all right we are headed to a grocery store run and I haven't been out of my pajamas all day so I put on this like yellow blazer cuz you know now we're you know this is the only place I have to go today and so this is what I'm going to be wearing so now I'm gonna put my makeup on because I've been told that you should make your day as normal as possible so I'm going to try to be doing that right now the gym in our building has been shut down - looking forward to yeah we were really looking forward to having a gym and being able to work out and the quarantine and now we can't do that because the gym has been shut down so that sucks there's surprisingly still a good amount of people on the street honestly it seems like it's pretty normal yeah if some people are being like cautious which is like great to do right but some people just kind of get stir-crazy and just want to get outside anyways I mean the essentials are shopping you're going to the hospital and stuff like that so yeah the things you can do or should do if you can is go grocery shopping cuz otherwise you gotta be hungry yeah it's very true but here's like how many people are out right now it's not that many now so for those of you that are wondering why we're not wearing masks because we don't have any but we're not sick so I heard that the mess only are good if you're sick I guess I'm not sure I'm not a medical expert so I'm just doing what I'm just saying what I heard on the internet that's all so here's a sign that you've been seeing a lot like things closed or it on a different schedule let's go oh it doesn't look too crowded that's right that's a relief we were here like two days ago it wasn't like empty I feel like some of the videos you see online show it like completely empty it wasn't like that how does it look let's see it's probably it's like rice pasta that's supposedly not there looks okay to me wow this looks good there's tons of stuff okay we get some food there's tons of stuff it's not empty Louie makes amazing bread by the way yeah I think you should just make your own bread it's gonna take like three hours and I don't have that kind of time really you don't have that kind of time right now it's so update this grocery store it's it's like definitely not not stock but it's kind of a mess they're working on stocking it right now so if you look right here it's like boxes are everywhere and this is how every single aisle looks what are you trying to make today Louie we make goulash but I'm gonna make it like a vegetarian one yeah I bet it with me yes we're trying to eat less but there is meat in the store there's me there's some meat but I don't really want to eat meat so bad so I was just told by the manager to stop recording so I think you get the idea it's a little it's definitely different than the other store normally is but I'm gonna let it go see you later  right now I'm Lily no line  all right we just left the grocery store we have see the bags thank ya the grocery store it was just like very like unorganized because the restocking things so quickly that they don't have time to like everything on the shelves so I think that was like shocking to see because I've never seen that in a grocery store before but they are filling up and everything and restock there's food there's tons of food it's just they have clearly have like triple the amount of workers that they normally do oh yeah and then they just are they're getting shipments and so quickly that they haven't even been able to stock the shelves fully that's something you don't see on the streets of New York often okay so I just got back from the store so now I just like wash my hands and I'm just going to use this cuz again we just moved in things everywhere I haven't done the dishes and they say you should do it for 20 seconds I'm also gonna clean my camera because my hands touched all over my camera and I want to make sure that that is clean too so I'm going to be using they are French lavender scented so they're really nice and they sanitize so let's clean the camera with this right now well first I realized I should clean my phone too so so if your phone is so filled with germs normally and yes I know my case is humongous Louie got it for me it's a battery saving case whoa all right so I'm gonna clean my camera since it has literally been all over everything while I'm cleaning it let me tell you about my camera that I love so much I have the G H 5 and I'm just wiping down every single place so this is the receiver and this is the Mike part so I'm just going to wipe this down as well trying to stay positive I think they're a lot of people start being up so many creative ideas that they can do and I mean if you think about it Isaac Newton invented calculus during a pandemic Jane Austen broke the book Emma which was turned into the movie clueless so these are all things that have happened when people get stuck inside and I think that because we live in a virtual world there's so much more opportunity for us because imagine if we didn't have internet they'll be a nightmare this is my Joby tripod cool done okay it is time for a call with Henrik Henrik is my friend from Berlin I met him on a press trip and he's a tour guide there and he actually has Colvin 19 so I think he has a really positive outlook about it and I think he's a great example so I wanted to I want to show people what it's like because I can't speak to it certainly then we're gonna do this Instagram live just to kind of show people what it's like to have Kovan 19 he has been he's had it for about a week or two now I'm not sure he's gonna talk about it so yeah let's do this oh my god hello you are on vacation mode right here yes I love it what Corona  you have the best attitude about having Corona that is why I like wanted to talk to you because I think you will settle a lot of people's nerves about the fears of koban 19 yeah all right further questions for Henrik you can message him through his Instagram he is just chilling at home living it up the best you can and staying positive I love that about you alright thanks for home for tuning in and if you like bee lives can't let me know and I'll do more live like this alright thank you  I'll cook it's going great Sarah did all most of the work already but now we're just gonna try to get a little bit more liquid at these put some of the paste into the onions back in some garlic some of the carrots and we're gonna let this go it's gonna be just like vegetarian cool I feel very fortunate right now to actually have a balcony this is my new apartment so we are barely moved in but it's so nice just be outside ah I miss this I wanna like hang out with my friends outside ah it's so nice out today too I think like nice days make it even harder to kind of live indoors because you're just like wow let's go to the park you're like let's like go meet up with friends for a roof at a rooftop bar you know and you can't do that so you just kind of have to make your own rooftop bar which actually I think I should do here let me show you my view for now so this is my view right here and you can see that there's still like a good amount of traffic oh look at it it's so great so normally this would be like a lot of traffic and you can see the road on one side has barely any cars it's coming along and we still need to make the pasta though hey the food is ready it's a kamon I made some goulash that I got a recipe from Sarah's mom so thanks Sarah's mom and these are egg noodles and then you're gonna put some of this in there yeah so instead of beef I used just like mushrooms and you just cut carrots in there put some paprika I use smoked paprika because it'll like a little bit of more of a dimension it's nice and thick the flavor is really nice so the great thing about Louie is that he loves cooking and I hate cooking so he will cook everything and then I will clean up everything so I'm just gonna eat this goulash and then probably answer some more emails mmm this is really good Louie thanks for those of you that like cooking me and Louie made some Guatemalan cooking videos like years ago before I even like did YouTube for real so I'll link those below if you want to try some Guatemalan recipes it's a good opportunity okay one of the things that's really important about quarantine that you need to do is work out or just move because it's such a small space it's really important to like get around and move because you can't go outside like you normally would so I am in my workout clothes and I'm redoing one of my favorite workout YouTube channels her channel is called Pamela Reef and like all of her literally first off she literally looks perfect which I'm like how do you look this good I mean I guess that's why you have to workout channel right and I I love all of her workouts I'm gonna be trying the playlist workout which it's like a thing that I've seen a lot of people doing lately they kind of do a workout to a song so you kind of dance with it so this one's edge here in south of the burp south-of-the-border leg workout no equipment needed all right let's try it it's an actually kind of fun because you like kind of just focus on the song and not the workout oh my god I literally like I'm so out of shape I sense that I may look skinny but that doesn't mean you're in shape look she's 9 she's crazy she doesn't even I swear thanks to my favorite roba I love her channel she has really like good workouts for short periods of time as someone who was advanced gymnast how I don't know if I told you that I was an advanced gymnast growing up so her workouts are really good it's similar to some of the things I used to do when I did do gymnastics so I do recommend checking out her channel okay I want to finish this workout feeling alright I am out of the shower nice and clean - feeling good after working out now it's time to do my like skincare routine I know everyone's always like oh look at that influence you're doing a skincare routine yep that's what it's come down to so this is by sao paulo g and it's a creamy scrub so it's really good for your skin it's completely natural and I love supporting local businesses so this one's really important to me so what I have here is an unlabeled bottle so this is actually arrogant oil from Morocco it's so good for your skin it's naturally moisturizing and it just feels so nice going on and the next thing is only one sleeping is the course Hydra biome looks like this this is a sleep mask I think it is time to have a nice salad after working out so I'm gonna be making a Greek salad and then probably watch a movie I have a whole list of movies that I'm gonna catch up on and then maybe call it a night so let us continue the day I just made this Greek salad real quick and now I'm just gonna like kind of shake it up but I really love Greek salad when I went to Greece in 2010 it was when I had my first Greek salad ever delicious mm-hmm I wanted to watch Tomb Raider but it cost eight dollars to rent that I was really surprised that's pretty expensive I thought comedy is definitely looking in the comedy section because hey your girl needs to laugh this is depressing oh man Freaky Friday forgot about that that was like when I was in high school maybe I'll just watch like an old classic Disney movie oh man pirates the Caribbean that's one of my favorite movies so good I'm gonna watch avatar because avatar takes place in a different world there's nothing like this world we're living in right now also it's 2 hours and 41 minutes and I have plenty of time to watch the hip is now 1018 so I'm gonna say sign off at this what is your day like I'm curious is it anything like my day um I hope everyone's hanging in there you know this will not last forever it is temporary it gives us a lot of time to reflect improve ourselves and innovate let's keep it positive if you liked this quarantine vlog let me know and I could do another one hopefully not that many though cuz hopefully the will be so long alright thanks for watching subscribe and I
