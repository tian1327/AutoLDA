 good morning everyone it is Friday March 27th 2020 and I'm coming to you with a few updates about what has been going on in the past few days so if you watch my first week vlog then you know that the first few days I still kept going out and picking up a few dog walks here and there if you don't know I am a dog walker that is my full-time profession I have since ceased that completely every time I check my app this is what I get I no longer go out I did go out last Friday to go to the park just for my artist date for the artists way and I don't even do that anymore now the only time I leave the house is to either go out and do some yard work in the backyard or the only time I leave the yard is to go to the grocery store for more food I just found out this morning that my roommate is feeling a little under the weather she's older I'm not sure exactly how old she is but she's in her 60s or 70s and she said this happens to her frequently show starts to just feel a little under the weather and sometimes it develops into a sickness and sometimes it just goes away she's wearing a mask she is limiting the times that she comes out of her room to go downstairs won't lie kind of has me a little worried I have to change my battery because of course it wants to die right now BRB I have made a list of all the things and I would like to discuss as of Wednesday night March 25th the death toll in the US had reached over 1,000 and worldwide it had surpassed 21,000 I'm not sure exactly what the death toll is worldwide now but I did see a statistic that said now the death toll in the US as of this morning was over 1,200 I have several friends of mine or people that I know or I'm friends with on Facebook that are medical personnel most of them are nurses and it's all the same story for all of them most of them are in my home state of Florida but they're also elsewhere and everybody has the same story they were not prepared for this they don't have enough ventilators most of them don't have PPE which I believe stands for personal protective equipment and there are stories that are circulating of having to wear the same mask all day like they literally have to like put it in a bag and put their name on it like these these masks are only supposed to be one time use masks and not only are they have them to wear them all day but they're having to fluctuate back and forth between people who are infected with the virus and people who are not infected with it so obviously that's cross contamination there was a story out of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City where the nurses and doctors are having to wear trash bags literally like black trash bags as protection and one of the nurses contracted the corona virus and has since passed away and it just came out in a statement today I think they were like hospitals and you know medical personnel are pleading with the US government to you know send equipment send money send relief you know and there was a story out the other day about how Donald Trump had told the governors of every state they were on like this conference call I guess he had told them that they needed to provide equipment for themselves so they some of them reached out and tried to do that to these medical suppliers and I believe the governor I won't even quote which state is from because I'm not really sure that on a separate conference call said hey you told us that we were on our own for you know providing our state with these supplies well we contacted these medical providers to you know to get this equipment that we need and we were told that we were denied because we were outbid by the federal government so Trump is telling all of these state governors that they're on their own but then he's going behind their back and out bidding them and and providing more money to these medical suppliers whom of course because healthcare is a for-profit industry in this country are going to you know go with whomever is the highest bidder and then it just came out this morning that Donald Trump said I really don't believe that you need all of these ventilators like what first of all why in the hell are medical staff going to lie number two he's the President of the United States like I'm an average citizen I I'm paying attention I know how many stories there are from medical personnel that are saying we don't have enough of anything you know we don't have enough equipment we don't have enough protective gear we don't have we don't have enough people are dying literally it's the same thing that happened in in in Italy they didn't have enough ventilators and they were have to having to make these like life-altering choices about who they let live and who they let die it was second of all like why are these ventilators and why are these things so expensive because it sure as hell doesn't cost that much to make these things as we saw there was a valve that was literally like I don't know if it was for the ventilators or exactly what it was for but there is this particular valve that they didn't have enough of in Italy and they it was a $11,000 for this tiny little valve and these people came in and they they were like we need like a mass amount of these produced you know and so these two two guys stepped up and there are 3d printers and I think within 24 hours I forget how many they were able to make but literally they made the exact same valve and the company that makes them refused to give them the the blueprints of how to make them so they had to basically take this valve apart and make three different variations of the valve to see which one would fit and thankfully there was one one of the three of them did fit and so they they were able to to 3d print them and for how much you say $1 just about the equivalent of $1 and these medical companies are charging $11,000 for this valve and then on top of that the medical company was then threatening to sue these guys for creating this like it's just so mind it's so like I can't I just can't wrap my head around the fact that there are people in this country and this world that are so in love with money that they're okay with letting people die how do you argue with that how do you debate that how do you talk any sense into somebody or come to any sort of compromise with someone that doesn't care if you die I'm not sure if I mentioned it before but there was a thing was the governor or someone that held a position in office in Texas that said that grandparents should be okay with dying for the economy and within the last few days we've had several billionaires billionaires like as if they already don't have enough money billionaires talking about how the lease Vollmer abow amongst us need to start go back to work within the next few weeks the US has since surpassed Italy and China for the most confirmed cases of the coronavirus that brings me to the stimulus package that I've been talking about recently the Senate has finally passed a stimulus package they say it's two trillion dollars first it turns out that it might not only be two trillion dollars one person is saying that it's looking like it's more like four trillion and another person is saying that it's actually when all is said and done it's more like a ten trillion dollar bailout package you know what we get it looks like I haven't and I haven't seen the text exactly but what I am seeing is that anyone who made $75,000 or less I think it's in there 2018 year it gets a $1,200 check what the hell is $1,200 going to do for us that that's a one-time check other countries are giving their their city like $2,000 per month until this thing is over and instead Wall Street got bailed out and major corporations got a huge  bailout as well once again the poor and working-class families will suffer the most Alexandria Acacio Cortez tweeted the only people who are getting this bailout money are people with a Social Security number not immigrants that are legally allowed to work in this country I think it's a ten number or something like that that they said these people are literally coming over here they have the legal right to work they pay taxes and they're not they're not gonna see anything there's any silver lining to this people like Boris Johnson have tested positive for the corona virus several other heads of state have also tested positive and they all keep meeting with each other they all keep telling us about how we're supposed to social distance and stay away from people but they keep having meeting after meeting after meeting and they're shaking hands Cuba is stepping up they have helped Italy China Jamaica and they are in Belize as well I believe they're also in Grenada there's at least one or two other countries that they're there in as well helping doctors with the the corona virus and they Cuba it's not a cure but the medicine that Cuba has is it helps boost the immune system so the people who have been dying from the corona virus are people whose immune system is not 100% so they're immuno compromised for you know pre-existing conditions this medicine that Cuba has I will I will put the the name of it right here because I don't remember exactly it's alpha something alpha two beers I don't know I'll put it right here uh-huh but yeah that it helps boost people's immune systems so it allows their immune system to fight off the virus the lease has police is like my second home beliefs has confirmed at least one case maybe - now of people with that have tested positive those are the updates that I have for now I will keep an eye out and ear out everything and I will continue to update as much as possible I said that today I was going to start filming everything and I forgot so yeah starting now I'm going to film Oh as much as possible that way I get at just of what it was that I was doing even if it's mundane even if it's like repetitive because I've been doing a lot of the same things over and over again to try to get these projects done yeah just you know sorry if it's boring but like like I said in my first video this is for posterity for myself so I can look back on other people can look back on yeah so I right cue the montage  good morning it's another day it is Saturday March 28 2020 day 15 of quarantine for me that's insane I swear on everything it feels like it's been like three to four days it's been over two weeks that's crazy and it's it's gonna last a lot longer than that delicious breakfast one sliced apple with peanut butter and granola when there's food he's never too far away you know you boy good boy you know the update on the that's going on trump has allowed the epa to basically get rid of all regulations right now from everyone being inside the pollution levels in every city have like dropped dramatically there's no smog in Los Angeles and now this gives freaking corporations that already didn't give a  about us carte blanche to just do whatever the hell they want they can literally dump sewage in the rivers and our water sources they're actually supposed to keep track of their violations so they can report their violations but they won't be punished for them what Trump has said he he actually said that if your city is want ventilators then your governors have to be nice to me it's a two-way street so basically people are dying in New York right now that don't have to die because Trump is mad that Governor Cuomo has been mean to him and I tried to file for unemployment yesterday in Seattle and the the application is just absolutely ridiculous they like the things that they ask it's so confusing first of all one of the first questions they asked is well like how much money I made during these separate quarters so this this first quarter which was from like October 31st to December of 2018 I wasn't really I wasn't really employed I can't even remember what I was doing honestly so I put like a lesser amount but then in December of 2018 is when I got hired for the company that I work for and so I put a higher amount for for that time and then an another separate question was like did you work less than 17 during this period and I swear to you it's at October 2018 to December 2018 so I put yes because I was like not really you know employed somehow I don't know if it if it said like if it if it gave the whole last like year and a half for that period or what I I'm not even sure what I marked but like when I hit submit I like immediately received an email saying that I was ineligible because I hadn't worked the required 680 hours the last year and a half which is absolute  because yes I have worked that much and I worked way more than that I found out how much our checks our stimulus checks are going to be it is a one-time payment of $1,200 cruise ships got like a five hundred billion dollar bailout like and they're still operating if you're not supposed to have any gatherings in most places it's like 50 or more some places it's 500 or more some places it's only 10 or more but you're still operating cruise ships right now I don't know if it's if it's if it's like docked yet but I saw several articles about how a cruise ship was approaching Florida with four confirmed people dead on the ship and like a hundred were in quarantine because of their sickness I guarantee you people are still not going to want to like rise up people are still not going to be mad enough I don't know if there's ever going to be a situation where something happens that people are just so fed up because in my opinion this would be it the way that this US government this administration has handled this pandemic this is it this is the time that people are supposed to be angry and supposed to say no no more but so many people just want to get back to their lives as normal and it's just it can't happen it can't happen Jeff besos the owner of Amazon started this contribution fund for his employees put in twenty five million dollars and then claimed that it was because of the the nature of the fund it was eligible for people to make contributions to it so they Amazon said that people can make contributions to Amazon workers if they want Jeff Bezos is literally the richest man in the world I'll try to find a figure and put it up here about how much he's worth so you're gonna tell me a man that has hoarded that much money can't give some of it to his employees I don't know why I was sent here into this world at this time but it's incredibly frustrating as a level of people's stupidity is just beyond mind-blowing anyway so I'm gonna get to work because I don't know I just gotta keep my mind off of this for a little while because this is this is insanity  good morning everyone there's not a whole lot to update you on everything is still a circus and I really have to like limit how much I'm on Facebook or social media that can be very overwhelming and even for someone like me whom is like wants to keep up to date I can feel it weighing on me sometimes if I consume too much of the information it's bad enough that you know we have our president and several billionaires billionaires already wanting us to go back to work because they're losing money oh my goodness  I'm starting to lose track actually about a week ago I started to lose track of what day it was today is Sunday March 29th 2020 and I just had a shower for the first time since Thursday we really like I haven't left my yard well I haven't left I haven't even gone outside since Friday no since Thursday Thursday yes it's Thursday I haven't left the yard I can't even remember because I told you did the photos from my phone or I mean the videos are my phone the last time that I went to the grocery store because I had already put it in the vlog and now I can't remember what was the last day that I went to the store so I don't even remember it's been over at least a week maybe longer to be honest with you I am such an introvert and this is just like real life for me anyways the only thing that's different is that normally I would leave the house from like ten to five or ten to six you know and be gone doing dog walks for the majority of the day before I came back and did this exact same thing that I'm now doing all day and I haven't been bored yet because I have so many projects to catch up on but and then I'm trying to like watch movies and do social media I smoked a little bit and just have like some relaxation sessions and I need to meditate more I really do I did that for one day and it was an amazing day and so much great stuff it's come out of that that if I can do that on a daily basis then I can only imagine how amazing everything would be well given the circumstances didn't film breakfast this morning I've been telling myself that it would be vlogging everything but I'm just not used to it so it's just not happening I don't even care how mundane it is I just literally like forgetting to pick up the the camera and I've switched to my canon g7x mark 2 because taking video on my phone for whatever reason now that my the Adobe Premiere has updated it doesn't accept my like the videos from my phone are considered like QuickTime videos movs and yeah it won't it won't transfer them I have to I found a software that I downloaded that I can convert them.i I'm not able to like batch convert them so I have to convert them one by one by one and that is exhausting and it takes up a lot of time so it's easier even though this is heavier this is easier for me in the long run and saves a lot more time to use this and the quality is better so but you know for those quick things that if I forget to take this out with me if I go to the store or something and my phone would be sufficient that is the update for now I will keep you updated if anything drastic happens   being as I haven't been walking in like two weeks and since I'm used to walking six days a week upwards of like twelve miles some days my body is becoming extremely tense and I had the last two nights I've actually had problems sleeping because I I just can't get comfortable due to my lower back being in so much pain I just did some stretches finally I've been wanting to do them for a while now and I want to do some exercises as well but I am on the second floor I think kind of like the Attic basically so there's a room right below me and there's a room right next to me yeah I can't really do jumping jacks and stuff I got here on the second floor cuz it was just beat it would be a nightmare definitely got to get some type of exercise and I wanted to do a walk today but I didn't get around to it and honestly like I've just been inside so much like I'm I know I'm gonna have to like talk myself into actually going outside because once I get into this into this like feeling of being comfortable here I just I have no desire to leave I will talk to you all in several hours whenever I wake up alright I am going to do some meditation maybe read a little bit and take my ass to sleep alright mmm good morning everyone it is Monday March 30th I have and in quarantine now for two weeks it's like 11:30 about right now and yeah I had breakfast earlier and I'm just writing my morning pages I've actually been writing my morning pages now for like an hour and a half I keep getting distracted but yeah I am it's the same thing today you know breakfast morning pages what do we have what else we have on the list all right so we've got finished the morning pages that I need to pay my bills for the month of April my parents were shout out to my parents seriously like if it wasn't for them and my privilege like I I would be stressing a lot more right now than I actually am they helped me out with some money so I'm able to pay my bills and I don't have to you know worry about it do the artists away I want to read a little bit oh I want to come up with some new recipes so today is my goal to scroll through Instagram and find some nice vegan and vegetarian options of things that I've never either never had or never cooked before cooking is one of the only ways that I'm able to be creative right now so yeah oh I need to stretch when I'm done with this I stretched last night right before I went to sleep and it really really helped me out so yeah I want to start stretching in the morning and stretching at night before I go to bed I do also want to do some yoga as well I found somebody recommended this person who was doing these yoga stretches on Instagram so she's got like different days for different parts of your body I think yoga and stretching and meditation are both or we're all really important right now as we you know stay inside to help us keep us saying help help keep our bodies healthy nothing too crazy has happened except for I did just read an article about how there's like a portion of the two trillion dollar stimulus bill that gives wealthy real estate agents a tax break for the next three years so go figure I think more and more as you know people read through what what the bill says that they're going to come out with a lot more articles about all the  that is in their book this country    well that was an interesting last few hours yeah I started getting into that book the journey of awakening and I hit my weed pen a couple of times and I had some my notebook open so I could make some notes and yeah within just a few pages I went to like this different level and realized a bunch of things that are like kind of blowing my mind which is like I'm not surprised I'm not you know shocked or anything like that but this is like all pertaining to me personally and then afterwards I had a high like an hour nap and it's just like I stayed in the exact same position I didn't move I had the covers over my head and I was just like I don't know and this like state of bliss the entire time and I was like super conscious I don't think I was as conscious like as I can be but I was more conscious than I usually am certain things were coming at me and then my brain was just like answering them like no this is this no this is that I don't know I know it's very vague and it sounds like what is it no I'm not I'm not still high but I am I very much believe in the healing powers and medicinal powers of marijuana and I would be an advocate till the day I die    hello everyone I am coming to you from the future and I'm in the midst of editing this video and I talked for hella long holy crap I didn't think I had any footage which I didn't really I just I didn't have a lot of footage of me doing anything I was just talking a lot but I feel like it's important information that pertains to the situation going on so I wanted to leave it in but also I didn't want to make a 15 minute long video because I know y'all don't even stay for the full 30 minute ones let alone a 50 minute one so I'm breaking this up into two parts this is the end of the first one and I will bring you the second one in just a few days fingers crossed it's mostly edited just gonna add some music all right thing loves I will see you all at the end of April and I know I know I know you see me I live in this thing this thing is like attached to me leave me alone I'm looking at my best life I wha  you
