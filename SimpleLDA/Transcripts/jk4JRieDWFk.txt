  don't chew that please only have one you can't show up my stuff I can't go get replacements it is March 30th I have gone after today it'll be 10 whole days not going anywhere the last place I went was on March 20th I went to the grocery store and I've been able to sustain myself through order to take out and having kind of stocked up on some food here we are crazy I am gonna have to go to the grocery store tomorrow though I don't know about you guys but I feel like these days staying at home or flying by and it's kind of terrifying maybe it's the opposite for you maybe it like that it feels like there's so sluggishly slow but I swear for me I wake up I work on my computer for a little bit and suddenly it's like three o'clock and I'm like what the heck the day is like over halfway over it's really weird it feels like just yesterday that I went to the grocery store to stock up on my stuff but that was actually nine days ago so I have been in quarantine staying home for nine whole days I want you guys to comment below I want to know how long you guys have I know some people have longer some people have four less that's okay I want to know how long have you guys been staying home I feel like obviously it's an important message to just be like oh silly that I wanted to talk about today it was when was that moment for you that you realized how like important this was and that it was gonna affect your life because I think that's something that kind of helps I don't know I've heard like some other people talk about like when they started staying home and as they were talking about that I think that really helped me realize for myself so important it was to stay home so I kind of wanted to go over the timeline for me of like how I've gone through this and gotten into this everything like that and maybe you can relate to it or something first off I made this really dramatic edit and I don't like it anymore because I don't like how dramatic it is but I kind of want to show you guys it cuz it took me hours to do but now I'm like it's way too dramatic but it kind of does okay so this goes over like my overall feelings about everything that has happened from the beginning of January when this like all started for us in the US but no one really knew it up until now here in you know the end of March at some point in the last month we've all had to come to the realization that our lives as we know it would be coming to a halt and things are not going to be normal for quite some time  let's rewind to mid-january when the first us case of the virus was detected here in Washington State personally I was at IKEA didn't think much of it I saw the headline and wasn't super surprised since the ATO is a hub for traveling to Asia February was a great month for me I turned 25 my nephew was born and we all proceeded with life as normal the word pandemic wasn't even in my vocabulary and then on those last days of February the virus was detected in a nursing home in Kirkland but I still thought to myself maybe this whole thing will just go away in Washington state they are confirming now the first u.s. death from covin 19 the disease now deadly in the u.s. the beginning of March I went to Los Angeles and it wasn't until about March 13th on my way back that things began to feel serious to me I got back from LA on March 13th I was there helping Shelby some live video during the duration of me being there everything felt pretty normal people are still going there if there's just kind of like some buzz about but it was pretty normal but by the end of that trip by the day I was leaving March 13th I actually had a flight to go to New York I was gonna go to New York have some fun there but some rumors were starting to fly around it was weird it felt like it was really starting to hate like hey you should stay home so I had to make a kind of tough decision of deciding to just go back to Seattle so I bought a flight to Seattle and actually the flight that I bought to Seattle left at the exact same time that my flight to New York was leaving and of all things going out of LAX or there's probably what like 80 gates at least there's a ton of dates my two flights were right next to each other they're like the two gates right nights to each other right there have a ticket for that flight but I will be going on this one instead and so the whole time it was like taunting me and I was honestly the whole time considering oh just call in the New York flight should I just go on the Seattle play but should I do but I did check a bag and I checked it to Seattle so I would Seattle and I was you know the right thing to do because now we're here in New York is crazy but once I got home that's what I was like okay I need to stay at home now like we're not going anywhere for a while and I don't want to think about how long this is gonna last really but it's not gonna be just two weeks it's not just gonna be a month it is gonna be a while so finding purpose and positivity in your days is gonna be really important and I don't know like try and vlog more and share with you what I'm gonna try and do delay make my days feel worthwhile and not like this time of our lives as a total complete waste so I got back on the 13th but I didn't actually get myself to completely like be fully quarantined until the 20th and it's because I feel like it's really hard to do and there was like a little bit of a learning curve there for me I don't know about you but before all this I would go to the grocery store like every single day there just always be something I was missing I was horrible at grocery shopping for a whole week's worth of food for me I'd never even bought like frozen fish or chicken or anything that stays for longer before and so you know I went to the store okay I'm about to go to the grocery store for hopefully the last time there is just like the craziest rumors going about that like everyone is gonna have to stay in their home and I did here I went to Whole Foods the other day and the worker said that it's gonna get to the point soon where they're only gonna let like a certain amount of people in the store at a time and otherwise there will be a line outside well I guess I spoke too soon I'm right outside of Whole Foods there is already a light outside the door I don't know what's going on other people are waiting outside I thought I stocked up enough and then I realized like two days later I was like I need to go back to the store and then there are still like the temptation to go see things a little bit and so I went to Pike Place Market check that out we're now in downtown Seattle and I'm just going to drive around a little bit look at that they have a takeout only fine check it out this is actually what I love about Seattle downtown here you can see when you look down the streets you can see water it's so beautiful so think we're just gonna head on over to Pike Place Market and see what's going on there I'm pretty sure they had to close as well here we're coming up on Pike Place look at elevation cute actually had one of those growing up a Dalmatian okay like I mean it's still open restaurant is called see town and it's owned by Tom Douglas who is a really famous restaurant owner here in Seattle and it's closed you can see that completely covered the doors so you can see here the market is actually totally open and to be honest it seems kind of more sanitary to be here than in some grocery store where everyone screwed up there's like a lot less people here you can still get some fresh fish here I never thought I'd be able to say I could sit down at Pike Place Market have the whole thing to myself so that day I did what I thought was the best thing to do which will be supporting local vendors I was trying to be optimistic and making the most out of this and trying to turn a bad thing beautiful but to be completely honest with you guys this day kind of haunts me a little bit because looking back now I don't think it was the right thing to do and if you see the reality of this clip right here ever was still getting too close to each other and if I could take it back I would but I can't it's in the past now it was over 15 days ago but I just want to admit that I feel like it was wrong of me to like go to Pike Place Market that day but I realized you know like oh everyone has that mentality though like everyone thinks no one's gonna be there therefore there are people there and there are too many people there and so I kind of went out and about a little bit and I obviously shot that video of Seattle and I tried to keep my distance and stuff but then after that now I've gone full-on shelter mode and the highlight of this week was actually so Canlis which is a fine dining restaurant in Seattle they opened a drive-through which was a really cool way to solve this problem for them of having to shut down their restaurant and how are they gonna pay their like 95 employees and it was really fun because candless is usually this really fancy restaurant it was so cool to see them open up a drive-through where you get a burger for $14 if you guys can get a better look at the line and this is actually the restaurant up here it's really it looks like a millionaire's beautiful Pacific Northwest mansion that overlooks the city cities over there lakes over there they actually just posted on social media that they're about to sell out so if you're not already in line don't come over here and we're like technically weird line but I don't know if we're in like that maybe they only came out in line like being like at the restaurant so we might have just waited in this line for no reason but we will come back tomorrow then like guy came up to like the cars and was like deciding like sorry like we're done and we thought for sure here we go sorry we're done for the day which is totally fairly if we wouldn't have been mad like it's fair and say come back tomorrow oh my god it's so good it's really cute it comes in you know brown paper bag just like a drive-in would be and so here are their salads the fries the crunches their apologies for this not looking super photogenic cuz we warmed it up a little bit but this is the burger it's really cute this is the veggie melt it looks so good and the french fries are very tasty here try one pretty good fry that was really fun there's definitely the feeling of like people trying to come together and all that but since then they actually have shot the drive-thru down but I think it was open for like two ish weeks no so that's a little update I know we're all like super sick of hearing obviously about the virus all this stuff but like I just I feel like every creator has a right to feel the need to talk about it and get it out of their system because it's not natural to just like go on with your business and pretend like everything's fine and everything's happening but and everything's normal when it's totally not so I just had to like give my two cents there as well that's it I'm gonna try and vlog more because I feel like it's gonna be something that helps me feel like I have more purpose to my days and I hope it's something that like you guys could look forward to as well it's gonna be a reach like think of stuff to film it's gonna be a real reach thank you guys for watching stay safe everyone have a good day I'll see you tomorrow bye
