 it's working okay hello my name is Natalie I live in New York City it is April 6th 2020 um I'm basically filming this intro because yesterday my roommate Claire and I filmed some clips on our walk around New York City and in our apartment sort of just talking to each other about what this quarantine and period of time has been like for us not that I think it's different for us than from anyone else I just know a lot of friends and family have been reaching out really worried about us being in New York City verse other places I guess and I'm from California Claire's from the DC area most of our friends in the city who are mid 20s have left the city and got into their parents houses or friends houses that are closer than where they're from or you know other homes in the Hamptons and stuff and we stayed I - neither of us really even considered leaving like we live here and that we just planned to stay so yeah I don't know Claire's dad said we should she should keep a diary for for in the future when people you know want to read the diary of someone who was on the front lines for this pandemic um I'm not gonna do that but I guess this is like a video diary I don't know I don't know if anyone does even interested in this and I don't think it's not different from you know my friends who are in San Francisco and Los Angeles and DC and stuff but I guess people are really concerned about New York City and the situation here is probably a lot worse numbers-wise it is a lot worse but it's also one of those things where I think that everyone's social distancing in the stay at home and all that kind of stuff is really hard in a place like New York City where apartments are notoriously tiny you maybe don't have access to the outdoors in like a private area like a patio or a backyard so there are a lot of people who are outdoors for walks and whatnot wearing masks maybe not wearing masks if you can't get them we didn't have them until two or three days ago and my mom sewed some and sent them to us so yeah we just um you know not trying to make this video to say our situation is worse than anyone elses or to say that we're doing everything right necessarily because obviously in a perfect world and as perfect people we wouldn't go outside for walks and I don't know I guess order groceries but even then somebody is having to deliver them for you I don't know I you know this is a really weird situation you're hearing things from all sides from people saying don't go outside at all because you could be a carrier and spreading it and then you also hear you know oh well it's okay to go outside as long as you stay this far away from people but in a place like New York City they haven't closed the streets what they have closed is certain parks and playgrounds obviously not Central Park and stuff but like our neighborhood parks the gate they're locked you can't get in and so when you're walking on the street and the streets are still open to cars and a sidewalk is only so wide that there's sometimes no way to avoid getting close to someone it's like yesterday Claire and I were specifically walking on one side of the street thinking everyone would be walking the same direction and people aren't and there's just I don't think there's a way to control that yeah I don't know I just thought we'd sort of record our thoughts and stuff I'm personally feeling okay today last week it got really scary the alerts coming in you know on my phone I have a local New York news app NBC 4 New York and I get a lot of alerts every day about the number of people infected the number of deaths and it's for like all of the tri-state area so it's it's scary and it was definitely scary really scary last week I didn't leave the house for five or six days even though I needed groceries had things that I sort of needed to do I was just too scared to and really paranoid anytime I even you know I'd leave that my apartment maybe once a day to go check our mail room and then would come back and shower yeah so I don't know I it's just a weird time and as someone who's not working right now it's also weird Claire is working and so we have sort of two different perspectives the person who's like working from home and has like that sort of disruption and then the person who's not working and I'm trying to fill my days with things that are meaningful or you know better my life in some way I'm gonna use this time for positive so personally I've been painting reading and I should be studying my language and stuff but you know it's a lot of pressure to put on yourself in a crazy time but yeah okay that's just the intro I'll put in other clips we filmed 47 minutes yesterday of us just talking to each other about our thoughts and feelings I'm gonna cut that down because a lot of it was just us talking anyway yeah apologies for this we are lucky because our apartment building hasn't closed our laundry room yet but I know a lot of people's have because it's a communal space so I did my laundry I did a lot of laundry my laundry my house gets down there today in case our building closes and so okay play the other clips now so we just finished watching a movie it's like midnight Sunday night we're very tired from our walk today but basically we walk out the weekends and then don't leave the house for like five days I don't know for some reason for me the panic sets in a lot more on the weekdays I don't know about you I don't know but like I I don't know if like there's just more news coming out but that's when I like get all the news alerts and see the numbers of like actual people who have gotten it in New York City and like the death rate and then like they're really bleak like we don't have enough ventilators for like tomorrow and that's when I get like I don't know a lot more paranoid just like in general yeah why it just they're just like really weak company so really but like smokers can recover their lungs after a few years of not smoking yeah but then some don't yeah I don't know I just like on the weekends maybe cuz it was like sunny yesterday and today and I just like was itching to get out of the house you know you're feeling about how do you think you would survive this was before we got any news about the virus like three months ago then yeah okay I don't think no but that was a little different I just think it's funny that you said that not funny but and then yeah Claire was just saying that like if there was another plague I give another plague hit the world like do I think I would survive and I said yeah I thought I would survive and she was like that's like kind of narcissistic because like most people would die and it's like classic of me to think that I'll live but like I don't know I mean yeah I know yeah I still think that once spread more easily I think although apparently this one's spreading I don't know I just like we're trying to eat healthy during this time but we also like I like ran out of groceries this week and was like too scared to go grocery shopping for a few days and then I finally just did it and it's like everyone says you should social distance but it's like impossible here and like certain stores are only letting in people a few people at a time but the grocery store closest to us isn't doing that they're just people are still just like walking in and it's underground and like the aisles are like maybe three feet wide so you cannot social distance and like we didn't have masks until like two days ago because my mom sewed someone mailed them to us I didn't have gloves I was just like basically if I left the house I would shower upon my return wall outside yeah yeah I mean it's like it's weird cuz I mean personally I was not employed at the start of this and I was trying to get employed because I just moved here in January and Claire has been employed not for like that long so we both just moved here in January and so for me I was sort of already on like a self distancing because I'd be home a lot but now that it's like the law basically it's a lot harder so you can't just come and go of your own volition what do you think how's it been working at home yeah right you go from your bedroom to the end of the workday yeah sure are you feeling stir-crazy at all see I don't mean to be like our situation so hard because obviously I think some people have it worse but I do think that the situation here is worse because obviously we have tons of people already but then also all the people in this city are stacked on top of each other and below each other in such like tight quarters that like nobody has a big apartment if you can afford a big apartment you've already left the city and gone to your Hamptons house and so the people who are stuck in their apartments don't have balconies don't have backyards we have small apartments like yeah like just to clarify like most people I know who also live in the city like people our age have gone back home whether that's California or like other states I say California so I'm there but like a lot of people flew back to California which to me was like extreme and also like my parents are in their 60s I'm not like it just didn't make sense for me to go from here where there's tons of cases to my parents house oh he's so cute um and so you know we were like just gonna stick it out here which seemed like the normal thing to do like we pay rent we live here like these fetches but obviously a ton of people here have left like so many people I know I know yeah and that's the other thing like I'm finding like hard to believe obviously I think if I had asked and been like you know really really wanted to go home I think my parents would have either helped me buy a fly or bought me a flyer or something but I mean first of all I would cat so couldn't leave him and like also I wasn't just gonna infect my parents also like this is my hot like I live here I know and I wasn't gonna leave you either I don't know it just it's weird to me that people left but I totally get why they did because like it is weird here like I'm gonna add in the clips I took today of like house bearing the streets were and stuff I literally live here yeah like I was take a six-hour flight to California and then just like indefinitely stay there like it's just like weird especially having just moved here in January for the city to now like we used to be like that anxious State yeah then without it yeah I know it's weird and like our street we live right by x square so obviously like we live in Hell's Kitchen there's people all the time and I think more so here there's like more like older local kind of people whereas like we walk down to like the East Village today which is a lot of people our age you like live yeah clip here um who did leave and you know go to their parents houses or whatever and then also like different neighbor it's not really helping different neighborhoods people have second third homes whatever like to go to so our neighborhood we still honestly it's really sad there's quite a few homeless people who obviously don't have anywhere to go and so there you're still out on the streets and don't have masks or anything not laughing at homeless people I'm laughing at my cat um but you know I think our neighborhood there there are a lot of people out and about still and some people like seem to be you know we have our masks that we carry with us in case we're like in densely populated areas otherwise they're like so like they're not the n95 s or anything it's so hard I mean people don't have supplies here so you feel kind of like a dick like I'm not gonna go out and try and buy like a medical-grade mask and then you know like yesterday went on our walk we passed Mount Sinai and I just felt scary and then today I don't even know where we were but we passed there are these two nurses walking and one of them just turns to the other and goes yeah the morgues are all full and I just like bringing in like refrigerator trucks like trucks that usually drive like deli meat or whatever to like Walmart are being brought into New York City to be temporary morgues so like there's definitely scary stuff but also but then and then you do see the news and stuff but then like at some point you've been cooped up in your apartment for so long that you just have to get out you know the news and you know what's going on and it's scary but like you physically cannot stay in this like 200 square foot I don't even know how big that is that's small right how BIG's our apartment well and then you know you're stuck in like your little apartment and like you just have to get out like our windows don't have screens on them so I can't open my window too far because my cat will get out and like yell on the second floor so like they're just like you can't even get like fresh air well like it when you're in the apartment for like five days in a row you like eventually like earlier this week this is sound so dramatic but like I thought my legs my leg muscles were atrophying I know and it felt so weird like our gyms been closed for a month it was fifteen thousand I literally went just passed out afterwards she did for a while I I had to we didn't bring our wallets with us or any because when we go for these walks we don't we literally don't touch anything from when we leave our buildings when we get back like we don't go in anywhere anything because like we know that there's this like inherent sort of like you shouldn't even be out for walks kind of thing but like that's kind of why I wanted to do this like video diary thing because I think it's so easy to say that when like you have a backyard you're at your parents house you're like you know maybe like even a balcony but like people who are judging or like what you didn't go outside at all okay well I'm glad that you have the ability or privilege to have all of your groceries delivered or order food delivery or you have a gym in your building or something like whatever like the peloton yeah I mean it's just like I don't know Clare's dad suggested she keep a diary because we're in the center of a global pandemic but you know maybe maybe someone will watch this video diary cuz they're curious maybe not I'll definitely share it with my family who keeps like messaging me like have you died in New York City yet so V um but yeah we just wanted to UM you know give people an update basically I've watched a lot of TV we've been trying to play Catan but there's only two of us in the apartment so we downloaded like the app to play with strangers yeah yeah so supporting businesses I guess um yeah it's just like I don't know it's kind of crazy like I don't really want to like necessarily show people our apartment but yeah I mean I've got a puzzle going now basically my mom had to send me a puzzle because I tried to order puzzles online from like four different websites and they were all sold out and couldn't ship for like months so my mom had just send me like the one puzzle that they have my mom sent me two rolls of toilet paper because we didn't stock up on toilet paper because we were like those people are crazy and ruining it for everyone but then they ruined it for us and we didn't have toilet paper and then what else did my mom send us oh she sent us a snack box she sent us Oh a bunch of tea Indian food like prepackaged Indian food um yeah she sent us a lot she's been a saint Oh some decks of cards yeah but I mean yeah I guess it's kind of weird like going on tik-tok and stuff and seeing people like quarantine with their whole family and like I mean yeah I was gonna say like your quarantine with your family and like I'm sure that's its own struggle I don't know cuz the poor people are too crazy to use tik-tok right now cuz they're like blowing each other's brains out it's their houses are smaller going crazy that's how it would be at my parents I was like oh my gosh like especially my dad keeps wanting to leave the house like he'd be so annoying and he's got his little we call it his hidey-hole his like office room that's right next to my bedroom at my parents house so I would I'd be so done anyway at least my parents of a backyard and like yeah your parents have a dog yeah that's the other thing is we've just like been trying to like see people's dogs like from afar like we met Chloe today uh-huh yeah Chloe we going outside for the walks is like sort of what's keeping us sane but it also makes us so paranoid like today like we're walking and you know someone's like excuse me like can you spare some change I just got out of the hospital and instead of like my first instinct being like oh my gosh I was like out of the hospital like don't tell me that which is like so horrible I don't even know if what keeps out in it makes me sounds like such a bad person yeah or every time like I have my mask down here because otherwise it gets too hot and then when we get within like 20 feet of someone I pull it up and that you just feel like a horrible person yeah I know I didn't I don't know why he's like that he just gets like this at night yeah I don't know it's just weird it's just weird I don't even know like I I I just wanted to do this like kind of like update kind of thing because I feel like a lot of the stuff that you're seeing online from people it's like famous or rich people who are like oh like stay inside and it's like okay but you can afford food delivery you can like maybe you have a nice house with a yard and everything so like the stay inside thing obviously you should do that but at the same time like people keep talking about like New Yorkers like need to like stay the home or whatever the hashtag is or whatever and I just think it's important to realize that most people here live in shoeboxes without any real access to the outdoors and so when you see these videos of people who are out walking and maybe there's not six feet between them and someone when they're passing like okay the streets are all still open so you can't walk in the street so you're walking on the sidewalk like everyone else because you're a normal human being who needs fresh air and exercise but I feel like by me walking yeah because we're gonna bring that on by yeah I know I agree well that was like you good you sneeze okay um it was like when like restaurants and like stuff we're still open we're like oh my god we have to go before they close kind of joking not thinking they were actually gonna close and then so what we're doing we're going out and being out and stuff and then they did actually close and now it's like we can walk down ninth Avenue which is usually so busy and maybe one thing will be open and it's Walgreens and they're like letting five people in at a time like it's just so post-apocalyptic and people are just disregarding like all human decency like the amount of  on the sidewalks today on our walk possibly human I'm from San Francisco so like we're used to human  on the sidewalk honestly at this point but not here you people think New York City's gross San Francisco oh all over the sidewalks but like there was so much poo today there was garbage everywhere I know it's Anarchy it is mean the grand scheme of things it's like I know it's also interesting to see the way like a city handles something like this because like essential workers in New York City includes like like the subway and the transit and stuff so the buses are still running and there's drivers I haven't seen a single person on them but like medical workers a lot of them take that to work so they can't just shut it down but obviously that's a huge way to spread it so there have been all these pictures of people like still on the subway at rush hour and stuff and people are like what are you doing so it's hard because a city especially like New York City where people don't have cars or other ways to get around you can't really close things like that there's no way to patrol like who's taking it like my parents can drive to the beach like instead of walking in our neighborhood they drive like a mile to the beach and walk on the beach Trail and there's no one else there and that's you know it's fine but they have a car here you're literally going for walks in your neighborhood because you can't drive anywhere which means you're walking with everyone else from your neighborhood who's also out for a walk especially on the weekends so you know what are you split like there there's not really any way to avoid that today we sort of went to like the business the area we're on Fifth Ave like over by the Empire State Building and you know there weren't very many people out there because nobody really lives there like if I have to get sacrifice you know shape compacity like I don't know I think we it's weird because we think it's a necessity and I feel that way too but in the end it really isn't I know this video diaries literally just gonna be us having like like philosophical like should we not have gone for that I know and that's the thing is like I feel like it's so hard especially in a time like this like this whole video I'm basically saying like okay let's try not to guilt-trip people who like need to go outside because they don't have a lot of space or like access to outdoors like but it's because I feel guilty yeah and it's like okay maybe maybe you should guilt me but at the same time I don't want the people guilty me to be people who are currently like in Southern California or Florida with a pool in their backyard and like eight bedrooms like don't guilt me I want it done I wanted to literally be my neighbor who has the exact same layout as me and it has the exact same schedule and it's like don't leave yeah yeah I don't know I just like oh I just I don't know I just definitely feel like I'm going crazy and like as someone who's like already on meds for being crazy I feel like if those aren't working to make me not feel crazy like what like what must it be like for other people like what I don't know no I guess I don't know I don't know what that was I am on medicine that should make me not feel like this but I do feel like this because I mean cooped up and now like if this doesn't change your opinion about like sentencing and jail like that Eddie wouldn't let me be an English teacher it's not live edit summer that's still here for fabfitfun try five off no I'll probably work oh god I don't know I just we thought people might be interested in like what it feels like to be in New York City right now and basically what it's come down to is we feel one cooped up too guilty for ever leaving the apartment three board for paranoid and constantly wondering if any of our symptoms or any of our daily struggles are symptoms and wondering if we'll be one of the many deaths here because we've run out of ventilators in this city so mostly paranoid and guilty I would say and cooped up and bored those were the four I said okay so I would put I would put anxious back like more towards the top I guess really okay well you have work to do I'm just like painting and watching TV and sleeping till noon okay so what goes towards the top anxious guilty okay paranoid / anxious yeah like today on our walk like we went like 2,000 steps probably and I thought I was getting chest pains that I was really just out of shape earlier today I had probably I feel like I shouldn't include my diarrhea I could end you know okay you just get paranoid about certain things maybe you get a headache or you have intestinal issues and you begin to spiral a bit also I'm worried for my eyes because I haven't looked I haven't used your long-distance muscles yeah I've been outside at night I'm gonna lose all my like nighttime vision I'm honestly scared to go out at night because there's so few people around like usually I feel totally safe in this neighborhood because there's so many people but like there's so few people out and like it's so barren you couldn't even run into a store if something was happening which is like usually my plan to like run into a bar or something cuz you get like swept under the rug like I couldn't just get the plague yeah interesting you might end up on an episode of my favorite murder and they'd like do this whole backstory about the plague and then be like and because there was no one on the streets cuz a quarantine she was unsafe and yeah oh no this is now 32 minutes long I've been doing this for 32 minutes basically last night we had the weirdest like dance-off just to like try and get our muscles working and we literally didn't have enough space in the apartment to like kick our legs I don't mean to complain I'm just trying to like actually show people what it feels like I'm sure other cities feel this way too it's just for some reason I feel like I'm getting so many questions because I live here that like for some reason I guess it gave me like an inflated ego to think people care maybe in a time of pandemic you just need to think people care just that last push for leaving something behind in case you do die Oh like whether or not it's like it at the top of your mind at the front of your mind like like in 127 hours there's any like recording a video thing yeah for it cuts his arm off I never saw it either but I thought but yeah I know what you mean that's definitely like people are just like oh in Breaking Bad when he's like I love you this is if if I'm taken like I'm not trying to make this out to be a struggle because it's really not that different from like my life before because I wasn't working I've just been here painting and doing embroidery and stuff but I just maybe my family just is worried but like I feel like I'm getting so many messages from people like oh my god you're in New York City like are you okay being locked in here yeah not if you get your lexapro prescription TV you guys um no I mean I think it's like interesting it definitely would be hard to be with like a random roommate or like you know even like a boyfriend or girlfriend I think it's definitely like a test but I read I feel like for us like you work during the day you like close your door so it's not that different from like like I like that you're around more cuz I was always around here anyway and when you like went to work I would be like just here alone now I had like come into your room like when you're up like taking a break so I don't mind it no it's just weird I'm just glad we're both like there are some people who just like don't respect like you know personal space or anything like that you know we with the door open I literally left a turd in there yesterday  oh yeah oh yeah yeah I know yeah that's true like I don't think either of us are really like that bothered by that like we like I think we achieve a good mix of like talking to each other but also like goodbye it helps that we can literally talk at this level and hear each other from our beds okay well this is 36 minutes long now I have to edit it but if enough people watch this and like if anyone cares about us we'll make another video so like and comment um if you need to hear more about well what if like another video never came out and somebody googled us and we both had died in this apartment and so we started to eat us because we couldn't feed him that's a thing no I know I think he probably me first cuz he feels more comfortable with yeah we might taste different he'll try maybe one of us would rot faster true I already have a cavity well soon enough I'm gonna have bed sores can you imagine we'd be pretty easy to get through since we have no muscles oh yeah true you've got ass though so one way he'd eat himself he could literally go months without eating even after his third dinner he acts like that okay well this was video diary one what's today be brawl six the sixth yeah already 600 way no cuz it was the fifth it's awesome yeah cuz it's after midnight yeah well most what we like we did start right before no one cares thirty I couldn't even tell you what how many days we've been like technically like I know I know how do they know actually start when I started working from home remember the other day I go is it Tuesday and you were like it's Friday or something it was like well no even yesterday Saturday morning oh yeah I was like oh you know when you get up and you're like just now and I was like yeah I don't know weird I've been like online shopping too much too it's like I can't go outside so certain things that I like normally would just go like look for I'm just ordering instead just like rashly cuz it's also so nice to get a package just like the only thing I look forward to it like you're surviving on at this point it is an actual joy in your eyes I know like the other day I ordered socks from Amazon and I'm so excited for them to come they're supposed to come like tomorrow literally just socks like like the footie socks I just have an issue because I want to order more books but I'm super particular about how they smell how they smell the size the ratio yeah and like and I get a book in the mail thing I've ever said but like and it's not perfect I can't read it so like yeah I pick one off my bookshelf you can feel them see them I'll read Cersei sure yeah absolutely I have like four books going right now and my from the library app oh that's the other thing if you're looking for things to keep you going one HBO made a bunch of write books one is books to HBO made a bunch of their shows like fully free for the month of April you need either the HBO GO or now app for some reason only one of them it like works for the other one it like keeps asking to sign in or if you have roku TV like us it's not one of those apps it's on the roku channel app and beautiful it looks like it's on the Roku app and you can watch like a bunch like the big HBO shows not Game of Thrones I don't think but the rest how do you feel about pages that are like this are they like rough like they're not the same I don't want to give my opinion cuz I don't want to sway people if you think we have different are the same the same okay okay yeah but the way in I'll cut that out yeah okay yeah the rough like oh wait show the top where you can see like the like like see see hear how they're like not even they're not all even it's like that like I mean what about ones that are like goals to 41 minutes though anyway okay so HBO has all their free stuff too if you have a library card you can get the Libi app for like your phone or your iPad or and you can put your heart in and reserve books and read like like it's a Kindle or if you have a New York City public library card you can get it's called like a library or something I don't know go on the the public library the New York Public Library website it'll tell you and they have actually like more options in Libby and like usually not as long as a wait so those are great resources just wait to get a virtual book yeah they have like a number of copies of like the ebooks it's annoying I know I know I I know I agree it's one of them right now I'm waiting six months so you can get a Bible app for free I I did and then I stopped after what if like I got so bored during warranty and I started reading the Bible like for real good okay like for real like make it farther than Eve getting her period
