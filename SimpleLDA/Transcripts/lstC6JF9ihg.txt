  hello there finally decided to go out to me multiple reasons first I basically ran out of food and I need to go get some food second I'm literally going places staying at home it's I spent in home without bleeping three weeks maybe even more I lost tell him to like your way to go but it's the longest I've ever spent inside while leaving the house and it's driving me crazy but before I go in to do something about my face situation I'm gonna trim my beard gonna wash my hair gonna go shower gotta go dress up and then I'm gonna show you something  guys do you remember killaby the guys who sent me my chair the chair that I still use for over here and it is so awesome that I can't stop using it well the same guys sent me this bag of masks 50 masks it's impossible to find them now and now I have 50 so I have enough to share with my family and I have enough to wear one one right now when I'm gonna go out thank you so much killaby guys check them out they have awesome chairs and other computer products they just send it for me for free because they wanted to help everybody who ever worked with them they didn't require any review but I couldn't just not mention them because this is this is amazing alright I'm ready to go out mask check keys check money alright finally ready to go do some shopping let's put this mask on and see how it looks I have never done it before it has instructions on it so let's read these instructions together  Cup the respirator in your hand with the nose piece at your finger lips fingertips position the respirator under your chin with the nose piece up pull the top wrap over your head resting at the top back of your head whose bottom strap over your head and position around the neck below the ear this sounds incredibly complicated this is a mask this is not a freaking alright  let's not mess it up wait what this is Judy Sassoon how do you connect them together nevermind I'm an idiot there were two pieces in each mask all right let's do it carefully I see so there's it's like very hard that's what she said  that seems to be pretty straightforward you can mold the top because the top has like it's it's rigid you can oh my god this is genius I've never worn a mask before now it sounds like my nose is quad but it's not yeah no air escapes around I'm done this is it my first ever mask alright it is time to go out   do I look like scorpion God and he took collar this mask yellow they never look like scorpion alright let's go out baby  it's so bright and beautiful outside and I have an idiot em I put a big comedy      and I think there's way more people outside than I expected like I went out last time I went out three weeks ago that was not a single person around not a single car Ronnie not a single person now it's it looks like it's starting to get alive again  well I guess I'm not going to store so far every single story went to was super packed or had a huge line for a couple of blocks outside so I honestly I don't I'm gonna shop I'm probably gonna shrine a few days to order something in line but this is this is too crazy like so many people shopping for some reason like what's happening it does feel nice to walk around outside though I didn't touch a single thing so I think I'll be fine well I made it home and I ended up going to a few stores but I was honestly shocked by the amount of people standing outside Alliance to get to stores I tried to go to Aldi it's the closest and my favorite shop to be honest and they had a line through the entire blog which was over 50 people standing outside trying to get into the store I decided not to send in the lines that would take hours instead I went to a few smaller shops victim picked up some small groceries I couldn't find any meats unfortunately but those don't have to go to the bigger store I probably gonna try again in a couple days but I'm gonna go wait earlier maybe if some people don't wake up that early and the line is gonna be shorter after well I'm very glad I had my mask because some stores even refused to let people in without masks so that's that worked out really well one of the stories I went to was Dollar Tree and they really I'm surprised for the store that sells items for $1 their customer service is top of the line there was a lady standing outside letting people in as people were getting out and she was giving us some hand sanitizer to use before before he entered the store and she was very nice and people inside were very nice amount of people inside the store was limited so to prevent the spread of infection as much as possible it was the most pleasant shopping experience I had since all of that started is just props to Dollar Tree unfortunately I didn't get everything I wanted to get so I will have to go out a couple of days probably again to try again I I was kind of hoping that I would get full supplies for the next couple of weeks and probably gonna stay home for next couple weeks but unfortunately that didn't happen to be honest there was way more people than I expected to see outside considering this right now is probably one of the worst times to be outside in New York everybody was wearing masks though I think 90% of the people I saw were wearing some kind of mess n95 masks normal surgery masks even like handmade masks from the piece of cloth it's still better than nothing I guess and all the shops are trying doing some measures to prevent disease from spreading social enforcing social distancing and all that stuff so that's also very great I would still not go out if I absolutely didn't have to even though I'm absolutely going crazy staying inside thankfully I have a lot of stuff to do I'm working on my channel a lot making a lot of videos trying to come up with some new content website number one I'm working on the website number two the actual star Sky Club website that is hopefully gonna go live quite soon make me couple because that's a lot of work it's it's a huge website also I'm working on the store that I recently announced in the on my community wall you need to contact manufacturers see if you can set up this whole production and like this Oh takes a lot of work and I'm glad that I have a lot of stuff to do during these times and you guys keep reminding me to wash my hands and stay at home and I am I'm gonna as soon as I get enough food because you don't want me to go too skinny don't worry even months without food won't make you skinny well look at yourself in the mirror you fat piece of I look so a guy wearing a gas mask today like an actual gas mask walking around that was absolutely crazy and the masks that killaby sent me they are just so good they very very high quality the they just stick to your face perfectly like absolutely perfectly that's incredible mask again huge shout out to them beautiful job I wouldn't be able to get his master's almost anywhere right now and they just came through and just send it to you so that's that helps a lot all right guys I'm gonna do my part and I'm gonna advise you to stay home unless there's absolute emergency you are running out of food or you need to go to a hospital or something if you don't have to go somewhere stay at home keep social distancing if you need to go out wash your hands wear the mask use hand sanitizer do your best to prevent you getting a disease and people don't you getting a disease I'm gonna go and work in the video for tomorrow what have you done today let me know in the comments when was the last time you went outside and where did you go what did you do where do you live how I want to know here in New York honestly there's way too much people outside a few weeks ago there was way less people well I didn't go to the store but I did go
