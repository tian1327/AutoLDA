from here and I put in the living room so I had this whole space for you know videos makeup and all of that I still have to like reorganize my drawers clean up of course and you know fix this whole

beans from a breeder Trader Joe's it's a bit early but I still want to get a workout in before I eat dinner because I know myself if I eat I'm not gonna work out after and when I say workout I mean

ready with me video a lot of times I'll just leave this like this for like a week or two and then it just piles and piles and piles up but I told myself because my room is a bit more need and organize and spacious you need to clean up every single time after video clean after this clean after that clean you need to toaster toaster yum I'm also thinking I'm running pretty low on food I think I'm gonna run to the store I have a store that's pretty close by put on gloves I don't know if what I put into mascota like a scarf maybe grab and go literally things for like 20 30 bucks nothing major so I'll take you guys with me so I'm running to this store I did not realize that I had this massive stain here I think it's from the sink but I don't know like I'm carrying I'm saying we'll just do this okay anymore here's where I keep my stock oh but he loves and I also have these yellow ones but that's a little bit a little bit much I think I'll take one of these so it's 54 degrees today and I literally feel like I haven't smashed fresh air and what it seems like weeks and months and days honestly Java is my jam of life I can't live and breathe with this on this okay pretty much described a bunch of snacks I would say some of these snack bombo's the best Harry halva it looks like hair is so cute everything on this chair for the past 15 minutes after I ate my Harry cava yum it's so good yeah I've been watching my Instagram stories I just honestly think I'm hilarious I have to have to give it to myself besides for that I feel like I'm just such a cool weirdo like I'm digging it I love you girl coming from someone who used to hate herself like this is gold this is gold and gold for lunch I'm pretty much having some of these rice chips so it's basically chocolate cup of rice cakes so yummy and then I'm also heating up yesterday's dinner for lunch so I'm just editing my bread to honed a look I always check my teeth let me tell you because there was so many times we okay there were so many times where I had so much crap of my teeth because of my lipstick and I'm like no I mean it happened but I've been traumatized I always checked my teeth this hairiness so yummy yeah okay so it's about 6:30 I've been wearing this car to get around the house cool it's just been really cold I'm in need of a shower I want to wash off my face my hair needs a nice wash it's feeling thicker than I don't know what very very thick and bushy this is my absolute favorite the green cleaning makeup melt-away cleansing balm by pharmacy it's so good   it's shower time soon sated it is 11:05 p.m. I didn't have like a normal dinner tonight I would say the boobs are chilling I'm hungry I want to eat something good you know saying I want to eat snack I want anything solid I took a shower my hair this looks like at the shower I love it but um there's no I feet okay I went to the store today with Ma BP so is 349 a.m. I can't sleep apparently I didn't want to show you guys how peaceful it is outside right now like I'm obsessed with this noise and it's smell still fresh pretty chilly but in love good morning or good afternoon I should say I didn't end up cleaning my table yesterday on the attenti to do for today yes sephora play literally just arrived maybe an hour ago and then I had a bee sitting on my desk for quite some time and I also have the regular tipsy here as well I didn't have a chance unbox this I'm gonna box in the same video it's already 2:40 say I'm getting a little bit of a late start I'm giving myself some breakfast just brush my teeth washed my face and I'm ready to eat I thought that I had more time with these bananas apparently not they are so mushy there's no life in them I'm so sad because I really wanted to make a smoothie but oh well I hate wasting food like this it like hurts my heart but I have to be more aware next time so that here's my son wah pretty perfect avocado right happy about this one I think I'm gonna go ahead and make myself some tea I'm so in the mood whew and here's actually where I keep old my teas to the most part I really like this friend they're really good I mean this also is a really nice friend how freakin tasty to this look so it's basically toasted bread sliced avocado flax seeds a little bit of salt a drop of oil and I put some craisins on top just for some added natural sweetness I never did that but I think it's gonna be a good combo so it is currently 5:22 I feel like my day is pretty much over because I woke up so late I wanted to quickly show you guys that I made peanut a la vodka pretty much just put ketchup and it's how I am seasoning so pretty much just these two tastes pretty good and a little bit of salt I literally feel like this whole vlog of turning into just food but I don't know I'm just having a little bit of an off day I feel a little bit sad and just not feeling like myself so yeah that's the story happens to the best of us right this is my waking up face my eyes usually always always cheer when I wake up it's hard for me to wake up sometimes but anyways we're gonna put ND what we're doing together it's 76 degrees outside today it's so happy about that I'm gonna go on a run I did that on Monday I think it was really nice I worked out last night but like BS vibes cuz I think I want to do dad to run like a mile or two just to get my mind off things this is kind of getting to me a little bit in it it just it's a lot I'm sure it's a lot for you guys too it's like I need to do things that'll just you know keep me going I'm not sure what I'm doing for the weekend if I'm staying in or what but I just found out that TJ Maxx and Marshalls and home goods is gonna be closed for the next two weeks so we gotta come up with different video ideas I really like what I'm wearing let me show you know I'm wearing one of these disney shirts very cute mini also when I run I usually won't wear one of these just so that gets wet more and then once you like finish your I don't see how what this is it's kind of gross but cool at the same time I have these leggings from expressed with stars on them they're okay and then these Nike suck that recently bought from ASOS love and then my fila I need to get any ones though cuz they're they're like they feel weird I just finished my jog I run for about an hour or so a little bit rusty I have to get my game back on but I took off this like wrap and this is pretty much all sweat which looks kind of nasty let me tell you but it's also motivating at the same time you know beauty has just delivered my Ulta package these are the brow Wiz pencils I will say though that this box is so huge for two little skinny pencil I feel like it's a bit wasteful so I think it would be better over there with the envelopes you know they don't have envelopes I don't feel but I think it would be better off that way because like you know nari it's only civil I don't know whether you guys think okay I'm really hungry right now I can't make myself a smoothie my mom is so sweet she sent this over yesterday I love these kind of thing throws and fruits are my jam I'm just in need of some bananas I think I'm gonna run to the store grab that and run back home okay so here's my little haul I need food in my life like 24/7 I love fruit vegetables not as much but fruits are my jam I bought three of these bars they happen to be big in pretty good ingredient and several three of them and I ate one is now outside of the front porch I bought some halva this right here is the coconut vanilla one I bought two things of bananas they're about four or five bananas in each great for smoothies I also have avocados this is almost ripe I think I'm gonna go ahead and eat that tomorrow I love Driscoll's so I got some raspberries these were 399 then I got this huge like tub of strawberries it was only $4.99 which i think is pretty good I love strawberries Matan honestly I was not in the mood of cleaning for the past few days here's what my room currently looks like I have so much time on my hands right now that this is not acceptable so I can't believe I let it sit for like this so I'm probably gonna clean up my room organize clean that section there my beauty moon was a bit messy as well so I have to clean that this water tastes amazing I really like it anyways I think that's pretty much it I'm gonna end the vlog
