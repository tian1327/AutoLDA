  it is wednesday may 27th and i wanted to do a day in my like quarantine like what do i do during my day so i decided why not start now even though you guys are not gonna really see much but you know what's the harm in starting from now so yeah it's it is so sorry it is now 10 34 at night i just like legit i feel like every video every video i changed my intro and honestly i don't care because i'm always finding new ways to make it better and i feel like i should show you guys i mean it's gonna be on this video anyways so but i'm gonna i'm gonna show you guys just to see like if you like what i did i can show you how i did it for like people that's coming up and like don't know how to do this or like you try to pay somebody to do for you you could do a cute little intro for now you know until like you get bigger later on and i find this very cute i'm gonna only do this for like things like if i'm doing vlogs or like lifestyle stuff like if i'm gonna get tips and stuff like that and i'm gonna change it for like if i'm doing like fashion hauls or like a look at my closet or like stuff like that all those videos are coming up i've bought a lot of clothes which are not here yet due to quarantine so i'm waiting on them and then there will be more content but for right now i'm going with what i have but this is what i have so far all right so you guys i kind of woke up late well not really but um didn't really get to show you guys how i tutor i mean either way i don't think i was i don't think i would be able to show y'all how i actually tutor only because my students call me on my phone which i also use as my camera i know right but yeah so my students call me on my phone and i would help them on my computer i will show you guys like how i set up and stuff um yeah so they called me on my phone and i would either whatsapp or facetime them and then we'll work on the computer and basically like oh my god what is that oh my god what is that um checklist like the things that we did for how long and i explained it to my supervisors and stuff and i will go through and work with them like on this website that the teachers that the school is having them work on and we work on every different um subject so it could be math art english social studies gym like for gym they do activities or sometimes they would give them like a research about like football players or like all of those stuff so i would help them out on the stuff that the teachers give them on that day so like for instance today is the 28th so every teacher for every subject why my hands are up i don't know every teacher for every subject would either put up like for they have a schedule so let's say today's thursday so he has my first student had math social studies art right those three so because art was a little bit harder because he had to draw a couple of stuff so we did the other three things and then after that they kind of have a meet in with their teacher at 12 until whatever time and then i go back and tutor my other student at another time like an hour after that so i have another student at one and then hopefully i finish around three and then i have one more student so because of memorial day i had a break for three days so like all the counselors had a break for three days because since quarantine started i have not had a break like whatsoever i've been working monday through friday just tutoring kids tutoring tutoring twitter and you would have thought i was a teacher but i'm not well whatever so yeah so we had three days off monday through wednesday and now thursday and friday i had to catch back up with all my students so my hours still equal so normally i would do three students a day but today i'm going to do four four for thursday and four for friday and then together all my hours with that plus i have a meeting with my supervisor and the rest of the other counselors so with all of that we would um all my hours for that would kind of like equal up hopefully you know yeah now i have a little break because it's 12 16 and all the students are like having meeting with their teachers so during this time i would do the checklist that i was telling you guys because i don't do it while i'm working with them i would finish the checklist for the student i was just tutoring and then i would either eat or something but since i already ate and i kind of got myself up to speed so i got a little inside of me or whatever so anyways now i'm i now what the hell am i talking about in it speak speak oh that's lit hopefully i don't move so it don't fall okay so now i am going to go on my other this company that i work with um my coach um her name is nieks um her instagram i think is body she has two so one is body by nyx so basically what exactly we do is um we work for tlc not weed listen to me i'm tired of explaining to people tlc is not weed tlc is like a program or not even a program a company that basically sells natural things to help you get fit i that's that's how i would put it but basically what they do is um they sell cream pills uh what else vitamins like liquid vitamins just anything that would help you like either boost your immune system help you sleep at night stop you from craving like you know when you eat too much during the day they have stuff for that um so they have stuff like that so i teamed up with mike before i teamed up with my coach um this was before it even got popular because i since before i think since quarantine started everybody's doing it but like before this happened my mother and i we decided to try it out so i got the tea i'm gonna show you guys what it looks like the tea so this is not the one that i had but we had the um the original one which is like i think the lemon one so this is how we look i know what you're saying um it worked hit me out hit me up let me tell you how see i'm 20 you know my mom was like what am i trying to lose like what are you what are you trying to lose what are you trying to lose so basically everybody you know they have unnecessary okay see it full um see great so let's get back to this all right so everybody has weight that they're trying to lose either is from their neck area or their stomach or just their thighs themselves like just because your thighs you got thunder dogs whatever i know i had unnecessary weight that i was trying to get rid of i tried everything in the book i don't care what nobody said i tried everything in the book i tried the the vix the vicks rub with the ceramic wrap it works but it doesn't hold you know what i'm saying like if you do it for three days it's not your stomach's not gonna stay that way like you first of all rub your stomach today and tomorrow you eat the same way since the fat is going back you have to legit i didn't want to like i feel like that's one of the things i never wanted to try was to change my diet only because since i like to eat i like to eat now you're telling me that i can't eat the way how i'm eating i don't want to do that you know what i'm saying but it don't make sense like you can't rub your stomach for three nights and think your belly not gonna come back if you're still eating the way that you're eating you know what i'm saying so i've tried that i've tried um the apple cider vinegar it helps that's again it helps but if you're still eating the same way since the weight is gonna come back regardless so this is why i tried the tea because you can drink it hot and you can drink it cold and it's not necessarily like just targeting just the the areas that you want to lose weight in it's taken out toxic out of your body so that steak that you had a month ago it's getting it out all that unnecessary unprocessed food that she was eating it's coming out like all the unhealthy stuff you're gonna shut it out and once you lose all that toxic weight you your belly weight your belly will go down tremendously you do not know how much toxic we absorb during the day like i've literally changed my eating though i've literally changed the way how i how i eat i don't know why i can't talk but i've changed the way how i ate since this whole quarantine started and not only because we're on lockdown but because i'm like damn like i really eat a lot of unprocessed food and that's why i tried the tea so basically after trying to see you know me and my mom we also get the liquid vitamin which i do not have i am going to complain with these people okay but i had the liquid vitamin which is finished so basically you take it in the morning i think you take it in the morning and at before you go to bed so in the morning you would take one cap right so you take a cap before you brush your teeth all of that before you brush your teeth and do all that you take one cap swallow that boom like a boss it don't taste nasty it actually tastes like orange juice don't get me wrong and i kid you not that one cap could give you so much energy that you need throughout the day it's ridiculous that it's a multivitamin and um it they keeps like i see a lot of pictures basically the nutriburst is like 10 10 salads in one in like in one whole little liquid vitamin i think it's like or one cap something like that one cap is equal to 10 bowls of salads right i'm gonna show a picture like right around here straight so this is the vitamin and this is the unprocessed food right and this is my body so i took a cap belly went down i'm eating the same food buddy come back up take a cat belly went down eat the same food better come back it's not it's like you're not going to see any results you know what i'm saying like because you keep doing the same things like i'm still eating the same way i didn't change the way i eat like the first time when i started the first time around i didn't change anything i didn't change nothing whatsoever so like i was getting irritated i'm like yo like are they playing with me but really that's something that i had to change eat what you love but don't be greedy about it you know what i'm saying still eat how you want to eat but watch how you eat it so like before when your rice used to fill up your whole plate and your chicken that was it don't make it be that much anymore like make your salad fill up your whole plate or like your steamed cabbage or your something if you're starting to like the results that you see says become a member sell your own stuff do what you got to do to make the money because the more people you qua you put underneath you the more cash you get you know what i'm not even getting in all of this because i'm just telling y'all you know how people do it nowadays you know what i'm saying surgery days are over when you could just have a rub just saying no i'm just playing watch the way how you eat so all that talking and now it's 12 36 so i'm still gonna go on and show you guys what it look like what the whole setup is and all of that so they have everything a little bit of everything i'll put it down in my description box below you do your own research there's videos out there on youtube that you can watch about it learn about it if you're not really into just trying things of like what you're just seeing you know you need to do a little bit of research because you take your body seriously okay do that buy this because i'm telling you to buy because you want to snatch belly get this is i don't mind you do it but i'm saying the tea and the nutriburst would help you because the tea make you poop out the toxic the nutriverse gives you the energy and then this snatches your body like can't go wrong can't go wrong cannot go wrong boom so anyways now after i'm gonna after i finish up with um checking my carts and checking out my people that signed up underneath me um so i'm in the bathroom yes yes i left in the room but since i'm not gonna do anything else i'm gonna do a mask i mean i didn't ask it's the aveeno cucumber i don't know i threw it
