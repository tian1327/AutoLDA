  hello everyone welcome back this is the first video you're seeing from me hi my name is Nana welcome I just moved to New York City pretty much right when quarantine started like the middle of March I moved I did kind of want to give you just like a look into what it's been like I do really want to take a walk outside it's like the most beautiful day so far and sunny I took the garbage out earlier which is like one of the only times I go outside and sadly enough it was beautiful I was like I have to come back out for a walk so I'm going to do that I'm going to wear my mask still later I really want to make banana bread I know that everyone is in making mist but I didn't have loaf pans and now I finally have them and I have some really ripe bananas I self-tans which is why I'm in like super loose baggy clothing right now I'm not wearing any makeup I worked out I did laundry I cleaned the entire part but today I just want to spend the rest of the day kind of relaxing later I'm going to do my nails and drink wine I'll probably order pizza for dinner so that that's one like my little mini New York City tradition so let's just go ahead and go on our walk   I'm back outfit number 700 of the day and I haven't left more than once so that was an interesting walk and I'll tell you about it more later but I'm sweating it was so nice outside and I'm so hot now so now I think I'm gonna make some lunch just hold myself over and then I'll get to the banana bread I'm very excited for and I'm also going to open the windows it's just so nice out I need some fresh air in the apartment I saw that Kourtney Kardashian had posted on who she's recipe for teeth whitening and it's coconut oil tumeric and baking soda I really want to try it so I'm gonna make that and do it and I'll let you know how it goes I have the ingredients that I'll be using right here so I followed the recipe but I fourth because they called for a half a cup of coconut oil and I just don't feel the need to use that much right now so I did instead of a half a cup of coconut oil I did two tablespoons and then I did a fourth a tablespoon of tumeric then I did fourth of a teaspoon of baking soda so it's mostly tumeric but it also smells like coconut oil so I don't know we'll see I have a toothbrush that I'll be using this for and they said it stains your toothbrush so I just changed out my toothbrush to a new one that I'm gonna use the one that I was using before for this so see how it goes they also said to brush your shade first so I did that and now could use some of this this is how much I put it on here we go well that was fun they said do it up to a minute so I did it up to him and I just brushed my teeth as normal but you probably don't need to you probably can just do the areas that you would be showing but I don't know I might as well just do your whole mouth that's the way I'm probably gonna do it but it definitely stains everything they said don't use them a white towel to wipe your mouth after so I use I'm using this paper towel I feel like it worked before I did this I actually reached out to my cousin who's in dental school and she's still in school you know by no means an expert yet but obviously this is what she's learning about she said coconut oil is really used for the oil pulling which kind of like pulls bacteria out then baking soda is not too abrasive that you can't use it you should be able to use it multiple times a day and that's really for more of the cleaning the tumeric is is supposed to help with like the staining which I guess is ironic because of just the orange color of it but I guess maybe that's the whole point it definitely stains your toothbrush so if you have like an electric toothbrush I would recommend just getting like a 90 cent one I don't even try it  so I have this whole wheat and corn flour I'm not sure how this is gonna turn out I've only had this a couple of times and never in baked goods usually just like a pizza crust or a pasta it's not gluten free but it's like pretty close to it I guess I don't know too much about the science behind it so I'm not even gonna try to explain it but it's just kind of better on my stomach so I'll see how this one is and this calls for some oats maple syrup I don't have enough but whatever we'll just go with it some very very ripe bananas so we'll see how those turn out coconut oil vanilla baking soda cinnamon salt and opposite our vinegar because they don't have baking powder and then these are the mini loaf pans that I got they're so cute I love them so excited to use them I got these from Bed Bath & Beyond because Amazon doesn't have any because I guess everyone's trying to make banana bread and they were pretty cheap and came in like two days  so you want to mix this in phases so you want to add the dry ingredients mix it up the key really here the key to baking really is just making sure that everything is blended without over mixing it I probably shouldn't be giving baking advice when I have a fork that I'm using to mix it and I used obviously the vinegar instead a bit better but once you kind of mix the dry ingredients with the wet don't want to be mixing it too too much I think one more that was a lot at once almost forgot the most important ingredient chocolate chips  hello my pizza got delivered I'm so excited I ordered a large which I don't know why I did that because it's huge and I'm one person so this is probably what I'll be eating for the next couple days so I poured my glass of wine New York City wine guys I just thought I would sit down with my pizza and just like talk about what has been going on so on my walk it was good to get outside and it was a beautiful day you would think in a place like New York City let everyone be wearing masks and everyone would be social distancing and take more precautions and for the most part like that is the case and there's always people that aren't I think the other thing that was interesting is there's just no cars there's no traffic there's less honking like there's just less noise everything is just quieter but people are out and about but it's just weird seeing like all the businesses closed cuz you would think in New York City on a Saturday people are coming in their restaurants and bars and it's just interesting to see my neighborhood like that one of the reasons I moved to this neighborhood in particular is because I really wanted to enjoy the restaurants and the bars and you know the stuff that New York City has to offer and I got that through ordering pizza and ordering wine for delivery and that's it so luckily restaurants are saying open they are delivering their livering wine I mean I haven't checked for groceries but I'm sure that someone's delivering groceries so I'm really thankful for that and it just makes me appreciate all those people that are on the front lines and I'm very grateful that I do work from home it's definitely scary and a little eerie to see New York City like this it's definitely different to see everything like this I don't know what the new normal will be after this I can't imagine that New York City will just open up all the bars and everything will be back to normal I just don't see that happening right away at least people are just trying to keep their spirits up but yeah I just wanted to kind of come on here and say that I don't know how everyone else's experiences are let me know how yours is  so nothing like pesto pesto is my favorite thing and they put I can't believe I saw pesto pizza I've never seen that cherries nothing like pizza and wine New York City Saturday night let's go hope everyone's been doing their Saturday night wherever you are  it's Sunday today I just worked out I showered and I'm gonna make some breakfast and then I think I'm gonna do my makeup and test out some new makeup products that I just got in the mail I'll show you what I'm wearing today literally the simplest outfit these joggers are from Amazon but they're like the most comfortable thing ever and they're thinner so they're they don't like give you that hot like fleecy feeling and then this top is from a ritzy I put it in my loungewear Hall if you ever watch that definitely go watch it so there's some good pieces in there and I've just been wearing them constantly so yeah and then I got these new bracelets from like an Instagram shop I'll try to find it again I got this necklace from Etsy   I was halfway through making my breakfast I realize I've been at coffee yeah how have I been surviving I don't know if you if you know me you know that's the first thing I do in the morning quarantine is messing up my routine here I don't know what's going on crazy hello guys so I am gonna sit down and do my makeup but I must show you that any things that I got from Ulta really like nothing too fancy but I wanted to try a couple new things I always get this lash paradise and actually unboxing anything so everything's still in packaging but I always get this luminous lash Paradise Wario best Scarah and I always get the blackest black color but I wanted to try something different I wanted to try the black Brown I feel like I want to make my makeup more Brown toned I feel like that looks better with my hair color my skin cooked my skin tone pretty much everything so I figured now while I'm in quarantine what better time to test it out so I'm excited to see what that color looks like I think a big prom for me is I don't have super long lashes so I want to make sure that they still get that lengthening effect and look a little bit more pronounced but without eating it look too harsh with black so I said to try that I also got this is also L'Oreal this voluminous primer base so I've heard people are swearing by priming their mascara with a primer so I really wanted to try that I haven't done it it's just a white primer I've seen a couple of people use like a Marc Jacobs one or very more expensive one but I wanted to try out like a cheap version and then if I liked it then I can upgrade it's like a Marc Jacobs one so I'm excited to see how that looks and then I got just a brown gel eyeliner in the color mink it's literally the Olsen Beatty brand I just wanted to try out like a cheap one and then see how it works and then I got this color pop brow boss eyepencil I got it in the shade light brown my eye roller code weird like in some light there blonde and then like they're brown like right now they look pretty dark my hair looks pretty dark normally I mean my hair usually gets a lighter when I'm out in the Sun but since I'm not on the Sun I think it's just getting darker you can see the the ends of my hair definitely like lighter than my roots at this point we'll see how this color ends up looking for me but I've heard good things about the color pop proud boss and then I just got my favorite tweezer from Revlon this is like my third one of these it's just it's really good for a non-budget tweezer and I have like 800 of these so I got a new one cuz I like to get them and I think I talked about just my last of my labs or video but I got these like little elastic things not to tie my t-shirt it's not makeup related but I want to mention it I I mean they just sit down do my makeup use some of these products and we'll see how it goes    all right well it's been three hours since I sat down to do my makeup which is absolutely insane it's insane who takes that long to do their makeup I regret it to say the least no but honestly at least it was good that I got to try some new products and test out some new techniques you this banana bread so I don't you know I don't actually regret it I think it was good I definitely needed to kind of revamp my makeup routine anyway so I thought I was able to do that but now I'm just annoyed it took me that long and I just want to take it all off and like do a face mask or something but before I do that I'm probably gonna eat something today flew by I can't believe it's like four o'clock already on Sunday I will say I really love the individual false lashes I will link them down below I really recommend I am not spend that everyone wears false lashes I can't get them on it's just a big hassle for me but the individual ones were so much easier and I feel like they look now that they look natural because that's not really what I was going for but they look a little bit more just like they kind of flow with my regular eyelets just cuz I don't have long eyelashes so I felt like the faux lashes just looked it was just like too much on me but highly recommend these if you're like me and you don't have like eyelashes at all and then I really liked the the brown shade of the mascara and I really likes the primer as well so I'll link those down below - I I definitely noticed a difference with the primer so I think it was cheap it was only like six dollars or something like that I like the brown look a lot better on me I think it just makes a little bit more sense I wouldn't say I'm in love with this makeup look and I'm by no means like a makeup artist or anything like that but I do like how turned out I think I'm gonna end off this vlog here I hope you enjoyed it let me know what other videos you'd like to see from me don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you in the next one
