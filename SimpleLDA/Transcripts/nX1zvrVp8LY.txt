 hello friends welcome back to my channel today I am going to be sharing a fun video and it is going to be my March favorites video this video is just going to be of some of the things that I have been loving the past month and then also some ideas for the next couple of weeks while we are still in quarantine or self isolation self distancing whatever you want to call it just some ideas and things that I have been doing to keep myself busy during these few weeks and so if you guys are new here hello my name is Seeley I'm a first year kindergarten teacher I've been vlogging my whole experience in than loving every minute of it and so if you want to stay tuned to see the rest of my videos please make sure you hit that subscribe button also if you like this video please make sure to give it a thumbs up and if you guys would like to see a classroom favorites video please let me know down below in the comments because I would love to film that for you guys so I'm just gonna go through some of the things I've been loving lately and they're in no particular order but let's get started okay so the first favorite that I want to talk about is a water bottle so this is a plain white water bottle but it is 32 ounces it's like us I don't know if it's stainless steel but it's like an insulated water bottle so it keeps your water very very cold and it keeps it cool for like 12 hours or something I have loved this thing if you've been watching my vlogs and you know that I had this all the time when I was teaching it's such a life saver because I only have to fill it up like once or twice a day and I just am able to drink all the water that I want and so this is from Amazon I think it was around $30 but I would say that it's totally worth it it's cheaper than like a hydro flask and it looks really cute and so I definitely have been loving this even when I'm home I just always have it with me even if I go to the store whatever I'm doing and I always have this with me so highly highly recommend also all the items that I talked about in this video I will have linked below in my Amazon storefront if I can find them or similar items that are similar to the ones that I've shown you all right another item that I have been loving is this Dickinson original witch hazel you guys this is a game-changer for my skin like as soon as I started using this I've been using this for like two to three weeks and I've only used like this much of it it doesn't need very much when you apply it and it's like changed my face like it instantly started cleaning up my face my face I've been dealing with acne as you guys probably know since basically the beginning of the school year I don't know maybe because I'm stressed who would have thought being a teacher is stressful but recently it's been even worse probably because of all the things going on and so I started using this and it's changed my face like I'm so excited to see where my face is that in like a couple weeks because it's already healed so so much and so I just apply this with a cotton ball in the morning and at night after I cleanse my face and so I highly highly recommend this one if you guys are interested in like a skincare routine I can definitely film one of those too and just kind of show like where my face started and where it is now it's not completely healed by any means and it's not perfect probably never will be but it came a long way so I highly recommend this going along with that theme this is my absolute favorite asker at it makes my eyelashes so wrong you guys like I've you been using this for probably like eight months or something and I start using it it was amazing like everyone started commenting on my lashes and they're like oh my gosh you have such long eyelashes and I'm like the same thing that's before but this is a game changer so this is the L'Oreal telescopic mascara and the blackest black I believe are like the darkest black color they have and this is what it looks like it's like nine or ten dollars you can get it on Amazon you can also go to like Target or rubber um I love this stuff it makes your eyelashes just so long and so I would definitely suggest looking into it if you're interested another beauty favorites are I've discovered recently is sea salts right I feel like this was like a trend way back when but Warren he's one hour looked into sea salt spray it first I've started using this and I'm obsessed like I have very fine soft hair and so my hair gets greasy really fast and it just is very flat and so this adds a ton of texture into my hair and so after I take a shower I will just spray this into my hair like the night before or the day of whatever and just let it sit overnight and then my carrier like has a lot more texture to it which is really nice and so this is the kick active sea salt spray it's pretty inexpensive I think it was like fourteen dollars off of Amazon and so I will have this linked below as well next day right is a French press so Warren actually got me this French press before Christmas but because we're home old time now we've been using it like every single day every morning and it's been so nice because the coffee is like so strong and it's fresh and I just love it so much and so this one is from Target I think I believe but you can get these anywhere I really really like this one it's very simple to use I thought it would be a little bit more confusing but it's honestly like the most simple way to make coffee and I really like it because we have a coffee bean grinder and so we'll buy fresh beans and then grind the coffee yourself so we have fresh ground coffee every morning I love this thing okay another favorite this was actually sent to me by my friend Maddy her Instagram and YouTube name is primarily yours I will link her channel down below as well as her Instagram she sent me this coloring book if you watched my latest blog I am obsessed with this you guys like it's such a like therapeutic thing for me to do especially during this time to kind of just like quiet my mind put in an audiobook or listen to some music and just color this counter book and so I've actually done a couple of pages in here so I've done this page and it's just like such cute pictures and like simple like they're not super overwhelming and then I started this one as well and so I love this thing so Maddie if you're watching thank you so much for sending me this because it is a favorite of mine and I everyone getting this because it's so cute and then along with that I bought these super tips Crayola washable markers I know that a lot of people actually use these for anchor charts and so when we go back to school I'm saying when not if when we go back to school I'm going to use these markers but possibly for anger types as well and so I really like these they're very fine tip and so they're good for coloring but they're pretty inexpensive for quite a few colors so I really like these as well another favorite of mine are Bluetooth earbuds if you guys have not boughten Bluetooth earbuds yet I would highly recommend these are obviously not the air paws from Apple but these work so well and they're like a quarter of the price I think these are like thirty or forty dollars I love these they're so good so they just look like this on the inside so this is a little touching case and then the little earbuds just like look like this I actually don't like Apple earbuds like they don't fit in my ear I have like pretty small ears and they just like severely uncomfortable for me and so I really like this kind of headphone when it's like this squishy I don't know squishy earbud I don't know I really like these they've been really nice for when I'm like cleaning around the house or singing outside or exercising whenever I'm doing these just pop into my ears and I don't have to worry about any cords I think these were like $40 on Amazon more and actually got these for me as well and then they just plug in to like a normal USB trigger I love these okay my latest favorite that I invested in was a Nintendo switch and I bought Animal Crossing I love this it was the smartest thing for me to do right now smartest and also maybe not the smartest because I spend a lot of time playing but I love this game it's so much fun the last Animal Crossing game that I played was like the Nintendo DS one when I was in like fifth or sixth grade but I invested in a switch and this game and I love them I do not regretting that at all it's been so much fun for me and very nostalgic to be able to play and I so I've been like playing online with to my friends that we played with when we were in like the parade and so it's been super fun I love this game it came out like six days ago or seven days ago highly recommend I love it okay so another favorite of mine is actually an app so if you follow me on Instagram I've been talking about this app for the last couple of weeks and it is the Livi app I will show you guys what it looks like on the phone so this is what the app looks like in the app store so I have a library card and so my public library hooks up to the Livi app and I know there's some other apps that libraries use as well but it's so nice because you have access to audio books for free and so I actually used to have audible last summer and I would pay for books but now I can read books and listen to books on the app without having to pay so it's so nice let me see so all you do is like hook up your library card and then your screen will look like this and then you can have books on hold and you can read different books and listen to them and so right now I'm listening to the Maze Runner I have been using this app more than any other app on my phone during these past few weeks and I highly recommend also with the Livia you can download like the actual book so if you have like a Kindle or your actual phone you can read the book on your Kindle or your phone and so I would highly recommend looking into your public library to see if they have some sort of like audiobook app thing that you can access because it's been amazing it's like a top favorite of mine right now going into books I have been reading a ton of books it was one of my new year's resolutions this year or like New Year's goals to read a book a month and I have been able to do that and so I wanted to share some of the books that I have read this year and have been loving the past couple of months because I know we have a lot of time right now and a great way to use that time is reading some of the books I have like hard copy some of the books I read on the Libya and then some books I used to have hard copies and I've given them to my friends or donated them after I finished them so the first thing I wanted to talk about was the girl before by JP Delaney so this is a like brother I would say it's a very intense book this is an adult book not a children's book I finished this book in two sittings and like it's not a short book like it asked quite a few pages it has like almost 450 pages and so the fact I finished this into settings shows like how intense it is it's very intense it's kind of similar genre to like the girl on the train if you've read that book it's very good it's like a psychological suspense thriller book Warren actually read it and he read it in like two days as well and so I really highly recommend this book if you're into that kind of stories if you're not then maybe not but it's a really good thing another book that I have like hard copy is this book and it's how to be yourself I read this book in January this is all about conquering social anxiety and just kind of like I don't even know how to describe it it's just a really good book and so I actually like went through and like highlighted in journals as I was reading this because I struggle with anxiety and I didn't really know if it was social anxiety it's just all about like how to overcome social anxiety and not in like a cheesy way it's very practical it's not very wordy like it's pretty straight to the point it has like stories of people and it's just really relatable and I really resonated with it and so this is what it's called it's called how to be yourself by Ellen Hendrickson I really like this so some other books that I have read recently let me just look on this app to see what else I've read okay the tattooist of auschwitz by Heather Morris I love this book it was such a good book oh my gosh I could not put it down I was listening to it on the Livia app and I finished it in like a day I just put my headphones on clean the entire house and listened to this book and finished it it was so good oh my gosh I can't highly recommend it enough it's about the tattooist of Auschwitz and his story and how he survived everything that happened and how he met like a girl and stuff it's just so good another book I've read recently is little fires everywhere this book is pretty good it's not like my favorite book of all time but it was pretty good I would recommend that one as well so I'm just gonna kind of scroll through my Goodreads app and show you guys what books I've read recently and so girl wash your face the help what Alice forgot this is like one of my favorite all-time books ever little fires everywhere this is a really good book as well I finished this one in like a couple of days as well and then educated I highly highly highly recommend that you read that book it's so good and then let's see if there's any other ones on here this is the Goodreads app if you have a Goodreads profile you can add me on there you can see what we're reading oh yeah and big little lies by Andy I also read this book in January and it's really good as well so those are some of the books that I've been reading recently if you are in need of some suggested books I love all of those books and would recommend them so now I'm going to kind of wrap up this video with some of the things that I am going to be doing in clinics two weeks so we actually this week are starting to do some training and stuff on Google classroom thank goodness because we will finally be able to do some online learning once the district is able to distribute laptops or Chromebooks to all the families and so I've also have some free time and then also next week is spring break so we won't be doing anything and so for the next two weeks I have some things that I'm going to be doing that I thought I would share with you guys because we all have a lot of free time so coming up I am going to do a 30 day challenge and so if you guys go on to like Pinterest or Google whatever you want to use and search like 30 day AB challenge 30 day running challenge whatever you want to do I'm going to be doing a 30 day like ab slash squad / running challenge I kind of like combined three different templates that I saw online I'm just gonna kind of do my own thing I just need something to kind of like put me into a routine and get my body moving and kind of feel like I'm like working towards something and kind of give me like a little bit of a drive or passion I'm teaching right now so that's what I'm going to be doing I will link the ones that I'm going to be doing down below but I would just highly recommend using this time to kind of like find something that you can find passion and because for me I need something to be working towards and right now I don't really have that so that's why I am struggling a bit so I'm super excited to be doing this I actually started yesterday and so yeah if you want to do it check online on Pinterest and then we can do something together some other things that I'm going to be doing I think I'm going to try and make my own homemade bread I've been seeing tons and tons of people do this because we're all home right now and so I think that's something that I might be doing it soon I'm also going to be making some new playlists like a running playlist a like calm playlist I don't know lots of different playlists because I have time to finally do that another thing I'm going to be doing is writing letters to my families I know a ton of teachers have done this I have been waiting a little bit so that we like had some time apart before I set them off and so I'm gonna be writing cards to my families this week I'm also going to start looking into like summer PD classes I don't know if I've talked about it on here but I am going to be finishing my masters June 1st yes I'm so excited and so I will have a lot of free time over the summer and so I want to look into some different like professional development classes I could do online so I'm gonna be doing that I'm also wanting to do some like DIY projects and so I want to make sensory bottles where you like have like coconut oil or something inside the bottle some coconut oil I don't know what people use I need to research that but like sensory bottles for kids to use where there's like glitter and stars and stuff inside the bottles and they can like flip it and it's just like a very relaxing tool that students can use so I want to make those and I also want to organize some of my curriculum materials I brought home like all my curriculum if you guys saw my vlog and so I'm gonna go through and so in our lessons like it refers to certain pages of the mentor texts and like says ask this question and so I'm going to be taking sticky notes and going through those putting in the questions on those pages so I will never have to do that again it will just be done for me so those are some of the things that I'm going to be doing over the next couple of weeks to keep myself busy I'm also obviously going to be looking into like classroom and setting up different assignments and projects and figure out exactly what we're gonna be doing and so I will definitely keep you guys
