 hello ladies gentlemen and welcome to borders and boundaries for those of you who are maybe not familiar with the channel hello my name is Rob I work for an airline I travel the world taking you guys with me getting after all sorts of nonsense really today after a ten and a half hour flight which is long in all fairness added with an hour-and-a-half delay at Heathrow because someone broke the jetty and it wouldn't come away from the aircraft I am here in LA I'm going straight to bed I know that's an anticlimax and I apologize for it I really do but I am absolutely naked its hammering it down with rain and no one's up for doing anything everyone is absolutely cream-crackered absolutely shattered we're tired we're all going to bed not together 22 people cannot fit in there I won't do a room tour because you guys have seen one before on this channel but I want to address the whole borders and boundaries thing guys thank you so much for the kind words about the artwork and the name and stuff like that I I love the long way up it was a nice little channel to have but we've got to move on we've got to build up especially when certain TV company don't want me to use that name so my plan I've got three local nights including this one that's two whole clear days folks who need to go up some trouble here in Los Angeles I'm thinking of doing the ice hockey tomorrow the Ducks and the Senators playing we'll see how that goes but for now I'm going to bed I'll see you in the morning so long for now good morning Los Angeles and well the weather not exactly what I had in mind for my two clear days here the Sun is is shining over there in in Los Angeles but for us out here in Hana hime it is moist it is moist to say the least ladies and gentlemen that is not going to stop us from having a good time because either tonight or tomorrow night we haven't quite decided yet we are going to go to the ice hockey we're never gonna see the Anaheim Ducks play very excited and never done a an ice hockey game before so quite excited for that actually but still time is a-wasting we need to get ourselves together I'm not even gonna bother putting wax in the hair today because apparently is just gonna be pouring down all day it will be a waste and this place I'll play it through the press everyone Jesus Christ no right Alan about time for breakfast and always as on every trip we have to make pilgrimage to the holy Cathedral that did good old target also known as tarjay in cabin crew circles let's go and find some bargains that we never knew we wanted oh it is no rest for the wicked I am back from Target with the good old fashioned crystal dye and also the destined nappy cream for my daughter and also to the B I've got the Pepsi Max chillin and the milk for my protein shake tomorrow so all is well next step however is off to the outlets I did say I was gonna be spending a lot of money on this trip and it's so far it's gone horribly wrong so yeah now get myself together and I think we're gonna walk it today and the weather has been less than great so I can only hope it doesn't start absolutely hammering it that the time hotel so we have Worcester we decide to go for an uber I can't blame anyone really is horrible weather here at the moment it's only a matter of time before the heavens open and we get absolutely soaked and the heavens have now opens here in LA Jesus I've never known a state to suffer from so many wildfires to be as wet as it has been since I've been here it is absolutely mad considering the stuff that I've seen I've done very well not to buy anything I'm actually quite proud of myself you see I just splurge a splurge it's safe but no I guess we'll see I still a little while that yeah we still got to go to Guitar Center as well see if I can still play guitar I'll probably end up buying a 2000 pound guitar or something like that but Christ I'm impressed so far I really really are I just took the edge don't get struck by lightning now yeah be a remix  earn such a child I think it goes without saying I've clearly missed my calling in life I thought it was going group I thought it was just being a flight attendant that's what I was good at but obviously not that piece of footage clearly demonstrates that I should be going by the name DJ big chunga's from now on available for funerals kids parties bar mitzvahs you name it I will take any bookings because we've got to make that money talking of money it's something that I avoid talking about on this channel because well it's a bit of a serious subject and this channel is far from serious at the end of the day but it's something that we've got to talk about especially at the moment this C vid 19 the coronavirus whatever you want to call it it's it's it's getting scary now personally for me flu flu swine flu flu through SARS survive Justin Bieber you know I've been through all sorts of Horrors in my flying career so it didn't really faze me that much but now things are getting very very serious virgin rumor has it this is only rumor have grounded a lot of cabin crew they've suspended all new entrants and it's basically looking like they're shutting down a big part of the airline and that is terrifying that is absolutely terrifying so um what's happened is ba have kind of followed suit with a lot of these plans two to three weeks after so a lot of us especially maybe in under a year now are kind of waiting to hear that maybe we are going to be stood down for a month or two which of course would be the video would be devastating it really really would be but hey there we are I guess we just go across that bridge when we come to it sorry for being so serious I don't do now on this channel right in is almost nights I'm here in LA some people are going to Downtown Disney I am saving my money for the ice hockey tomorrow night very looking forward very much looking forward to that so well I'm gonna leave it here and I'll see you in the morning so long for now folks good morning from LA and the world's dirtiest hotel windows I've ever seen in the world I mean honestly just just look do I not know that people are trying to vlog here Jesus Christ but all is not lost however because at the moment it is not raining and I brought my friend with me now as a responsible drone owner and flier I would actually probably say that this is not the perfect area really not bad at all I'm gonna fly too close to the hotel but yeah I think we can probably do something down here I just need to avoid this ocean in the middle because yeah these shoes aren't really built for getting wet I am absolutely gutted I am so annoyed I'll show you why basically I am within a no-fly zone here in LA and I keep forgetting not only we've got LAX we've got our vine we've got Compton as well all of them have airspace above me not that my drone can get that high because it's not that kind of drone it's not one of these big flash ones but still hopefully the map that you'll see on screen now will kind of explain to you why I can't fly my drone and I'm so annoyed I was really looking forward to flying it here but obviously not ah god damn it now I've got to find something else to do with my time it's probably gonna involve money because I can't control myself now I am absolutely shocking at basketball but I must be must be honest I am kind of tempted really oh oh hang on a second well that completely rules out anything that I was planning to do today I think we know when it comes to sports I have got mad skills at the end of the day let's see how badly did Koby Koby would be ashamed maybe if we go straight from under it we might have a little bit more luck there we go full future NBA Hall of Famer incoming all that hardcore sporting action it's probably time for breakfast now I'd say as I had yesterday because I did have like the typical American breakfast but today something a little bit better for me there's a couple of sports shops nearby that I want to go check out as well and then it's on to the ice hockey this evening very excited local team the Anaheim Ducks taking on the current leaders in the league from what I believe it's a Lewis blues eight nine of us going she could be real good fun actually I think every now and then on trips you need to take time out just to do absolutely nothing I think with me going to Australia I kind of want to do as much as I can but I've kind of got to be careful as monies for money as well but today I mean we've had breakfast weather is okay everyone's kind of just hanging on for tonight really so I'm taking time to just sit in bed now watch your bit of TV I've managed to find myself a bit of South Park which is it might my guilty pleasure really when it comes to TV it is just so mean to so many different groups of people I don't know how they get away with it but it just it does make me chuckle so this is it this is this is me for a little while until hockey tonight and then maybe tomorrow we'll go back to the outlets maybe try and find some bargains I'm sure there must be sewing there for me to buy I must have just looked in the wrong place but yeah ah make the most of this luxury so it is game time well nearly game time here in La Vie Anaheim Ducks taking on the San Luis Blues tonight in the ice hockey really excited I want to get there early I want the full experience I want the anthems the light show I'm probably gonna buy myself a giant foam finger or something like that that's the kind of stupid stuff that I would usually do but yeah let's get going now the game awaits us folks      here we go      no way green dye   with   oh good save tom boys and lads  oh jesus ground the hell that he stopped that     they are not paying that apron up we go it's me 20 minutes the landed in zero up against the null tea box think about what you've done  darkness    Walter go  you're damaged  three two to them I'm gone  better points rafi from the cloud and I regard that is the end god damn it  what a spectacular evening I had a great time I really did I didn't think I'd like hockey as much as I have done Wow on TV it is so different you can't see the puck and the camera angles where we were admittedly we were in the cheap seats we were up in the nosebleeds but you had such a good view of any everything and there's only one thing that I'm disappointed that there was no fight there was no fights and I didn't get on the big screen because I had some moves ready to go should the camera come to me but there there we go I've got my collectors cup to show for it and some fantastic memories of the night and I've been so lucky with this crew they have been absolutely amazing I suggested going to the hockey thinking but no one was going to go which doesn't bother me because I don't need anyone's ago I would have gone by myself if I had to but a lot of people turned up eight nine people in total including myself so it was great it was fantastic a really good time wonderful evening and my last evening here in LA so it's time for bed maybe a little bit of Netflix first and see whatever I get up to in the morning and then all of a sudden my whole mood changes geez I I i I've had my concerns as I said in the video earlier but now Donald Trump has suspended all travel from Europe to the US from what I understand this does not include the UK at least I hope it doesn't because then what will happen is the aircraft won't leave Heathrow tomorrow to fly me home which means I could be stuck here so from what I understand and what we're reading at the moment it doesn't mean that it's the hold of your it does mean it's that the UK is just mainland Europe so you're talking France Italy Belgium Germany everyone like that geez I I'm gobsmacked I I didn't think it would go this far I didn't think it would go this far is this gonna is this gonna change stuff for me it could do it might mean that everyone from Europe is now going to come through the UK are I if they're allowed to it might only be like UK nationals who have been screen are allowed to fly to the US oh this is mad I'm gonna have to watch a good few hours of this get all the facts and then maybe tomorrow morning we can try and like just I don't know but put our heads together but this is this is this is serious now I I didn't think it would go this far so it is 11 past 6:00 in the morning I haven't watched any TV yet about the Hulk coronavirus man in the US I'm feeling good so I might as well go to the gym and just make the most of a bad situation for what we believe the aircraft is gonna leave Heathrow today so madness right let's get this day started right then you know things are seriously breaking out that way this one this is that should be quite fun weird I know I'm actually quite enjoy this movie but that supposed to be about a parent pretty pound shake and an apple so I have left the gym gotten the lift gone up to my floor come out the lift and as these doors opened I bumped into this bloke not surprising it's a hotel that's not just me staying here but this guy look like the old American version of you me gray hair gray bid and we looked at each other for like 30 seconds but just to there and I went are you a time traveler it was the weirdest thing I wish it wasn't weird for me to take out my phone and show you because I would love to us I actually do you think I can show you give me a second all right so picture this floor 13 kucik obviously without cream on his face it was white hair but Jesus you would just the old blue you rub rub in the future maybe somehow I've become some kind of big-time youtuber and I've got some mad money behind me and I can become some like kind of traveling Time Lord but Jesus Christ I gotta say you know this could be a look for me I think I'm embracing the gray when it happens I'm embracing it Phil on it's gonna happen I think I couldn't pull it off my dad went great quite early I think it's only a matter of time before a happens to me as well but now I like this this is good so I might actually go down and like this later the uniforms pick up who knows you
