 what's good YouTube its Louis gussto welcome back to my channel a couple of months ago I did a day in the life of a software engineer and you guys really responded well to that well for the past few weeks I've been working from home and so my daily routine is completely different and so I thought it was time to do another day in the life of a software engineer this time they're working from home edition so if you're ready let's go ahead and get started whether I'm going into the office or working from home my daily routine starts exactly the same I come straight to the kitchen make some coffee today I got some locally made metric coffee and of course my daily greens these are key for me to get a great start to the day  hi now it's time to get to work working from home saves me time on my commute instead of 30 minutes on the bus I simply walk five seconds from the washroom to my desk once I've had my coffee and I'm ready for the day I go to my desk as you can see my workstation at home is much simpler than the one I have at the office I like to keep things more minimalist at home but in the future I may pick up an external monitor my day starts around 8 a.m. and usually goes to about 5 p.m. for the past 4 plus years I've developed software in the FinTech industry working for financial services companies I'm a full-stack engineer in my current role I work in the database layer the backend and the front-end my company is a Microsoft shop so we used asher for cloud services sequel for the database c-sharp on the server side and our front-end framework is angular we use git for our source control and slack for team communication at 9:30 it's time for my stand-up meeting of course since we're all working from home these days this must be done via web conferencing in our stand-up meeting we talk about the things we completed the previous day and the tasks that we'll be taking on today some of the tools I utilized to help me get my work done include Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Visual Studio code sequel server management studio commander and postman when you work from home you have to be extra discipline so that you can be more productive than you would be if you were in the office I sit at my desk most of the day but other times I'll go to the couch to get a little bit more comfortable I studied computer engineering at the University of Florida go Gators and completed the software engineering master's degree program at DePaul in my position as software engineer I'm involved with backlog refinement tasking architecture and design implementation testing deployment and maintenance some of the benefits of working from home are saving time by not commuting and being able to create an atmosphere conducive to focusing a couple of the drawbacks are not being able to interact with my co-workers in person and not getting the homework separation last time I mentioned that I worked with some really smart people and this time I'd like to mention some of the best software engineers in Chicago by name shout-out to Abel Dave and Jimmy those guys are real wizards behind the keyboard it's important to take an actual lunch break when working from home today I'm enjoying some chicken and cilantro dumplings after I eat I play some piano on my Yamaha 88-key digital piano this allows me to get a nice mental break from all the coding and software design work I also take some time to read during my lunch break as a software engineer it's important to be constantly learning today I'm reading secrets of the JavaScript ninja it was recommended to me by my good buddy Dave I have a small library of software books on my shelf from vintage classics like design patterns to new school favorites like the well-grounded rubyist on loan from my buddy Abel currently I've been doing a lot of front-end work and angular I build the front end using the command line tool commander then run the solution from Visual Studio my browser of choice is Firefox this is where I run the application Firefox is web developer tools are super useful for seeing console output HTML code and network calls when I make a code change in Visual Studio code I save it and the front-end automatically rebuilds then I refresh the browser and can test my update once I'm done with the code for a particular task I use git to check it in then head to Azure DevOps to create a pull request after that I send the link to my teammates for review and inspection I complete the pull request after receiving a sufficient amount of approvals at 5:00 p.m. I stop to get in a home workout my gym is currently closed but I don't let that stop me from continuing to work toward my fitness goals today I'm doing a routine that I got from my buddy Jimmy who's also an avid gym rat as well as an excellent software engineer  after I workout I have a protein shake and take a shower before finishing up my work items for the day I like to wrap up any loose end so I start the next day on a good note and just like that another work from home day is done my preference is of course going into the office but as we all know we're working from home a lot more these days I'm truly blessed as a software engineer to be able to work from home and still be productive if you made it to the end of this video go ahead and finesse that like button and if you new to my channel it would really mean the world to me if you subscribe I'll see you in the next video have a great rest of your day peace
