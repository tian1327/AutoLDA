  my friends they need them out this one was super bad scene I don't know why I'm doing this like 8:30 in the morning but  just went ahead and wrote out today's to-do list I like to put it on my knee just so I see it and kind of visualize it is currently 9:30 I have my brain thinks I'm gonna unbraid them later and have like heatless little waves probably be really insane though because I braided it while it was wet yesterday and I slept in it I had it in all days it's gonna be kind of crazy um but it's Tuesday if you guys are new here you should hit that subscribe button I was actually looking at my analytics which honestly I really don't do that often so many people who watch these videos aren't subscribes yeah it's Tuesday this morning I have a very fun day planned today I have lots of stuff to actually get done which is nice I like like actually being busy I needed to posit a check and a lot of times when I get paid from brands the ATM does not like my checks it never accepts them and my mobile deposit ever accepts them and even one time I went in and tried to deposit it and the teller literally thought it was supposed to be a fake check and I think it's just because like I look really young I just look like I'm like 18 years old if that maybe even 16 she like warned me if I like posited a fake check it would be fraud I was like I'm literally depositing a check for my job you can go through the drive-thru and like talk to the teller but not be like face to face like it's really far I'll show you guys when I go through so I'm not in communication with people that I'm hoping that'll work I have a few things I want to do I need to finish some edits for a brand or a video that I did I need to change a couple things that I just want to change and then I'm gonna work out I think I might just go for a really long walk I'm used to walking in New York just don't walk a lot here and so I kind of rather do that I did a really long run on Sunday and I've been talking about this forever but I need to submit quarter one taxes ready to go I just need to actually pay the money and so I'm gonna do that even though technically I don't think you have to pay right now it's deferred actually I think that's for 2019 this is just quarterly taxes so at 3:00 my time I have a call with a brand I'm reporting a podcast with someone not for my podcast but for hers you guys enjoy I'm trying to do like different videos that aren't just vlogs these always perform the best and I know that they're sometimes repetitive I got a comment on one videos like please make less repetitive videos so I feel like I try to make less repetitive videos and they never perform as well and let me know it's your life pretty repetitive right now if you are fortunate enough to be able to stay at home is your life pretty repetitive let me know down below I'd love to hear because mine personally it's pretty repetitive oh also it's Eden's birthday on April 16th and so I'm sending him a package that I had purchased the stuff for already and so I'm gonna put everything in just go ahead and get this box started thank you it is such a pretty day outside I kind of want to lay out someone told me you should lay out for 15 minutes without sunscreen and then put sunscreen on because like getting that amount is good get like vitamin D and I really do want to get deep I'm about to package up this package for him but these are the things that I got him he really likes just having like t-shirts to wear so I got him to Texas t-shirt got a little postcard and then some Bucky snacks you really likes beef jerky so got him those I'm gonna package it up his real presents gonna come when we can actually like go outside I think just like whenever we go back to New York City I'm gonna do like an actual like really nice date looks like he's actually and I want to hang out something to remember while we're apart and I think the Texas stuff is really cute  so I just got back from my book just now I've been really liking my workout schedule as of lately I've been doing a lot of different workouts and I feel like my body has just really been enjoying it so I pretty much alternate between doing hit workout if I do hit workouts I usually do 40 minutes to an hour and I do them from Sidney Cummings as you guys know I love her workouts and I love them so much because they're really the only workouts that make me sweat as much as I sweat when I run and I really like sweating when I workout mamie actually didn't with me the other day and it was so hard and she really really liked it because it really kicked her but she actually didn't like it she said that it's made her the most or she's been in a while and then some days I've run I usually run about three times a week now I've been running about four miles I'm just running outside and then on the days that I don't want to do that I will walk usually go for like an hour and a half long walk if I have the time to which is what I did today and it feels so good alternating between those and I usually breath honestly only once a week now sometimes on Sundays or Saturdays I just won't do anything but I do try to go outside on the days that I rest but that's why my workout schedule it's been really great sometimes I'll do like a heavier arm workout because they did tell you guys I'm trying to really strengthen my arms I really feel like my arms have gotten a whole lot stronger than they used to be I used to like not have any arm string and I would only ever use like five pound weights and now I use tens for like most of them so I really feel like getting stronger so it feels good do you know those things about the shower because I just feel really gross it was really hot outside and so I'm super sweaty gonna put on some real clothes think I'm just gonna wear like a little flowy dress and then do the rest of my work today it's been so nice like not using heat on my hair not putting makeup on I feel like my skin has really liked it I did eat ice cream last night so I think it a little bit of breakouts from that I just went ahead and changed if I look super oily it's because I'm using this like coconut melt as a moisturizer on my body it's from Kapaa I'm using it for the first time and it feels so good on my skin I put it on and then I'm wearing this dress which I thrifted but it's originally from made well and I really like it just like this super comfy little dress I'm eating a wrap my mom made chicken salads or just have this some spinach everyone's in my room right now cuz the power went off we going crazy yeah I definitely feeling crazy gross feed I just do this Jamie what do you do for your job I paid feel like people want to know that's so baby you're like financially I use a lot of programs and I put information in and I build but what kind of company do you work you don't say the company but what kind of company but are we talk about this in a video look you didn't I'm in defense contracting she's got a big monitor and they're really not that smart people think people with jobs is smart really just about showing up is happy oh but everyone's congregating in my room because our power went out and I was so excited cuz I had all my things planned yeah we were supposed to I know I'm supposed to start Apache today just like a huge program been really nice to be home like with my family during this time and kind of before jumping into a new season of life later on in the year it's been like super nice to spend you know a solid month that maybe even more cuz we don't really know how long this will go along but it's nice to spend time with family and I've been really thankful for it our power came on but the Wi-Fi isn't working I'm rescheduling the podcast interview I was supposed to do with Emily just because I obviously can't use my internet and it's Thursday caster and so I'm gonna move that to some time for the rest of the week and hopefully it comes on your in a little bit but until then I think I'm just gonna do everything that I can still have data on my phone which is nice I can still like answer emails and do that kind of stuff but I probably just gonna do some editing so salad I've rescheduled with her so many times I feel bad exciting moment of the day I literally just got some new blue light glasses in the mail these are from Felix gray they're so pretty I'm actually doing like a sponsored video with them but I was so excited because I used to wear these ones I was literally just writing them they're from barner they're like another blue light glasses frames but these ones are actually prescription these ones are just like you wear them when you look at the computer but this is actually like my prescription in it because I don't have perfect eyesight but it's not so bad where I like half-door glasses or contacts all the time it probably these little guys are so cute I love like the really bright tortoiseshell I feel like they're so pretty multiple people actually messaged me and said that my link for some reason they would order them and they would never get them in the mail and it would take like two weeks and no one was responding to them so the customer service was just like not great and so I felt bad promoting them because people would always ask where they were from but people literally weren't getting their glasses and so I'm so excited in these Felix gray ones come in they're so cute I love these ones so much so nicer prescription and these ones are nice because they shield the blue eye without having to be like this super purple lens so I'm really really excited about them I think that they're so cute this isn't sponsored but I have a link down below if you're interested I just got really excited because I'm like staring at a screen all the time now which is probably bad I see daddy on a jet pack in the sky Pegasus is like a horse with wings lovely it's a flying horse that's not very bright on the camera like right there not be good morning I love the dinosaur on your shirt thank you hey you miss mr. Eden's yeah yeah I do miss him I can't I like him too Ali Ali gets birthday this is birthday soon Alex's is you're gonna eat cake on his birthday yeah he's gonna open presents I like a pink puppet you want a pink present yeah your birthday's in a little bit you got weight a little bit right my brother says it's it's right is it anarchist oh yeah yep aqueducts Easter Brady's gonna bring toys Wow I can't any be a toy teddy bear  currently starting my work for today I'm recording a podcast with someone later this evening not for my podcast but for hers and so she sent me an outline so I'm just kind of like breaking down the questions I don't always do this sometimes I kind of do things on the fly but these are a little bit more detail so I want to make sure I write out all the answers I want   it is 4:15 right now but I wanted to answer some questions in this vlog because I think it'll be more entertaining than me showing me on my laptop in my bed I just wired money for taxes so I'm feeling on fire right now if I get questions on this my jumpsuit is from Urban Outfitters by about eight years ago one of the only things that's in my closet right now and ask for questions on my Instagram but I actually asked for these a while ago and I asked for that like an Instagram Q a but I just didn't answer all them so I figured I'd go ahead and answer them here random but what computer do you have I have a 15-inch MacBook Pro and I bought the one that has like the highest processor and the highest storage it was the most expensive thing I think I've purchased I'm pretty sure but totally worth it for my job it's literally the only thing that I use for like editing bookkeeping like Gmail all those things it does a really good job and it served me well I've had it for I think two and a half years now just went through a bad breakup with a very toxic ex any helpful tips for moving on so I've been through one breakup for I didn't have like a toxic breakup situation it was very much like I just going different ways kind of breakup and so I think the situation might be a little bit different but as cheesy as it sounds like throw yourself into something new distractors so for me it was right before I moved for college so it was very easy when I went to college to kind of like distract myself and not think about it because I was in like a totally new place of light and also now I'm kind of just like a mutual understanding and having respect for each other but just like recognizing that it's a different phase of life that we're in and that's totally okay I just think that breakups are made out to be like this like traumatic thing and they definitely can be I think it's a part of life and it's a part of growing as a person and it's not something to be ashamed about idea of a perfect date oh my goodness I miss going on like actual dates I can't even tell you I think some of my favorite dates in New York City that I've been on I love like picnic dates I love like making a cute little lunch or dinner and going to the park with a blanket and like looking at the skyline I really love summers in New York City eating outside like having a glass of Rose a and like walking around a lot and going to the pier I also really like cooking it's so much fun to like cook with your boyfriend or girlfriend and make like a nice meal and enjoy it together my perfect dates always end with dessert one of the things I miss the most right now about the city is Van Leeuwen ice cream because they have this churro dairy-free ice cream and it's so so so so so good it tastes like every beautiful thing in the world and it's delicious I would either end with that or levain cookies which I eat living cookies literally twice a week in New York City because they're so good how did you handle anxiety when you were moving to New York City on your own I can't this question all the time and the funny thing is when I moved to New York City that was why I was the least anxious in my life I was so ready for something new just felt so prepared and had met friends right when I moved there and it was like one of the most fun parts of my life that was a time when I was really falling in love with Eden and it was just such a beautiful time of my life and the thing is it's like the first time in my life and this is kind of sad to recognize but it was the first time in my life where I truly did not feel stressed did not feel anxious did it have like a worry in the world I'm just so carefree it's so beautiful to think about but I think it's kind of like the answer to going through a breakup you just got to throw yourself into things throw yourself into new things really distract yourself hang out with people I hung out with so many random people who I am like not friends with right now but at the time like it was fun to spend time with them and they're like be in that phase of life honestly how are you I feel this is such an important question to ask everyone how are you I am doing a lot better than I think I was a couple weeks ago I almost feel like there is a lot of negativity online right now you feel guilty for being positive unlike there are serious things going on and so I'm finding it difficult to strike a balance between and knowledge and everything that's going on in the world but also trying to be like positive light in people's lives we are all trapped in a house together and like everyone's on their phones they're on Instagram they're on YouTube they're on all these things and they're just like going at it and it's like we all have cabin fever and we're like grumpy and in a bad mood and going too fast from social media on Friday because Good Friday just in celebrating Easter and fasting is a principle that a lot of people do and instead of fasting from food I think I'm going too fast for my phone because I think that's the thing that really tempts me and makes me feel the most anxious is this thing right here and I think I might do it next week - I have some sponsorship stuff I need to finish up - like post on Instagram and do all that stuff this weekend but next week I don't really have a lot of stuff that like needs to go on Instagram and so I'm just at a place where I kind of want to have a week like creating YouTube videos and working on content but not scrolling through Instagram why don't you use your vlog channel anymore Michelle out of your shell so I used to have a vlog channel but because I do post vlogs on this channel Niall there's not really a point to keeping up with two channels and just like from a business perspective I learned that having two channels wasn't super smart for me personally and I'd rather post more on this one instead of posting between - well your house plants in New York City died since you aren't there so we haven't watered them for I've been home for a month my roommate Rose just texted our neighbor and asked if he would water them so they will likely be Larry dead but my fiddle leaf has a tendency to survive for a month and so I think it'll be okay but he's gonna want them for us which is so nice he's like such a great neighbor is Texas on lockdown so I don't believe the whole state of Texas is on lockdown but my County specifically that I live in does have a stay-at-home order when will your podcast be out so this is a question that I've talked about originally the podcast was supposed to go live the week of March 17th that was when I planned but that was really I would say the pivotal moment in the u.s. when things really started to take a turn and you know people started getting laid off people started getting really sick things just started spreading and podcast for reference really about kind of post-grad life going through changes that you have in your 20s so like getting a job networking I interviewed a lot of my old professors on ago shading your first salary as a woman and how to network I can get the job you want and I interview the founder of Co party about like starting a business while also raising kids and having a conversation trying to draw out their story that's a you know that's a soft skill thing but that's what makes this valuable not the fact that you know how to do it again I think it's it's really important to know that people aren't going to just throw money at you my entire career once I have gotten a bonus that I did not expect that I didn't have to ask for by saying I am so grateful that I had the choice and opportunity to stay home for 12 years it was a huge gift and by the way it's the hardest job on earth and sometimes it feels thankless but the reward is I think the bond and you know the respect that I was able to build with my three kids all these things that personally I was really interested in that I felt like was missing in the podcast being very applicable for people who are like 22 23 24 whatever it didn't seem like it was the most applicable time to post when you can't interview for jobs when you can't network when people aren't even like going to their college classes right now except online it just didn't seem like it really made sense and so I made a decision not to watch it then I have about eight episodes that are pre-recorded that I did and so all these episodes have already been recorded with guests I worked on it a lot in February specifically but I've gotten so many questions about it and so many people on Instagram told me that by it being about those subjects it's a great distraction and it's a great time to post it you know it makes a lot of sense right now to post it because people are really searching for things and you know eventually like people are gonna be applying and eventually you know people will be interviewing people will be graduating and things will go back to normal we just don't really know when and so it would still be applicable and so I believe I am still going to launch this within the next two weeks it's what I'm planning I need to re-record a lot of the intros and a lot of the solo episodes just to kind of give disclaimer those episodes are recorded beforehand those are other questions I'm going to answer because I'm about to record this podcast at five I just try to do even if it is you know a blog that's pretty simple I still try to make sure there's some sort of theme or message or even just it's very peaceful to watch it makes you'll feel comforted
