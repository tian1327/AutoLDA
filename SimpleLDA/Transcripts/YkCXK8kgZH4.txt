 hello ladies and gentlemen it is your house you put the most whiteboy7thst from apex legends where a guy and one of these masks will come over somebody's wounded body and it's always from the wounded bodies perspective you know there's a little blood on the camera or whatever your hands like this and then they come and like they stomp on you with their gas masks and a big-ass boot and the man your life anyways I also have this mask I found this on seventh Street in the Attic when I was cleaning it out and I kept it I don't know if this is for scuba diving or for what but this is like I don't know polio is dormant in there so let's just put that down put the hand sanitizer out and move on so anyways guys I hope everyone's holding up alright this is a quarantine update vlog I think it's the start of week two Illinois just put in a mandatory like stay at home or recommendation I don't know starting as of yesterday only essential businesses are remaining open and I'm glad they're doing this a little bit early it seems like compared to other Sates it seems like more of a safe than sorry type of approach because the outbreaks not too big here compared to like New York or California but maybe there just needs to be more tests done and there be a lot more infected here but anyways yeah basically only gas stations hospitals pharmacies and grocery stores are remaining open I think restaurants if you can go through the drive-thru they did say an essential business was I wanna grow facilities and I know my dispensary that I goes to is staying open but I did go there I didn't have my mask on not the full-on like next time I go out I'm wearing like a big boy mask I don't know if this is like for like it is a prop or maybe it is actually useful I'm not sure but I don't believe at these people who say oh masks are not effective like but then why do they the health care people need it so bad like my perspective like I don't want it like I wash my hands a lot now but I just don't want to inhale it I feel like that's something I can't really control I could try to inhale like this and this was low-key I just wanted to itch my nose but I didn't want to set a bad example and touch my face on camera but anyways like if I need to itch my nose I have my hat and then I like I'll H it with my hat and I don't know if that's any good or anything but I still do it anyways oh my my face has never been itchy ur then over the last few weeks but yeah it's just really weird seeing the bread empty the milk out of you know stock by the way you can freeze milk for up to three months I've learned that recently and Oh big update horrible update bad news we're out of cookies I hate all of the cookies I ate all the ice cream I don't base achill II all the snacks and this has been a bad thing to do because then I'm looking online and these doctors like to different actors recommend you take this time to eat healthy stop smoking stop drinking because those things you know eating bad smoking drinking they compromise your immune system and what you want right now is your immune system to be at its peak performance level because they don't really have a drug to cure the coronavirus they don't got a vaccine that's a long time away apparently there's a few different combinations of like a malaria drug called like chloroform or in that chloroform but like something like that and then some other drug you combine those two in it it's very helpful for those struggling but I think the main you know that your first line of defense and your best bet is to have a good healthy immune system so you want to eat up on your fruits your vegetables get all those nutrients I've been personally drinking it they're expensive expensive but they're like right next to the the vegetables in the and they're in the grocery store they're like these bottles of you know it has eight apples in it and three bananas and I'll show you I don't know I can't sometimes it's just hard for me to describe things that were I'd try to describe it like I could just say a bottle of juice that has a lot like a lot of fruit uh-huh but I don't through this like it's by the fruit section I don't know I'm just weird I don't know if I have any oh here it goes it's back in here don't spill it okay they took out the this they didn't have the seed boost one so I got amazing mango you know it has just a bunch of fruit in here they taste really good and it has a lot of vitamins I've been just drinking a little bit more of those taking my vitamins anyways I saw somewhere online I don't know if this is fake news I don't want to be spreading fake news someone said take as much vitamin C as you can until you start having diarrhea I don't think that's good advice but yeah I would take a little bit maybe not that much vitamin C but take as much just do whatever to make yourself feel better I don't know that's why I like doing I like even having the masks in the dispensary I feel like before the oh this guy's weird but like this made me feel better you know and it probably protect him a little bit so yeah I think my immune system is fine can we do a high school story about immune systems um oh is I'm really high school story with okay this is modern warfare 3 times they did the first ever like gaming event it seemed like Cod XP like Eminem was supposed to perform I think Kanye ended up performing Eminem ditched but like so we go to LA there's thousands of people there we're all playing call of duty modern warfare for the first time and they have these stations right so it's like octagon of eight you know TVs connected 8 X boxes and then you know 8 controllers so there's maybe 10 of those stations I'm not sure for like 10,000 people so everyone is touching these same controllers right and everybody wants a handshake I mean this is months after I got the world's fastest new pretty big deal at the time so everyone's you know trying to shake my hands and I got so  sick I've never been that sick in my life I was really damn sick dude but I survived that I didn't go to the hospital I was there someone else who probably got the same sickness he had to go to the hospital I was just sitting smoking a bowl basically that was my medicine I just like I had remember having like an ounce and I just like through two weeks just going through the answers being deathly sick but I for some reason I was still smoking I was so stupid I probably should have just healed up but that was my medicine as people saying give me medicine stupid but yeah I got these actually I brought these out I got some seeds there emergency survival Seed Vault which I always kind of wanted to have a garden and maybe this is the year when's the time the plant I think it's about time to plant right now all right we have this we have this like indoor grow thing which has like spices and herbs and stuff nothing like major like tomatoes but you can get a bigger version but this is the bigger version it's just so quiet so quiet there's a few cars over there but and then until Luna yaps oh no you know she usually she gets excited and in naps you can see how dirty it was like I was playing with her there's all those uh skid marks from her just sprinting and then stopping at it on a dime and then just a wreck and a little the lawn but that's fine what else was I gotta say oh yeah about outside I think it would be very interesting to see I hope they do studies of this because we're basically shutting down the economy for a week or two where's your frisbee where's your frisbee go go get the frisbee it'll be interesting to see um the environmental difference or if there's a change in temperature for example when 9/11 happened and they shut down complete air traffic for what it was three days or something like that three weeks it was three or something I'm not sure but anyways I think global temperatures dropped like 1.1 or something changed when the 911 happened because of the reduced air traffic so I'm wondering what the impact will be hopefully like hopefully this changes a lot of people's perspective on on life and like I don't know like before people just like walk past you not give a  about you don't care like you're just another number and you the same to them it was just like I don't know maybe this will change people's perspective like I'm like it's so weird we can just shut down everything but they're just gonna give free money out like it's a lot of funny money I've been talking about this funny money but it's all coming it's all coming down anyways stay indoors stay safe wash your hands social distancing you can still hit that like button but wash your hands before you click that like but but then try to be healthy now I'm gonna do some push-ups right now  it let's do some push-ups okay my floor is a little dirty all right how many pushups should we do how many can we do I don't know I remember doing push-ups for football in high school and I was doing the best I could but then like at a point you physically can't do push-ups oh my coach yelled at me for not being able to do any more push-ups I was like bro I can't do anymore what do you mean okay every morning I was gonna no bread I'm saying what else I think that's about it for this quarantine vlog Illinois when I'm locked down I don't think much changes you can still walk your dog I don't know if I said this because I did this vlog twice before but I deleted it I still been walking my dog I just been using my boots see they got a little dirty I just been walking her through the grass off the beaten path just to stay you know as far away from people as possible because the virus can I don't think it infects dogs but their nose is a perfect petri dish you want to play you want to play so bad go go go go go see there's here whining go go go don't mean I throw it first okay what's your issue Linda I don't know yeah that's the main victim of the quarantine is Luna and wasn't really Krista quarantine it was raining the last few days so I didn't want to play play it as much with her but yesterday I said man she needs to get some good play time and she got so
