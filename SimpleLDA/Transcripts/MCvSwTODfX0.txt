was an accident but I'd rather show you then tell you just remember it was an accident I ate all of the pizza except one that is so bad in better news after I came from Domino's I forgot to go and get marinara sauce but I knew Domino's was more likely going to charge me for it but that was a piece of real next door and I went in there and I try to be slick like leave my Domino's box at the beginning of the counter while I went in the back to where the cashier was to ask for a container of marinara sauce oh but it called me out he was like let me ask you something why would you bring a Domino's Pizza box in here to come in here and explore a real marinara sauce and I'm just like I didn't even see you here at first pretty much at the end of him calling me out he gave me a free slice of pizza and a container of marinara sauce bad news is I really didn't need that slice of face good news is it'll be left over for tomorrow the pizza is my last craving my last fix of junk food
