 I look like I haven't even slept either  hey guys it's good morning so today's video is gonna be different as you can tell I am trying to incorporate different things inside my channel because I just don't want it to be all storytimes like I want to have a variety of content for you guys to watch so I thought I'd bring you guys along today I woke up like maybe 15-20 minutes ago I have to go outside I have some things that has to get done so I thought I'd bring you along and show you what my side of New York City looks like because I find the people who mentioned New York City they're only in Manhattan or in Brooklyn and that's like really not the only New York City there's also the Bronx there's also uptown there's Queens there's not an island so yeah I look like this because once I get back from being outside I automatically have to take a shower I just I can't be with like the outside on me or anything so I'm gonna take a shower when I get back I'm gonna wash my hair I'm gonna do some makeup and I have to do all of those well I gotta do we gotta go we gotta go right now I have to put on my going outside clothes basically which consists of gloves I don't eyeball up but they're from Paraguay I guess I was wrong I'm sorry guys my camera stopped recording um this is just outfit that I like to wear to go outside these are like my going outside quotes I have some eyes because CBS doesn't let people go inside without a mask I literally put my shoes on like the shoes that I wear to go outside I literally put them on like at the ledge of my house because I'm just crazy like that okay I'm just gonna be honest I call me what you want a fool you I just came back from Syria the line was long and it's like 9 o'clock they need a like calm down take it easy I got the Maui moisture healing hydrate shea butter hair mask for dry damaged hair I know I don't have dry damaged hair but I just like all of the nourishment to go into my hair after like a week of it you know being out and then I got the Marc Anthony chakra curls 71 leave-in treatment foam I literally feel like this is a dupe for the caviar one that's like fifty seven dollars or something like that definitely check this one out if you like mousse I love mousse I feel like it just gives like volume definition but less ability blah and I really like this one so I'm gonna take a shower as fast as I can at ten o'clock I have to order some sneakers so let's just go take a shower okay guys so I literally just like rushed out the shower I washed my hair normally I put my hair mask while I'm in this shower but since I have to do this thing here at ten o'clock I am doing it now so I'm gonna take that much wow this  oh my god it just smells amazing I don't really ever talk about sense of things but this smells really good sorry if I keep looking down is that I'm looking at all my phone my laptop and my iPad to make sure that I have it's not my turn yet but normally with product I never ever put a lot because I don't want to wait on my hair but since this is a hair mask I like to put a lot especially since I haven't I haven't put a hair mask in my hair in like two washes No yeah - why not one wash wash I'm just gonna take a little bit more crumb I literally like my hot the shower dried myself put on my robe and I came over here just to make sure that all the product is distributed I'm really scared to like run and wash my hands because what if it's my turn um so I normally put a cap on my hair but I'm not trying to sit here camera like with a cap on for the whole time so I'm just gonna take my hair up so that my roots are up and then just you know I'm going to now do my skincare I already washed my face since it was like in the bathroom so I'm just not gonna take the Dickinson witch hazel amazing if you get like pimples and stuff like I don't know my face is breaking around cuz ya know if you know you know so I just take a little cotton round and I soak it and I work in circles my face gets red from anything is so sensitive so don't be alone you don't forget your neck people and let that dry by itself I don't like to tie well this one looks crazy so now I'm gonna go in with the self-made care healing butter it's literally like a whipped texture and then I give dissolves into like I don't know I want to see like a like a butter no like a cream sorry so I take a little bit I doubt that always up I just love how it feels like on my cheekbones when I go like this she's like I'm at a spa and whatever is left over I put it in my hand since my hands are drier than the Sahara Desert like my hands are like sandpaper put some on my elbows what I like about this product though also is that you can like use it for both your face and your body and I just take some out before put it on my lips yeah that is my own skincare routine I usually put on an eye cream but I don't have anymore and Sephora is taking forever to bring me my eye cream I didn't show you guys but I used the shade Moisture lush length shampoo and conditioner with cannabis sativa hemp seed oil this was my first time using it I felt like it was good left my hair feeling soft but not like oily I don't like that okay guys so I just finished rinsing out the leave-in I'm now gonna go in with the curl talk refining cream from not your mother's I'm just taking a little bit since the mousse is a leave-in treatment it pretty much has everything that you will need for your hair all-in-one I also rinsed it out with cold water like literal cold water not the Evo or warm I should say cold cold water okay now I'm gonna go in with the Marc Anthony strictly curls perfect girl seven in one leave-in treatment foam I would be the type to like boom hit my head so I got a I'm clumsy like that I don't know it's my pump is up but the last time I had this it wasn't like this it's not even like guys I think about the wrong one it's not like that was definitely too much I think all of Marc Anthony's products smell really good it has that like upper Westside salon where you have to make an appointment 5 months in advance kind of smell so just like a little quick tip if you are an air dryer like me I always have a window open so that my hair isn't getting frizzy because of like air in my house so I always practical window open just a little tiny bit okay I bought a light I got this stand for it everything and then I have this the adapter is supposed to go in the back and I don't know it's not working and I'm not sure Oh maybe oh nevermind it is you just gotta press a little harder I'm gonna do like a quick little makeup with you guys a lot of people have been asking me to do like a tutorial but I don't feel like there's enough people I'm just not trying to saturate YouTube with more makeup content I feel like there's so many creators there's so many people doing makeup I'm not trying to be like another one so I'm just gonna close to do what I normally do so if I'm doing my makeup and I'm just gonna like me at home or like take pictures and stuff I don't mind just using the moisturizer that I already have on as like my primer I'm gonna go in with some spray what are you my Beauty Blender this is a cover FX do we finish setting spray I'm gonna go in with the milk makeup blur liquid I love this foundation it's like my favorite it looks crazy at first wow I'm literally about to do my makeup with the okay what the viewfinder I don't think there's anything left in this anymore wow that's it it's done this is like a beautiful dewy natural finish foundation which I love that's like my personal favorite kind of finish when I put it on it looks like it's orange I look like an oompa loompa but after it like sets in after like 10 15 minutes we're good I look like an oompa loompa look like Donald Trump literally y'all this late though it's not a thousand so yeah just make sure that you blend you see that like highlight it looks like my face is literally wet it's a combination of my moisturizer and this foundation this foundation doesn't give you like a super wet finish but it does give you a nice little base to work with y'all see this this right here looks crazy but you'll see in like 20 minutes it'll work it'll work it'll work have faith I'm gonna put my concealer on I'm going it with the Born This Way monster you sculpting concealer by Too Faced this is full coverage but it's a nice full coverage just like lettuce sitting while I do my eyebrows and honestly I'm not gonna show you how I do my eyebrows because sometimes it takes me too long so yeah I'll be back so I finished my eyebrows sort of kind of I'm like really annoyed with them today it's just not even I'm just putting in some brow gel like my eyebrows they don't even like their sisters like they don't even look like they're friends they look like they hate each other actually it's because I haven't them eyebrows in like 90 freakin months you know like how you just have like those days where your brows are just horrible that's my day today don't come at me from in the comments because I don't really care I feel like brows are so important because they like shape your face so like you see right now like my face not looks like mm it's just gonna have to do for today you're gonna go back in with my beauty blender and blend out my concealer I like to let this concealer sit a little bit and dry it down because I get the most pigment when it's like that I'm bringing this concealer like pretty low so that like my face is in the car coming down below what's your favorite like all-time favorite thing to do when you're doing any good mine is always always bronzer I love bronzer I like concealer too but not as much as I like bronzer by the way a little funny story I didn't know how to use translucent powder or like setting powder I didn't know how to use setting powder I didn't know how people got the powder out of the thing until I saw I don't remember exactly who and they like put it in the cap I was like oh that makes sense that makes San mamés got brass key and peopled raspbian I also take some and put them on my smile lines I'm gonna take the color pop no filter concealer in like a darker shade and I'm going to bronze contour sort of this concealer actually matches me when I am tend like during the summer time but so a little trick I'm just in case like you don't know when you're putting on bronzer instead of you going like that it's better I like so apparently I don't know how to use my words but I'm trying to say smile instead of tugging at your face that way you can get your actual placement I still like where you want it to be but now I can actually see how it's going to look when I smile and I know exactly where to take it down to because when you go like this you can't really see exactly where you're gonna push it down to but if you go like this you can see I don't know if that makes sense just try it if you normally contour and bronze like this try like this and you'll see a really big difference I'm putting on more bronzer like my faces and look like I don't believe already like I'm in Miami right now I just love bronzer like I just love bronzer I love cross there's so much I'm gonna use this shade right here since I'm light as Hale I don't put I don't pick up too much of this I just like dip my powder like a little tiny bit like a little tiny bit a little bit and now you're probably looking at me like what the you gonna do with your eyelid I got you sometimes I'll use the same brush that I use for my bronzer for my collage I'm going in with the Milani Luminoso I pick up a lot of blush I like a lot of blush I don't know why I used to never wear blush actually until I found like the colors that I like and I just pile on blush now blush is always like the first thing to leave from your face anyway so it doesn't really matter how much you put on right now if they got across my nose a little so I could look like Rudolph this blush has like it has like a sheen to it and it just it gives you like the prettiest little highlight I don't wear highlight sometimes I can be bothered with highlight so yeah I'm just gonna go back in and blend everything when I feel like I put on too too too much I will take the translucent powder and I'll clean it up like this and so yeah that just helps to like clean everything make everything look nice now basically like seconds elapsed up if I'm not trying to do nothing crazy or whatever I would just put on some like liner sort of but with powder I don't use liquid liner so I'm gonna go with the dose of colors does he and Katie Frank Asian palette I love this palette like this is like my favorite I have a thousand pilots I'm not even gonna lie but I just keep coming back to this one because it's just so good like look at these shades so beautiful I'm gonna go in with the dark chocolate brown okay I'm gonna go in like at the end and I'm just like stamping it on my eyelid so do you make a mistake and it looks stupid you take like a nice Wow bro my favorite shade I'm gonna take this one that's a little bit lighter more of my skin tone color and I'm just gonna buff it in and like blend it I just want to give you guys like a tip that I see a lot of people who are starting with doing like their eye shadow and stuff don't hold the brush up try to hold it down or like straight ahead when you're doing it make sure that you're not putting like I shot on like the inner tear-duct of your eye because it just makes your face look more like to gathering you look like a raccoon if you are putting eyeshadow all the way up here and you don't like the way it looks you can take either color and just like clean it up a small brush like this just clean it up on the top now I am going to take my eyelash curler I never used to use one until I used it one day and I saw like how voluminous my eye my eyelashes were I was like oh okay I can see the height my eyelashes are already pretty long so this doesn't really make that much of a difference for like length it just like picks them up as soon as I finished curling my lashes I go straight in with mascara this is the better than sex on mascara by Too Faced and I just put like a little tiny bit of mascara on my bottom lashes I'm just gonna take a brush that's the way any residual powder I have so now my face is done I am going I usually always cut off setting spray before I put on my mascara but I just forgot because since my eyeshadow broke I am I'm losing it my mind is going a little bit nuts right now so I'm just gonna cover my eyes with this oh my god I always sneeze every time I do my makeup I always sneeze it's like a ritual I'm just gonna go in with my lip on outline my lips I'm using the damn boss X colors by Cora lip liner in the color cafe hold the lecher yeah if you are tan and every single lip liner you use makes you look ashy or makes you look like your lips are not even there you should definitely get this it might be sold out but I think there is stopping it this color right here is like the perfect brownish nude especially if you're like a similar skin tone to me and I'm just gonna put a gloss right over it this is I think pretty yeah this is from the same collection oh it's cop really this is like the juiciest lip gloss in the world I have the fancy ones and this one is like that  yep and that's the finished look I am going to wait for my hair to finish air drying but bro do you see this like definition I think it's the mousse so yeah I'm just gonna finish your drying my hair I'll be back to show you guys how it looks Oh before I leave let me show you guys my little outfit of the day shirt is from Anthropologie and these are just some Sara jeans they're their mom jeans they fit really nice and I love like where they come up to I'm not much of a like all the way skinny down kind of girl anymore and these holes oh my god hey guys okay I took you know the  advice that everybody's always telling me hey you want some more volume in the room clip it clip it in look at this I'm gonna show you guys how to fix this if you are a person with thin hair or fine hair and this happens to you for listening to other  people take your water bottle like I said this is just water okay so just pick it up from the well I have really good definition I don't know if you guys can see it that moves really gave me good definition also though the curl cream it does give good definition itself otherwise like it came out really nice but you guys know my hair is blue so just pick it up from the bottom spritz some water on it put it back down lay it down you know now we got this piece enter a meaty okay so quiero poner el otro la bunch of business bro just mind your business and there we go voila it's a little wet now but it's gonna dry and it's gonna be cute today was one of those days where I wanted more definition than volume if you have that problem that I do had with the clips what you should do is maybe buy the smaller ones I don't have the smaller ones because I don't really care about volume in my roots I just like once my hair is dry I shake it out and it gives me the amount of volume that I need but you can get the smaller ones and like clip it like this and then when it's done drying just take it off and then it'll be a little bit bigger at the top so when this part dries I will shake it out with a little tiny bit of oil I didn't put the oil before my hair dried because the mousse has like so many so many elements to it that putting in the oil was just like cause it's a clash so I'm gonna put the oil once this little mumbo jumbo is done drying a little update I am going to be posting my story times on Friday on Tuesdays I am going to be dropping content like this like vlogs styling clothes makeup stuff hair stuff like stuff like on Tuesdays because I don't want my whole entire channels to just be devoted to story times I actually enjoy talking to you guys and letting you see what I do in a day sort of slow motion for you slow okay guys so my hair is finally a hundred percent dry I got caught up doing a couple of other things I am obsessed with the way came out like it's super defined and like bouncy I don't I really like it I feel like my actual texture is coming back like this is
