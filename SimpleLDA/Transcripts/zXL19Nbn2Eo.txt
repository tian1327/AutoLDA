 so I've been holed up in my apartment for a month now that's a long time but I checked before I started recording this video and as of today which is March 31st there are 300 thousand cases of corona virus or kovat 19 worldwide which I uploaded while I made last week when I made my first chronolog coronavirus vlog there was like a hundred and fifty thousand and it's doubled in the week so that's pretty crazy I also saw really quick when I Google current of hours just to kind of get an update because I feel like it changes so much and I didn't want to like search the information yesterday or the day before and just have outdated information because things are changing all the time so kind of what my plan is that as long as this thing is going on I'm going to be like throughout the week I will take screenshots of things that I think are like noteworthy or things that are interesting to me and then I'll be inserting clips and talking about them wanted to make sure that I had is up-to-date information as I had because I'm gonna try and I'm going to try and edit this tomorrow but I mean I think just as soon as you put something out there there's new information or the information you have is outdated so I also saw that there's information going around that this was a virus that got out of a lab and I read an article I said that that's a myth that this is actually a natural occurring virus that they looked at it and basically I guess scientists are able to look at a virus and they can tell if it was engineered I guess cause like they kind of like I'm not a scientist but it seems they copy part of another virus to create a new virus but this didn't have that and so it wasn't human made or man-made it was engineered was naturally occurring and so their theory is that it came from a bat and then from the bat it was transferred to an intermediate animal called a Pangolin which I google because I know what that was and it's basically an anteater I also saw this really sad story of a 39 year old that their King died from coronavirus I say they're thinking that because she had slumped symptoms that were like flu-like that could have been kovat 19 but when she went in they told her that they had like five tests left and they said that she was a little risk for it the disease then she started having trouble with her lungs and then shortly after they found her dead in her kitchen and so her partner wanted to make sure that everybody kind of understands cuz I think that people are especially people that are younger because they initially reported that it was you know mainly fatal to the elderly population and so you know nursing homes and things like that were kind of on lockdown but it is affecting younger more and more younger people are being hospitalized for it and so they're kind of starting to look at it differently now where it's not just the elderly that are being seriously affected by it and being killed by it and I think pretty much everywhere in the country has declared a state of emergency basically I have a note here that Florida last week declared a state of emergency because that's where I'm from that's where my family lives they I think the first outbreak I don't know if the first outbreak in Florida was a scam B County but I used to live in Escambia County which is where Pensacola is I saw that Carnival Cruises was using their ships for non kovat 19 patients basically to free up the land hospitals so that they could see more than Cove it 19 people you know because people are still getting sick from other things are injured and they have to be seen but the hospitals are overwhelmed and have enough supply of staff or equipment and it has been quite a task to find toilet paper and baby wipes and infant tylenol because my baby is currently teething she's seven month old about to be eight months old and she's getting her two top two front teeth and I was low on infantile and all and I actually found it in stock that I could order online from Walgreens and then we found a commercial supply company that we could get the toilet paper from so we have this big like box an 80 count of Scott toilet paper and then honest company had wipes still I do not like honest company diapers and luckily I don't need diapers yet I should probably get some though pretty soon honest diapers are absolute crap but if there was nothing else I would just have to get honest diapers again because I'm so thankful that they were in stock at least I didn't check with diapers but at least with wipes I was so thankful for that I still had some wipes but I just feel like with the way that things are going that I shouldn't replenish my stock because I never know when things are gonna be sold out and I do not want to be without wipes with this baby so I've got some celebrity stories that I think were interesting some what summer summer funny others are kind of infuriating and others are kind of sad because you know these are people that have gotten the corona virus but as most people probably know Jared Leto was in a he had come out of a meditation retreat I don't know if it was with his band or with friends or whatever but he had been in a meditation retreat for 12 days or something like that and he came out to the world ending basically he's like I had no idea coronavirus was happening like I went in to my meditation retreat and came out to a different world and that is  hilarious and then you know what you're seeing is like some people are kind of keeping a sense of humor about the situation but also understanding that it's serious other people are freaking out and hoarding things over buying things and causing this this shortage of supplies which doesn't need to happen a couple of celebrities that I read about that tested positive for enterovirus idris elba which is a pretty famous actor he tested positive with no symptoms and he he got tested because he was in contact with someone who was known to have kovat 19:00 I'm sure because of his you know celebrity and money probably he was able to do that but from my understanding just the average person unless you have symptoms you will not be tested for it because they don't have enough tests to go around and so they want to save it for people that are actually having the symptoms and in danger of dying or at least getting very seriously ill because when you have a disease of the lungs I mean if you can't breathing that is very very serious so he had no symptoms Andy Cohen who is the host a Bravo host was having symptoms and tested positive for it I know he was operating a podcast or his show out of his house and it's funny because you're seeing that like celebrities who are having to stay home and aren't going to a set or aren't you know doing business as usual Instagram was lit up with celebrities like constantly going live and then of course on their regular Instagram feeds you know taking pictures and making sure they're showing awareness for people you know to stay home because there's still a lot of people in the country that aren't taking this seriously which is crazy me because when you look at the news and you see how serious it is I don't see how you can't take it seriously but there are people that definitely aren't and some of them are celebrities I'll get to that but my best friend had posted this video about these people on spring break and how they were definitely not practicing social distancing and they are basically drunk and hanging out with a bunch of strangers and I just thought it was the most magical thing I ever saw these are college students these are like supposedly educated people it was beautiful to watch like mmm that was like prime content right there but of course the ninja Vanessa Hudgens who was who did high school musical she made headlines about ignorant comments regarding coronavirus and basically sounded like a bimbo and was like what did she say basically just saying that the DS disease wasn't that serious and like people dying is like inevitable like totally inevitable you know and then she was live on Instagram and so people recorded it and immediately after she said it it appeared that she was like oh  like what'd I just say but the damage was already done and then she tried to issue an apology and say that her words were taken out of context but like they weren't but she was just trying to do damage control some people were saying she looked like she was drunk she could have been I mean if we're all staying home there's probably plenty of people getting drunk out there Evangeline Lilly also said that she didn't think that that it was just a respiratory flu which a respiratory flu sounds pretty serious to me I have asthma so I don't  around with that stuff that that her dad has cancer and she admitted that she herself is also immune immuno immune compromised or whatever the word is I don't know how so I don't really know what her health it concerns our issues are but I don't know if she has like direct contact with her dad or whatever because people are just kind of like wow like you should want to protect your dad like you should take this seriously and one of the things that she said was like she doesn't agree with all the control of the government is having with Shayan businesses and forcing people to force people off the streets and forcing people you know to adopt different behavior or telling them you know Wendell II were to leave whatever and how that can be a slippery slope and I can kind of get what she's saying like I don't want total control by the government either but I think in times like this it's um it's a fine line and at some point you do have to kind of crackdown to save people from themselves guess and because because of how fast the disease is spreading and how many people are dying from it it's it's like what do you do what is the best thing to do to try and get control of the thing and to keep it from getting worse and more people dying what is the answer to that I don't know and then another really funny headline that I saw I don't know if this celebrity have made this comment now or if it was just an older comment that she'd made that was brought back up because of all the hand washing news but Adrienne Bailon who was part of 3lw three-element three little women that was like semi big when I was a teenager but I guess more popularly the Cheetah Girls which I never saw she said that she doesn't wash her hands at home after she uses the bathroom because it's her house and she's not going anywhere  that is me SD they are doing vaccine trials and it's kind of like a race between countries to find the vaccine China the US and Italy I saw an article that China had lied and said that they had I don't know anything to be I don't know what is true and what is not I just know what I've heard and I'm like what I've read and like supposedly China hasn't been like truthful about the numbers of the cases that they've had with coronavirus but I that's just what I've heard but I did actually see an article that I took a screenshot of that said that they had taken a picture of one of their virologists and said that they were getting the first vaccine and then that was proven to be a fake because the picture was actually of the virologist before they had gone to WA and China so it was a fake but they're actually doing vaccine trials here in Seattle the first woman according this article that I read to get the vaccine was a 40 43 she was in her 40s 43 year old mother which i think i mean i don't think i mean i have a seven-month-old I don't think I would I don't know what could go wrong if you got it like I don't know what side effects like what could happen if you got an experimental vaccine but I wouldn't put myself at risk like that because I have like a young kid but I mean that's great I mean they I applied you know anybody that can do that to try and help people you know as a whole but that just kind of struck me I was like wow your your mom like hell I mean she's 43 so how kind her kids be I mean I guess I should have at 20 they're grown or the nearly grown but I thought that that was a very self-sacrificing and a good thing but it gave me pause I was like I mean my mindset totally changed whenever I had a kid because before I had a kid it was like well you take more risks but I feel like I'm risk-averse even more than I ever was because now I have a kid but it needed to be tested and I'm glad that that there are people out there that will step up and do it so good for her and I think we should probably all be thankful to her I know that schools were a big concern you know like all this has gone on around Spring Break and so people were staying there Spring Break some schools were more equipped to do online learning than others some I know back in Florida they were talking about basically not having school the rest of the year because they in school in early May so they would have only had like if they'd gone back in April they wouldn't have had that much time left so they were like okay do we go back at all and then if we do I was hearing that a reading that they were going to basically say no more grades and tests I guess but then I think that that wasn't really satisfactory and so the county where I used to live in Florida it's now changing that to saying that they're going to be doing online school for the rest of the school year and then of course the natural concern is there are still kids out there that don't have computers or Internet access and so they're actually going to be supplying computers they're going to be getting in touch with all the families individually to see what their needs are and making sure that everybody has access whether they need a computer they'll be provided one so I think that's really good they've also been doing seniors only shopping hours at stores because you know all these  people going in and getting into fights over products over buying products not leaving anything for anybody else and so they've done seniors only shopping especially back when the majority of the population that was being seriously affected and dying from the disease was the senior population so that was nice to see and then probably I don't know how if this is like common knowledge but I thought it was kind of interesting was coronavirus the word or the name Korona which comes from the Sun you know the the corona around the Sun it's called a corona virus because when you look at it it has a corona like on the outside like you would see on the Sun so I thought that was a cool little fact that I didn't know that I came across online I've been watching I've been catching up on new shows and watching I've been really into YouTube obviously I'm making YouTube videos they're really really fun to make and I have I have like a couple new people that I'm watching and then of course my old favorite so the show the new show that I've been watching is on the Travel Channel and Robert Englund who plays Freddy Krueger which I love Robert Englund and Nightmare on Elm Street is my favorite film series slash night run l straight-4 is my favorite film of all time laughs if you want to but it's true he is hosting a new show called I believe it's called true terror with Robert Englund and it is like I feel like feel like not a lot of people saw this one show in the 90s because it kind of aired sporadically but it was called beyond belief fact or fiction where they would tell five stories it was hosted by first hosted by James Brolin and then he left and then it was hosted by Jonathan Frakes and they would tell five stories and then some of them would be true and some of them would be false and you would have to guess and then at the end they would tell you which were true much or false and then unsolved mysteries which I think was more popular show obviously so this show with Robert Englund is kind of a mixture between the two so he hosts it and it's true scary stories from history but they're reenacted by actors and then historians and people that are like experts on whatever the story is will come in and provide commentary I think they've only aired one episode or at least I've only seen one episode and it's real good in it it's just a combination of like so many things that I love so I was really happy to see that and then some people that haven't watched on YouTube dr. Dre is a newer one but I've been watching her for a while been binge watching a lot of her vlogs but she's a dermatologist and she lives in Houston she's really quirky which I like and she gives a lot of really good dermatology dermatological advice gravy girl which I've been watching for a long time and then her best friend Kat sketches or his casts catch who lived in California is a makeup artist a working makeup artist moved to Houston to be closer to her and just to have I guess lower cost of living I just got into her and I really liked her personality and she's very good at makeup she's obviously I think she went to school for it and then she did it professionally in Hollywood Melissa Merck who was a Canadian she was in Vancouver which is only like a couple hours from Seattle I've been meaning to visit which I obviously can't visit right now Allegra Shaw who is another can she lives in Toronto though I've always been fascinated with Canada and Canadians I don't know why it's kind of like because it's like the US but it's not it's like us light I don't know but it's like similar but also different I don't know I've always been obsessed since I was a little kid I've been watching this this woman Erica house who lives in Colorado I actually I didn't never know her personally but she used to teach college and I actually took a class that she did in Pensacola and then she had an online blog for a while and now she makes floss tubes which is basically YouTube videos about cross-stitch so i watch her her videos are really calming to me because like she'll in the beginning of the video she'll talk about her family life like how things went during the week and then she'll show her projects and it's like even though I've never been in a cross-stitch and probably never will be it's really cool to watch somebody who's so passionate about something show their work and like just be so into it it's so detailed and so excited about it I mean I just even if I'm not interested in what they're doing in terms of doing it myself I like to watch it kind of like why I like to watch Food Network I don't like to cook but I like to watch other people cook basically also been watching kathleenlights who's a pretty big beauty youtuber and I've been kind of hearing they're watching candid mommy and I've been hate watching tick-tock so I've been seeing people posting tic TOCs on Instagram and I think what actually got me to download it was kathleenlights got an Instagram and she has some pretty hilarious tic TOCs so then I started getting into the world of tick-tock and seeing like the tick tock celebrities and it is absolutely it is disgusting how such little effort and something can make somebody so famous is like it's it boggles my mind but it's mildly entertaining but it it is pretty stupid that becomes really repetitive like there's a few dances that are going around that everybody does not only does everybody do them but these people that are famous for it will do it a million times you know with different people but it's like the same  it's like wow can you use something else now because I'm bored of this I also ordered so when I was pregnant I didn't do a pregnancy journal and I didn't do a baby book but now I'm kind of cuz I was like okay well I'm gonna do videos about it so I'll have that but I actually decided after the fact that I do want like an actual tangible like memento so I bought pregnancy journal after the fact and I'm real extra especially because like I'm only planning on having one kid and I have trouble making up my mind about like what one pregnancy journal or what one baby book so I'm gonna get multiple ones because it's kind of like crafty it's kind of like a journey I don't know whatever like I'm just gonna I just decided I'm going to be a real extra with motherhood and it is what it is and it brings me joy so who cares and then I also inspired by our current situation with being on house arrest because of kovat 19 I started getting I've always been interested in fact and in infectious diseases I think that it's pretty fascinating to learn about breakouts that have happened in history and so like here and there in the past I like just googled them and like looked up what I code and just read for fun about infectious diseases so I'm doing that again and I was just reading the Wikipedia about the Black Plague so I actually kind of want to do videos about because I'm kind of nerdy and I like science stuff and things like that and so I just kind of feel like I might do videos based off of like old infectious diseases just because that's something that I find interesting so I don't know if anybody else will I mean I I'm certain a lot of you will find that interesting but I just don't how many people would find my videos because I feel like not a lot of people really find my videos yet and I'm just doing this for fun and if men you know if not many people ever find them then at least it's just a fun thing for me to do but YouTube is definitely very saturated right now with all kinds of YouTube videos and especially I'm sure a lot of people are doing that little coronavirus vlogs so that is I think basically it let me just scan my notes again I've got my laptop here and my lap to keep myself on track because I'm very very forgetful and that is pretty much all I have for this week's Curren of love coronavirus vlog i'll probably just like I said as long as this thing goes on each week I'll if I have anything to say I'll do a new coronavirus vlog with the city in the background downtown Seattle and this is actually I hardly ever do videos during the daytime so this is a real treat but if you like these kind of vlogs give my video a thumbs up comment on how you're doing during house-arrest and subscribe so that you can find more of my videos when I upload them and I will see you in future videos I have such a backlog of old vlogs that I want to get up that I need to be editing so I'm kind of like trying to do a mix of catching up on those and then also these kind of standalone videos so thanks for watching
