 hey guys uh right now it's like 2:00 in the morning and I am packing all of my stuff because of this virus so I currently go to school in New York my college is out here um but as you know this crazy virus is going through New York pretty badly right now so our College got shut down and they gave us approximately two days to move our wrap it up pick it up sis you don't gotta go home but you gotta get out of here so yeah now we're all scrambling packing and putting things in storage shipping things home just trying to get everything done last minute so that we can be safe and prepared and just away from campus so there have actually been two confirmed cases on our campus we just got word of that the past two days and that's kind of when well that's kind of the reason why we are all sent home now so yeah the two people who got it they weren't my major they didn't have any activities or like living close to me so I think I'm safe for now guys but we got to get out of here like I feel like everything's infected I washed my hands 20 times a day like every time I go outside I feel like I'm like suffocating just because of how crazy this all is so I'm gonna bring you guys along with me for the next couple of days well really just the next day because I want to show you what it's like to travel during this insane so I've been looking up like different articles about it and I've been reading like the safest seat to sit on in an airplane the safest best to wear mask to not like I've been doing my research so hopefully I can have a smooth and healthy flight home I wish you all the same if you're traveling anywhere in the next couple of weeks maybe months I hope you're really safe and stay healthy so yeah come join me on this college life of just always being on the move super late notice just stress so I'm up I'm probably gonna make an iced coffee or something because look at my suitcase hold on look these are empty I need to pack I need to pack that suitcase so we need to keep going     just made this with oat milk oh my god right now I'm in that word going to bear wine so I should arrive around 1 o'clock my flights at 3:45 ish so I should have enough time to get for everything simple it stopped up FedEx to ship that huge box don't seem right it's like oh my god I'm so sorry but yeah that's  so I arrived at the airport there are so many people that have gloves on masks on od like everything fill out and yeah it's been a stressful it's really hot in here and heating up I'm like burning up and I have so much my hands to carry so it's kind of a struggle but we're making it through  update I'm currently mildly stranded in this Airport because the FAA has canceled all of the flight landing and returning and a bunch of areas including New York so right now just in the airport waiting I still have hope for my fight later so I'm not gonna leave or anything but that's the latest and greatest base was temporarily shut down this afternoon after an FAA air traffic controller trainee positive for coronavirus the trainee had not been to the air traffic control center in Ronkonkoma since Tuesday inbound flights were halted for about an hour as the center was cleaned the FAA says operations are back up and operating while it develops a plan to further clean and disinfect the affected areas so flight to Atlanta got approved okay so good news some flights are getting out on time yeah this is kind of crazy this whole back and forth we're all just like waiting but thankfully those two flights are getting out I really hope my flight to Nashville also gets all but we're just gonna have to wait and see because it's a little bit later so I actually have an hour to MyPlate and I've been really wanting to do the stick on nails guy stick on nails have really made a come up since you last saw them in like middle school and they were zebra squares of likes of like gum so I'm gonna put these on and I'm gonna show you guys how I do them I'm gonna show you guys the result and we're gonna see if they cute because I've been what I've been so obsessed with these I've been wearing them all the time I've never tied this style and it's like hot pink it's kind of fun so let's do   okay so we've never done the ones that come with these little sticker things so I'm gonna have to recheck the direction oh you can do either or you can either do a diffusive or glue I'll probably do glue just because I want to say on for a long time because these are uh thinking a copper shape copper these are a coffin shape snail I have to kind of like make my nails a little bit coffin shape   do you like that there press-ons literally of all they're so good they're so good okay I made a friend what's your name Felicia Felicia I'm mizuka in fact you see I it's it's so this clip cut here but me and Felicia were just talking about all things YouTube she actually wants to start her own channel so I hope to see that soon and then yeah we started taking some pictures had a little impromptu photo shoot it was really fun good quarantine Airport entertainment  so my flight ended up getting canceled and immune Felicia were literally the only two people in the airport at this point okay so update my flight is canceled all the flights here are now are canceled because someone in the control tower is that like airplanes have has the right ways so yeah no one could stay in the tower to control the airplane so now we are stranded here until the next day so the soonest flight thought they can get me on is tomorrow at 8 a.m. right now it's probably like 310 320 on Saturday so yeah it's crazy because literally my college let us know on Friday like on Friday they gave us a notice that we had to be out of the dorms by Sunday yet you make travel plans and look the flights are getting canceled that's just it's a crazy scenario too crazy position but you have to stay calm and just take things as they come I think I'm gonna stay with a friend tonight my actual older roommate I have a video with her you guys have met her you guys love you guys know and love Judy and you'll see some more for today because she's coming to get me so I'm so thankful for that I'll probably just spend the night with her and head back to the airport in the morning luckily everything worked out yeah things are kind of still up in the air but right now I'm going to put some hand sanitizer on go to Shake Shack eat some food and wait for my friend to get here from Long Island City to LaGuardia so some minor road bumps but we're still going strong so got this let's go get some cool you want a burger you know burger you want a fresh bag  you  so instead of a burger and fries I have a kind bar I've literally eaten kind bars all day today like that's what I thought to eat today kind bars  I literally just met Alam one of the guys who works here at the airport went to the same school as me for college and we just had a really cool conversation that was really cool to meet him like I feel like today hold on this mask is suffocating me I feel like today today has come with a lot of like issues a lot of things going wrong a lot of craziness but literally I made a friend randomly and I'm kind of shy in person like I don't be talking to people and I met someone from my like same college who can like help me in the future like that's amazing just like goes to show you that in this crisis right now we can still all come together and like we're kind of closer and we just really have a sense of community and it's amazing to see so I feel good at the airport day 2 let's see if we can get out of New York once again there's literally no one in the airport it's like there's 10 people here but ah yeah I'm not feeling too great this morning it feels super nauseous and yeah I'm not feeling good at all so hopefully this movie will help me alright     hey guys I'm back home safe and sound but this flight was actually the worst fight ever because he had so many lay overs I stopped in Chicago and Houston and in Phoenix before flying into Burbank so that was just like rough like being in the plane for that long but I made it when I got home my mom like made me take all my clothes off put him right in the laundry like she wouldn't even let me go in the house like I just immediately had to go up and shower which was a good precaution to take I guess put some footage here but yeah um now I've been quarantined for about two weeks now this video was filmed around March 20th and yeah I've just been home braiding my hair organizing my book show like I've just been doing things at home and also school at home so I will update you guys with more videos if you liked this video please give it a thumbs up and hit that subscribe button
