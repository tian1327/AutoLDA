 people is really outside y'all like people is really outside  hey y'all so I'm in my car I didn't vlog in a minute well mainly because there's no reason to vlog because where are we going what are we doing but but anyway I'm with Kobe say hi Cole he's over me it's hot today like really nice it's in the 70s like I'm even hot with this one sleeve that I got on so nosy anyways I'm about to take Kobe home well I'm gonna take him to the vet first since like the groomers is not open he needs his nails cut he needs a bath I gotta go to Petco yeah so we faked on a journey today not really so I'm like let me vlog even though we're in quarantine let me just give you our little vlog a vlog vlog right Kobe he said yeah he said yeah I just I'm about to drive and so actually my mask is I don't really think I need to wear my mask in my car but yeah so we bought the gig go all right so I'm outside of the um what do you call it his vet place so they don't allow us to like walk in so I'm going to call them my Apple watch it's like a drop off service you gotta call the outside they come outside pick up the pet anyway hi this is me call him back for Colby I'm outside with him okay no problem okay great thank you I love his vet they're just like so sweet and amazing what if I break his leash i dad don't think I brought Cody's leash Wow some cold pick so instead of going to Petco there's a pet shop right next to his vet um so I'm just going in and hopefully they have the shampoo that I need to get from Petco cuz that could just cut a whole trip and I would greatly appreciate that put my mask on and we're ready to go it really took seconds later see that's the store right there and they had it perfect perfect so now I'm just waiting for Colby to be done she should be done in a couple of minutes then I'm a driving home and yeah so why don't me to  me I might as well tell ya my dilemma it's not really a dilemma I'm just my curls dropped but it's okay I'm just torn because my birthday is a month away June fourth I'll be 25 so leading up to my birthday I wanted to do like a 25 days of Zay since I'm turning 25 so I wanted to do like posting every single day for 25 days until my 25th birthday however most of my posts were going to be blogs but there's nothing to blog because there's nowhere to go so oh this one is nice so I don't really know if I should still continue it actually I'm going to continue it but it's just going to be very challenging I'm not gonna lie because for the days that I'm home for the days that I'm home I'm going to like not gonna be doing anything so it's like what is there to vlog unless I'm posting content every single day like makeup hair this that so that was my fake little dilemma it's a little bummer but now that I talked about it it's not impossible it's not impossible to post content every single day I need your help comment down let me know what you should think I'm open to all what you should think let me know what you think I'm open to all suggestions yeah Oh sometimes and that also means that my 25th birthday will be spent in quarantine I was supposed to travel then I dubbed my international travel plans and I'm like you know let me do something local because things was opening up on a 15 but I think that's a dub as well so indoors indoors as how I miss them by 2050 so they brought Colby out to me and I just want to let y'all know that if you have a pet it's expensive to cut his nose already cost me $35 and that's only because and I only came here because Petco is closed while Petco is opened their grooming services are closed so they can't cut his nails for $10 but ear got the shampoo that I needed Colby how you feeling he over it yeah you get a bath today honey you know I'm up the tree he almost retreat and all fig up Kobe Cena's but Kobe big is going you see his best friend Wiz you like your towel Kobe like it yes oh it's so cute got it off Etsy so my mom is giving Kobe a bath right now I'm busy making me a sandwich I'm hungry it's like 240 always 140 hours alla hammer elbow people is really outside y'all like people is really outside enjoying the weather and this is why we're gonna be inside for another couple of months but it's man I so sad I can't even laugh like at least if you're gonna go outside wear a mask like we're mess oh yeah I'm about to enjoy my phases be Jiri
