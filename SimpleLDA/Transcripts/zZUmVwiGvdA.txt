actually the first day of my quarantine vlogs I decided to go ahead and film
frequently during the week just so you guys can see how I'm living during this
quarantine so without further ado let's get right into the video I'm uploading the
video today which is Monday but when you see this video the video will already be
posted so are we foreshadowing right now I'm currently adding all of
the descriptions to the clothes it's 11:10 and my video is getting to
publish in 50 minutes and I'm a little nervous but also really excited
because I know I put so much hard work into it working with videos I'd be back on
YouTube and they decided to be putting out better and improved content but I'm
tired so I'm gonna go to bed and wake up when it's 12:00 so I can plug myself on
this together I think now I mentor my light on the band I love to okay don't
like this I just wish it was silent I think that me room and I need content
not afraid to be an honest youtuber most people clean their rooms just for videos
I'm not hurt because I just came back so what I would clean in my room every week I'm changing my bag from here
I'm just saying ladies and even gentlemen like you just never stirred
creek the world hello you drew it

safe and to have a Taser on deck just like sat on my blog sure hello I'm gonna
put me on camera not necessarily oh hello hello

want anything I'm singing that same valid that whatever and I was like what
song is that and I figured it out it's from Drake and
Josh and it's like okay what do I face I'm sorry yeah a second book selfie would be mean fisheries she's cute and then I got this
dog on this mayweather them how that blouse is poppy I'm all aglow cool now I

dragon egg a they really rockin wanna bake because we're going at my mom's
room because she actually has a stand up mirror okay so this is from cotton are
different boo boo Amazon clips also from Amazon giving me they stay out of my
room black mom edition okay so we're gonna go ahead and go downstairs into
the pool area I need to take pictures am I getting in the pool - no because I
live in apartment complex and I think krumitz in the pool my mom likes to
think that gets to chlorine pool it's not there but yeah just make sure you're
staying safe like I've noticed that a lot of people have been just going
outside like disregarding all the sand a homeowner to California and elsewhere as
well but if you're outside just be safe in the day you're gonna do what you want
to do madam my buddy a summer Walker would say it's your mind your body let
mama take some pictures with you go ahead and do it lo - she likes it dude
oh my gosh a man is coming right now and I think he's a 4-pin it's just we all
greater than like sitting up my camera hi okay really think we can do that here
oh my gosh the park this little area where I'll figure out
where I can take some pictures maybe I can go sit on that tree oh okay
Wow I think I'm just gonna go ahead and just go inside from the best time being
outside I did take some pictures but it's very very very unlikely and I'm
highly that the pictures will actually turn out cute info swarthy you would
think living in California there be scenery everywhere but only in the
movies can we just get into how Zoey 101 was filmed at Pepperdine University
never green screen that right there should tell everyone who's not from
California including my video that you cannot trust California lighting
landscape scenery cuz its fake fortunately I couldn't go inside but I
would try taking pictures here and instead I'll use my bigger try but
instead so we'll get you on that I got some pictures I think there are some
that I'm gonna end up liking my camera's literally both die so I'm just gonna
have to start editing but I'll be back later when spy cameras charge so we
actually went to apology and I brought my camera
I brought my SD card I brought my tripod but I did not bring my battery that's
okay I'm gonna go ahead and eat and then go ahead and start editing the content
that I filmed today along with the pictures I took so once I think I'm
better term actually end up turning out really really nice stars go ahead and
show you guys those
