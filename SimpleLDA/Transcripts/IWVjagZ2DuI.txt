 Grande rising arises   I just don't know now we on our and know that cases are past 20,000 nationwide think 12,000 plus in New York I mean this coronaviruses like wild wild good news is I was able to fill out the unemployment application bad news is because as of about three days ago it is literally 200,000 plus registered applications oh my goodness I just don't know I don't know but I mean all wrong I'm still good I'm still doing okay which is why I'm making these daily vlogs for you guys doing these times and just let you guys get a look at this dumb  know what this window but anyways let me let you guys get a look at today's weather rainy dreary cloudy oh my gosh you know just what can you do what can you do plus it's cold today so definitely once again don't really know what I'm doing today though I know I do have things to do today but they are mostly inside and on the phone so I was editing this video of course you guys saw the last video and I was looking at this camera I was like no cameras actually in that bad to be a temporary situation of course I still have the new camera coming in I'm not gonna cancel it and it's really funny because I always said I wanted another camera but definitely was not thinking under these circumstances that I was gonna get another one how are you guys doing are you doing okay are you holding up pretty well I just turned on the news a little while ago I haven't actually been looking at the news in the past couple of days we're surprising because I've really been on it but just seeing these numbers rise man it's just crazy hopefully they do something about US citizens who are unemployed off work I know they aren't giving out the 1000 stimulus package and also there was 1,200 stimulus package and I'm I know for families or families or couples or something like that it was 2,400 but Manley's hopefully we get them checked soon oh yes sir  you want came over you bothering me what's going on yes mm I'm sorry you want oh he wants oh yeah you don't want me to move he just does not like whenever I move but I got a do work sir just dadgum Oh toasted um eggs on man I wish I had can't you guys oh it's crazy burnt my dadgum arm ah this about darling 50 cent worth of eggs and bacon mixed I was gonna do an omelet but I decided to just do some eggs cook some bacon crumble up the bacon in the eggs mix all look some cheese in it the Sam and then we have a pita pockets I had my dadgum earphone was only looking at missing corn on my phone I was putting the eggs and stuff in the pouch and looking lucky licking my hand landed on a skillet and then jumped up and did all this dump easily flying on the floor probably by the way man how come y'all didn't tell me my tag sticking out on my back yesterday Oh both be lookin out boss sister huh oh you know what I should put some jelly in this ha ha I like the eggs  they are so funny I love these they one of my youtubers I would just love to meet as a couple so right now I'm actually on the phone chase about a 20-minute wait time of course everybody's calling in everywhere this is one of the things I have to take care of today because turns out I have a couple of insufficient fees on my account and I'm just like it wasn't even like that so I'll have to call and see where all that is about so the next thing that was supposed to do today is go to H&R Block which is where I got my taxes done this year and check on this letter I got in mail no I'm not being audited or anything and nothing like that they're just saying they need another document and I don't know what other documents they need however looking at the letter it seems like when I submitted a pre tax cut paper from having health insurance they decided to take that off of my taxes because it wasn't either helping or not helping I'm guessing they needed that file documented so that's pretty much my thing is I'm just gonna have to go to H&R Block just to double-check and make sure unfortunately it has started back raining still a jury day I mean if it stops raining anytime soon right now is 3:45 then I'll head down there otherwise you know I'm a judge but tomorrow cuz I really don't feel like getting on oh right alright great news guys I got both insufficient funds refunded because it is not the time okay it is not that there was some misunderstanding about it there's a certain cutoff time that I wasn't aware of however they're very understandable and I told them how I understand everything is going on so anyways everything I handle their situations on control right now it is still pouring outside so it doesn't look like I'll be going outside to H&R Block or outside anytime soon for anything so you got me all to yourself in the house cuz you want promised price this one Bronx what's going on with you oh you're just gangster you ain't scared you ain't scared you ain't jumping you don't feel froggy you don't feel froggy oh that's why I felt better bad back the bad back Minnie girl are you looking at me like that cheering Jason oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  I got one boy I got one foot y'all inspired by Wilin out Oh harmony is so fly how fly is she she called chase and got bumped insufficient funds brie bud alright guys so let me get to you real quick just real quick while I eat it out am I the only one waiting am I the only one that thinks of this whole coronavirus situation right now in the sense of end game play it and what only one thinking about this like this anybody else looking at this being the glove or the the hand thing of Thanos like the coronavirus is the snap because they want to correct the earth just like a laughing but I really think about it though here we are here we out there is not only in this country or not only in this state in New York which is highly overpopulated but this country and also in other countries in the world such as China Japan like places that are overpopulated to the point where it's an order that you can only have one child outside of that of course over time we see how mother nature even though mother nature will always win but we see it's less trees more concrete when you look at the whole view of the earth from I guess let's just say many years ago to now like you will see more green back then than you do now and I just theoretically in the back of my mind tucked in a corner I just feel that we are in another version of in-game and Thanos which is the government it's planning on getting the glove to do the snap which is the coronavirus like oh my goodness I just want to make sure I'm the only one thinking like that I don't know no one thinking like that then that's cool I got probably dance shoes hey you know what are you let me tell you something so funny I was just like
