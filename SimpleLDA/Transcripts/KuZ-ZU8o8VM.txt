 good morning everybody so welcome back to my channel this is a blog I decided to go ahead and do like more vlogs style video and I am now deep conditioning with the three minute curl so I just like brushed out all of my hair I used to do or I have been doing like a side part on this side and just having like a little bit out but then I just like randomly did this deep part and okay so but I was just playing around with it but that's what I'm doing right now I hope you can hear in the background a virtual sermon tune in I'm gonna actually beam it to my TV that way I can like hear it better and bigger so I'm gonna do my church wow my deep conditioner is in I mean the luxuries of being able to do all this type of stuff alright guys so church is over I have watched out that conditioner now I have in a leave-in conditioner from Cantu and also the curling cream coconut curled and crane from can tool as well so I saw my hair still is very white I am about to edit I created a haul of sneakers that I recently purchased so I'm gonna go ahead and edit and you have a customer client so I need to work on his shoes so I'll probably be doing that a little bit later on today as well so then probably watch some movies or something kind of do a chill relaxed day  you I really need to film all of this stuff on this rack um I don't know I don't know when that's gonna happen I was thinking about doing that today but I don't feel like it I need to finish up my custom um so I probably ended up doing that today so I don't know why I feel like it looks so great like what's going on this lighting sucks it's very overcast today it's been storming like crazy here in Chicago in the Midwest in general um speaking of storming in the Midwest did you guys see the Nelly vs. Luda I was already teen Luda from the beginning but uh obviously he won he has way more hits yeah that's just how I feel about what's up guys so it is a another new day today is Wednesday I just put on my skins this is the short set and it comes with the like bra I don't know how I feel about it I'm not really impressed to be honest like the material it feels good but what I thought it was gonna be is not what it is like I wanted it to be thicker I wanted it to be like more kind contouring and conform to my skin like suck me in like it's just like some regular shorts actually it's like women's boxers and like cute but now the bra is bomb like I will say that that's cute but I'm not impressed and let me tell y'all like a legit Balt a lot of it too but I got the leggings to match and it's also in that same thin material I was thinking if these were not gonna be like long johns but that's kind of what they are and I got it in black as well so yeah cuz this price like legit for the 5 items I got it about 200 and something just kind of living in it right now trying to see how I feel in the same right now I am cleaning my apartment I had my music on I just want to like disinfect I just vacuumed my rug area and my floor I like to vacuum my floor especially since I got this mic there's a little vacuum I hate sweeping y'all I'm gonna obviously clean my bedroom as well cuz the bed hasn't been made nothing to spring down my glass I'm about to wipe it down fluff my pillows do all the things so it looks like this now and now it looks like Hartness in here but now it's clean all right it's a little bit later than the day and yes I do have a line as stupid bandana just went downstairs to go get my package okay so I am back I got some Nando's oh I am so ready to eat that I was telling you that I got some hair for when the world opens back up and I'm able to go get my hair done whenever that is until then I'll be rockin not this fro but up fro because I didn't do anything for this bro but yeah so I usually get my spring to his hair from Amazon you guys know I am customizing sneakers now and I've been getting a lot of stuff a lot of my supplies from Amazon I saw this phone case okay I saw a phone case on you to know on Instagram and it was so bomb it was pebbled leather similar to this except it was by a brand it started with a be I'm started picture here that is like perfect I want something that I can wear around my neck or like wear it like crossbody bag style I was like let me buy that I went to the website and that particular crossbody phone case is like 50 60 bit if I go on Amazon I bet I can find something very similar for cheaper and I did they have tons of colors I was just going to get one so I can see the quality of them they have a red one that I'm thinking about getting also a green and y'all know I love green I also have been working on my custom and I'm just like stenciling on some stuff right now I also got this mount and if you guys saw my recent Amazon haul you'll notice that I actually got amounts similar to this one kind of in same shape but it has a stand to it this mount actually is supposed to adhere to a mirror or to some type of tiles okay so Matt stop and ready I did not play about going downstairs and being around people I don't know I feel like every time I go outside of my apartment there's literally hella people so I don't take the risk I'm just you know I mean I don't know that this is not yes I am back in my safe sanctuary here's hoping I'm about to wash my hands wash off this face mask and kind of get started with it so luckily I just took my phone number and stuff down there because literally I just got a call I knew that they come like ups technically comes around 10:30 11 in between 10:30 and 12 o'clock so let me go downstairs my packages be right back but I'm not that open these were quick and I'll show you out a movie actually before I got the call so I'm about to finish making my so I also have been taking vitamins and I think I mentioned my vitamins in a previous video but I ran out of those and I think it was only like 60 in there I got a bigger one this one has 150 and obviously you take two a day I only take the gummy vitamins I want to share with you guys some of the home stuff that I got ideas just put on a face cuz I'm also debating about doing a fashion type of video as well so I got four candles from Bath and Body Works and they came protected which is great and these like cardboard little cradles for the candle the whole time just bluff okay so I got bergamot waters I love bergamot waters mm-hmm smells so fresh and so clean next to I got I believe how the same as well not the bergamot but it is the mahogany teak wood high-intensity this it's okay if you've never smelt this then all right what you waiting on this is like the sexiest man alive the sexiest man like after he took a shower that this is him the next candles I want to share ciao is actually from Capri blue if you don't know anything about Capri blue it's if you've ever been into anthropology and you smell the scent of the entire store they are always burning a Capri blue candle and it's called volcano volcano is the I guess most top-selling scent from Capri blue I went straight to the Capri blue site because I saw a sponsored post on Instagram and it says they had 30 I believe percent off so of course I I got a couple of things this box is kind of being so yeah so the first volcano scented thing is this hand soap it's hand wash it smells just like the volcano thing Oh oh my god this is upside down maybe I open the box wrong I don't know but my camera just flew out hopefully okay so I got the Capri blue candle and this size which I believe is the large and it is the 19 else and I got it in black because I want to put this in my bathroom if you guys saw my most recent bathroom update you know that everything in there is like hints of black and white and neutral and also that like ambered colors and the very next thing is this huge box got my look nice so this next thing is literally the same volcano scent I typically don't straightaway that other sins are okay but I'm not like super impressed with them but guys I got the biggest volcano candle and like it's always like I'm telling you anthropology never goes on sale these for it to be on sale for 30% off look like Black Friday in April or in May technically because of all fees this month but look how big it is so this is a 48 ounce so huge like the size of my head compare it to the 19 pounds oh my god it comes with two wicks obviously the other one is just a one wait so which one do I burn do I burn the volcano Capri blue or do I burn my bath and Bodyworks what's up guys so I'm editing the footage right now of this like week-long vlog and I just realized that I haven't like closed out or anything like that so if you are new to my channel thank you guys for tuning in I'm trying to be as consistent as possible trying to push out these vlogs I know that real life is about to hit us soon so I don't know what my schedule is gonna be like coming up in June so I'm trying to like just push it out as much
