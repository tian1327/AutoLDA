  hi guys just made some breakfast I've got some toast with peanut butter and eggs with ketchup and I made myself a banana raspberry smoothie with oat milk I hope you guys are doing well it has been really a crazy couple of weeks with the coronavirus and everything that is going on around us I hope you guys are staying safe and healthy and just being cautious and just like taking the extra step take care of yourself in your body everyday it is actually my spring break Sampson and I originally wanted to go to Orlando kind of sucks because it is my last spring break it's my last semester I really did want to do something but you know obviously it's better to be safe and there's always other times that we can go so this week I'm probably just going to be staying home at the end of the day I just hope you guys are staying safe and staying healthy and I hope that you know my videos can maybe take your mind off of everything that is happening for just a little bit and bring a little bit of joy to your day I will be continued to upload content at least once a week like I don't really do I don't think anything is gonna change up that on a lighter note toby is super happy because Sampson and I are home a lot to spend with him just filmed a video I'm about to make some breakfast right now and I'm gonna show you guys like my go-to breakfast these days I kind of alternated but it's around at the same thing so but you guys had asked to see you more cooking and stuff in my blog so I thought what better time when I am self quarantined so today I am going to be making some eggs a grilled cheese and also some fruits coffee and some tater tots I am going to start with the tater tots first I got the whole crew just preheated the oven and now dropping these in I'm gonna cook them for about 15 minutes also just quickly scrambling at some eggs okay now I'm gonna show you guys how I make my grilled cheese it is so so good I'm pretty sure this is how everybody makes that basically have two pieces of bread and I am going to use some butter and butter one side of it so because the butter was in the fridge it is like kind of salt it's like it's not melting but it's okay once you put it on the pan and then using like the flat pan like this I am going to put the bread on with the butter side on the pan so like this no my butter here like that let it cook for a little bit I kind of just like put the butter on the pan so that it goes kind of like on the bread as well so then for cheese i very like using shredded cheese but this is basically what it's going to look like and i'm gonna put this on top  okay now for the coffee I've been really lucky this all I have to do is just boil some water and I just poured it let's check on the tater tots pretty sure they are ready all right guys so this is what it is we've got some girl cheese mandarins some Tater Tot and finally some eggs oh and then also my coffee oh I had film this morning so this is like a brunch for me now so hungry here is a little close-up ooh the tater tots looks so good these scrambled eggs grilled cheese and some fruits all right guys today is the day I am going to tackle my closet here it is it is very very cluttered we are home a week so I am going to do some spring cleaning I'm going to get rid of some clothes and I sell them if they are in great condition or I'm going to donate them after you know this is all over and we were able to go out again I have a bunch of clothes over there in the back is boxes with my summer clothes so I'm just gonna leave that for now and then I have all of this so messy I can't and then I had down here which is my just sweats and stuff in here I have like my bags a lot of them I don't use anymore so am I gonna put them away or sell them or something and I have all my shoes oh just so much stuff that like it is so cluttered so yeah this is my goal for today I don't know how much of it I can do today and I will show you guys what I end up with the other day   all right you guys I literally just spent hours organizing and trying to get rid of things cleaning out my closet and I finally did it is pretty much done let me show you guys so this is the closet this took me so much time because I put away a lot of like my thicker sweaters now we're hanging before and I put them in the back already so when it starts to get warmer I'm gonna put the other thicker one like these like the thinner turtlenecks and stuff I'm gonna put them away but I left a few just in case you know it is going to get chilly still up here I decided to put all my pants so these are like my lighter pant my other color pants and then my black pants basically and over here it is all arranged my color got my blacks my blues my grays my like greenish brownish colors cooler Browns my warmer Browns my whites I have some sweaters that I left out just in case you know it does get cold and then in here are all of my clothes that I wear at home hoodie sweatshirt stuff like that so I store it away at some of the coats that I'm not gonna wear anymore and then I'm also donating some other ones they're like both mine and Samson's and then I organized my jeans these are the ones that I wear the most the ones that I grabbed once in a while and then I have my skirts workout stuff I have bunch of stuff that I am throwing away and then here are the things that I am donating and this is usually where I put this stuff that I'm selling I have a lot of items that I need to take pictures of so that I can post it on my Poshmark so I actually posted that I was like cleaning out my closet today on my Instagram stories and a lot of you guys asked me to kind of talk about it like how I cleaned it out and stuff like that and basically method is that if I didn't touch it in the last couple of months I you know get rid of it if it is still in really good quality like I only wore once or didn't wear at all then in that case I will be selling it on my Poshmark but as you guys know I do get sent some things as a content creator a lot of the times I don't even get to wear it more than once like just for a shoot or something and in that case I would just end up donating it because you know somebody else can definitely have better use so that's usually like my rule of thumb and I usually to a closet clean-out once I switched out like my winter my summer stuff so at the end of summer when I do a closet clean-out I get rid of all the things that I didn't touch at all that summer or only like barely touched and I know that you know by next year I'm just probably still not going to so then I get rid of those and then when I take out my fall and my winter stuff I look through it see you know what I want to keep and at the end of winter when I'm taking out more summer spring stuff I do another clean-out so I do a lot but also you know obviously I don't have a lot of room so I try not to keep too many things so yeah I hope that is helpful I am so happy that I clean this out today if you guys are in self quarantine and you have nothing to do try cleaning out closets it's really annoying to tackle offers but once you're done oh my god like it's just such a huge sign of relief it's like that annoying thing that just like always keeps pestering me like telling me oh you should clean out your closets but then I get really lazy and when I finally do I feel so good about it it is a quarantine day I don't even know but making some dinner right now I thought I would show you guys what I'm making I'm doing it some stir fry it with rice I'm gonna stir fry some celery and beef sausage and then stir fry some tomatoes with egg which is like a pretty traditional like Chinese dish and then I also am just steaming some broccoli I did a Instagram live today and a lot of you guys tuned in so thank you so much for watching my Instagram live it was actually like my first time doing it so it was a little bit I don't know it just like nervous but I really love to interacting with you guys answering your questions and thinking about doing it maybe like once a week or just like more often in general all right so I'm gonna start with a tomato and egg and basically I just raise the egg I have for interior or both me and Simpson and like if they have leftovers who would just eat that tomorrow okay just put in a little bit of olive oil and I'm just gonna cook the bacon first I wait for the egg to kind of like cook a little bit but not fully and at this point I am going to take it out into the bowl and then using the remaining oil I'm going to jump in be Tomatoes all right not like a minute later you see how it is a lot softer there's like some tomato juice out and I am going to pour the icon putting a little bit of soy sauce or like flavoring okay and there you have it now I am trying the celery and the sausage very really easy this I just put in all together with a little bit of olive oil surprise I don't want to add a little bit of soy sauce and then I'm gonna add a sesame oil I love to salut so I put it in like almost everything it's made with egg the sausage and celery some steamed broccoli and rice Sampson is over there playing his games I have been kind of loosing my mind being at home all day honestly is so I decided today I'm going to just kind of move my body and stretch a little bit I haven't been able to work out or anything obviously because the gyms are closed so I actually ordered a yoga mat so I can do like home exercises it's not going to come in until later this week but that's okay I am just going to use my floor in the meantime and just do some stretching and some light workout I actually don't have like any equipment I do have some resistance bands which I will use and I don't have dumbbells so I'm just using this like water jug in the meantime   myself inside  you  I just don't know what
