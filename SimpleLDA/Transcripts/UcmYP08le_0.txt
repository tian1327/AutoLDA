 so it's day so it's day six of the quarantine for me I know many of you know that I live in New York City if you don't know I live in New York City and and yeah like this is crazy like I ran to the bridge the other day and there was hardly anybody there at the Brooklyn Bridge typically tourists are there at 12 p.m. and I got there it was like it was a few of us but I'm just gonna be vlogging a lot of stuff that during this pandemic I know we're supposed to flatten the curve but I need fresh air and I'm making sure I keep the distance and some essentials that I have in my pocket are some Purell wipes because I am about to go on a run so if I need this yeah this is downtown Brooklyn and they are still working on housing and you see it going up yeah so they tell everyone else to fight in the turf but they still had to make their money by putting this this building up yeah I don't understand I made it to Brooklyn Bridge Park it was a little over a mile I am I just want to show you how empty this place is I think that lady just proved it because something just like went in my nose but I just want to show you how empty this Park is now it is approximately 2:00 p.m. and when I tell you people are out here at 2:00 p.m. they be out here at 2:00 p.m. I ran on that bridge yesterday the Brooklyn Bridge which was pretty cool but no one's out here literally I mean it's a couple people but ain't nobody out here like this is wild this is so wild but beautiful nobody Oh a couple people this is a tourist spot right here everyone comes over here and I've run over here quite often everyone comes over here to take a photo right there and ain't nobody nobody here so I just want to say that so all the people saying lattaker I respect that 100% I respect that 100% and I feel like but I do want to say you know when you say fly it's like here it is but I want to say that why is it that health professionals and the politicians get to write our history during this pandemic why do they get to do it why can't a person like mom share my story you know what I mean like I feel like I feel like I mean I don't think I'm a regular person because I'm Geum and like I'm just cool like that but if I am gone tomorrow this video that I'm making for you will be out there to show you what it's really like sure I don't know the numbers and how many people are dying like that's not my you know that's not where I am right now but I'm just a human being living in New York I feel like time has just stopped and we're like what literally no businesses are open well there are some oh man it's like a grocery stores are open pharmacies are bars or clothes but stay open and only need takeout and restaurants are only takeout the trains are still running but like I showed you in the other video like no one's here which is I I do have a degree in exercise and health science so I do know lots about health obviously probably not more than the health professionals but I have an idea of what's going on so I just want to tell people like if you're taking precautions keep doing that don't get mad at other folks for wanting to get some fresh air kids too people like me I have a dog so what are we gonna do in New York take him out on the fire escape is that dad you say homework you know yeah like and it's lovely because I get to just be here and just like see what's really happening okay I feel good I went on a nice ride it wasn't longer in the end my yesterdays when I ran four and a half miles yesterday yes I just ran from downtown Brooklyn over the Brooklyn Bridge and now I'm in Manhattan and honestly I could say for the first time in my life I ran from another city to another city like  so I had a nice time running on the sidewalks because a lot of people have taken over in New York and you know what I mean and they'll be like five people in a group hand locked hands and it's just little old me just trying to get by and like I didn't have to say excuse me you know like I didn't have to say on your right or on your left so time stopping for me this is a Thursday and we have  if you ever been three years  like just me and a couple folks in here this is so crazy to see 42nd Street the Port Authority Terminal yeah this is times how is it not that anyone is bumping into me right now that is crazy I am in Times Square right now and it ain't nobody but me and pigeons literally nice and other folks out here but if you're like it influence or something you could come out here and get that best pic that you've always wanted in Time Square because this is crazy this is a rarity what's going on it's like really serious right now um these steps that I'm about to walk up it's always people on them and I finally get to go on so yeah if you've ever been to New York City you know how these stairs are filled with people and to many of you who may be judging my video because I am not flattening the curve because I'm not in my house right now I don't want it to just be the health professionals and the politicians to write this history so if I leave this earth tomorrow you will have this video somewhere or like the people to come will have this video somewhere and yeah it'll show like an average person in a world where time has stopped because of something so like virus has taken over so yeah I know that everyone is in fear right now but then you can't see me send everybody I know that everyone is in fear right now and in panic and may have anxiety because of what's happening right now but hopefully you watch this video and you know you kind of get at ease that you kind of feel a little lighter because it is what it is right like of course you want to fly the curve but I don't want just to leave it to the health professionals and the politicians to write my history like this video will be somewhere when I'm gone and people are gonna be like oh my gosh like she blogs her life during this yeah I'm here what's there's lady cigarette ash just blew into my face I like I was about to say something but it's my fault that I'm out here right yeah but anyway there was also a lady vaping and she had a mask on and she moved her mask to babe like I think that's kind of as backwards like you are already killing yourself so what but is that me judging too much because if it is guys I've been looking for these gummies these gummies vitamin C everywhere I've been to target events at face value up until Walgreens I've been to Rite Aid I've been to online and they're all sold out of me coming to Times Square so we have to get in the game when Broadway is closed you know something be I see you Courtney I see you brother America all right I'm taking it back to the crib you know because my hands get a little cold and being prepared for more videos to come because like this is ding-ding hey my guys
