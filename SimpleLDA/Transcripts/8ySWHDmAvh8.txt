  what is up you guys welcome back to another vlog in today's vlog i'm super excited for this one because we are going to be doing a bunch of home decor slash apartment focused things for any of you guys who watch my apartment tour you guys would know that i live in what they like to call a studio loft it's just under 300 square feet and with that being said it is a very small space and my girlfriend is actually about to move in here just for a little bit until this lease is up and then of course the both of us we're going to eventually move into a much much much bigger space than what we have right now but of course for the time being you know i have to kind of rearrange things to you know make her feel welcome make make the whole apartment still feel super aesthetic and to our taste all the while making it just a little bit more functional for two people as you guys saw we went downstairs in my car to pick up this bookshelf that we bought from target and we bought a bunch of stuff to kind of like style it up i'm gonna build that and put it down here in the living room and just kind of rearrange some things so i'll take you guys along that and then for the days to come i'm going to rearrange my whole closet and then of course make some room for my girlfriend because she has to move her stuff in there as well and then the last thing that i wanted to tackle is actually upstairs in the loft area i want to do the same thing that i'm going to do in my closet and just make my clothing rack up there a little bit more spring summer focus but yeah like i said i'm super excited for this vlog right here just a bunch of apartment home stuff like everything a little bit more functional for two people in this very very small space this vlog right here is in partnership with the team over at curology i'll be talking about them a little bit more later on in the vlog like i said for today the big task is to tackle that bookcase build it style it up and all that good stuff all right you guys so as you can see this is currently what the living room situation looks like as you can see we got the tv up there and then we have my tv unit right here all of this is going to say the same the tv is going to be here and then the tv unit is of course going to stay so the part of the apartment that's actually changing is this guy right here this area right here was just a space that i needed to fill up it doesn't really serve a purpose i honestly don't even use the chair that much i want to just get rid of this and just make this area which was originally it's just a bunch of dead space that i was trying to fill i want to make this space right here a little bit more functional so this is where this guy comes in so as i mentioned we just recently picked this up from target this is just the room essentials five shelf bookcase it's in white so it's gonna fit perfectly with the aesthetic of this apartment so this is what we're gonna be building today and this guy is gonna replace this chair and this plant and then of course i'm gonna move my shoes i'm just gonna put it back in the closet but ideally this is gonna be here and this is just gonna fill up all the space and then like i said we bought a bunch of things to dress it up so i'm just gonna go ahead and just clear this area out right here i'm going to move the shelf i'm going to move the plant and the chair and my shoes and stuff and i'm going to get cracking on and building this guy right here i hope it's easy because it's from roomy central and it's from target so i think it should be easy but we'll see okay either i'm bugging right now or this is looking a lot harder than i thought it was gonna be yeah this is a this thing pretty thick like can y'all see that it's a lot of  instructions  are you guys so this is what it looks like right now after a lot a trial and error my girlfriend knows jesus you know what it's fine it's looking good we have to put some shelves there or we have to put some stuff there so we can line up the shelves yeah this is what it looks like what was supposed to be only like 20 30 minutes took like a little over an hour but it's fine put the shelves there and then we got a couple more bits and then i have some stuff here that i want to put here so i'll set you guys on a time lapse and then i'll show you guys after  the shelf is finally done so i'm super excited to share with you guys so like i said this is just the part one of this whole entire vlog throughout the week i'm gonna be filming like filming and cleaning a bunch of other stuff in the apartment to get ready for her to move in without further ado let's show you guys the new what is this called like a bookcase bookshelf a bookshelf and a bookshelf i can show you how to find the things but put your feelings to the side swallow up all your produce   lady don't you speeding through the city just to come and see you but you know i like it when you penny see through so shiny once you come right in don't be going round   i can show you how to find all right what is up you guys good morning welcome back to another day as i mentioned in the beginning of this video this vlogger here is a partnership and sponsored by the wonderful team over at curology you guys who don't know what curology is curology is essentially a dermatology provided skin care slash almost like personalized formula and routine this is what the curology packaging looks like right here definitely up my alley super simple minimal anesthetic curology is super easy to use and it's really easy to get started all you guys have to do is hop on the curology website and then take some photos of your skin before and then take an online quiz just kind of to see what your personal skin type is like and what you might be struggling with or what you might want to improve on and then as i mentioned a dermatology provider will go ahead and assign you a personalized formula for again your skincare needs and anything that you want to work on overall i just really love kind of the whole setup of curology i love how personalized it feels to me and i personally have been using curology for around three months now and before curology i just never found a skincare brand or a skincare routine that really stuck with me it's kind of hard to you know go into the drugstore and just see a bunch of all these options and it's very overwhelming so for me the reason why i like curology is because again it feels more personalized it feels like i'm getting what i need for my personal skincare needs and not to mention i just think it's super important to you know take care of your skin i definitely think it's one of those things that gets overlooked especially from us dudes but yeah like i said i can't recommend curology enough i just love again the whole aesthetic of the brand it works it feels great on the skin and the first link down below i'll have a link to a one month free trial and all you guys have to do is just pay a small little fee of 4.95 shipping check them out and go show them some love like i said skincare is definitely important um yeah i just can't recommend them enough so check it out show them some love all right you guys so as you can see let me turn it up real quick as you guys can see this closet is an absolute mess i don't know what is going on i feel like everything is again just super messy and it's just not functional right now so i just want to maybe take out some shoes or like some shoe boxes and then maybe put them upstairs or something and just overall i just want to make this space right here more functional and just better for two potential people living here this part is what we're gonna be tackling today oh i think what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna just take out everything pull them to the side and then just reassess how much space i have because i don't know it's just looking really rough right now so let's go ahead and take everything out and then we'll go from there and we'll see this whole box just attacked me right now wow  all right you guys so this is the current state right now as you guys saw that freaking box fell on me but anyways i basically took everything out the top shelf is fine i'm not gonna do anything this shelf could definitely be used can you focus please thank you this shelf can definitely be used and utilized better i'm gonna keep this shelf fairly the same this one i'm gonna fix and then as for the bottom one turn it up a little bit so you guys can see these are all of my balenciaga shoe boxes and my more expensive shoes so i'm gonna reserve this section and this shelf for just my more expensive shoes um so i'm going to leave that like that but these three right here these main ones are definitely going to get some work basically took everything out and then i'm just going to kind of file them back in and just see what i can do but first i'm going to decipher this part i'm gonna locate stressing out  all right you guys will update on this closet thing so the thing that i'm trying to do the most is i'm just trying to give my girlfriend the most space as possible so i literally took out a lot of things so this is gonna be hers this is already hers and then i think what i'm gonna do is to even create more space as you guys can see this top shelf right here is not really being used it's just a bunch of bs up there so what i think is and mind you my girlfriend's small she's like less than five feet so the less reaching she has to do the better so what i think i'm gonna do is i'm gonna actually take all my boxes up down here and i'm just gonna put them up there because i don't access these as much but i don't wanna get rid of these boxes put all my boxes up there so she can now have one two like this mini one right here so i'm gonna do that right now so let's see how it goes oh there is stuff up here nice crap what's up what the hell what the heck there's a bunch of random stuff let's put that away oh this is where my oh your camera's about to die by the way it's okay you guys i've been looking for these swiffer pads for the longest time i have a swiffer underneath my couch and and i thought i lost them it's right here that's good to know too hot are you guys so the closet is now done kind of nice to just like you know clean everything out but there's a ton of empty space for the girlfriend to move in all her stuff in and we created a bunch of many other opportunities for space throughout the whole apartment as well but as for the closet it's super clean and i'm super excited to share with you guys so let's get into the closet reveal three i don't know what's going on three two one when can we meet cause baby i've been trying to you on the move let's move to find some  because that's already her stuff and then three these three shows will be there for kia and then i moved up all my stuff because as i mentioned she's small so she needs to be able to access all of her stuff really quickly cologne bits i got my buzzer for my hair because we've just been you know self-isolating and stuff and then i have all my bags in here and just a bunch of miscellaneous stuff in here and then i moved all of my designer shoe boxes up here are you guys so i'm currently standing on the like ladder thing in the in the studio so this is what the current situation upstairs is as you guys can see there's my rack and then i have a couple of things that i wanted to incorporate up here from downstairs and there's a i just want to switch out and get rid of a ton of heavier stuff on this rack um so let's go upstairs i'll show you guys so this is the current state as you can see i am thinking with these boxes right i actually was going to take out my shoes and then i was just going to kind of put them down there and have them almost like stand up on the rack but what i'm thinking is christy of the homie daniel simmons i think i'm just gonna put my boxes underneath my plant over there i don't know about you guys but i personally don't like getting rid of my shoe boxes i think it just maintains the resale value and it just overall looks better than just having a bunch of shoes all over the place so i think i'm gonna put these three boxes underneath that plant and i'm gonna hang up these new in bits on this rack and i'm gonna reassess this rack and just pull a bunch of things up oh i like that okay so this is what it's looking like right now i don't know is it just me or i don't know i'm already feeling it are you guys feeling it what do you think i don't know i kind of don't like it should i just like put it there i don't know let's see what it looks like just in the boxes right but underneath the rack instead of it being propped up on the plan because i'm just not really feeling it so let's see that instead i think i like it this way better you know what it is i think it's because my studio aloft even though yeah it is a studio loft yo you know what it is i think it's because the studio loft or the loft portion of the studio loft in this upstairs portion i think the reason why i didn't like the boxes underneath the plant is because it made my plant look super tall which in return made the upstairs feel smaller because the ceiling is already short enough the plant is going like this right so you want your eye to be going like this you don't want it to be just going up and then oh it's like short ceiling you know so i'm just gonna keep it there i really like how it looks like all right you guys and then as for the shelf up here now looking at it it's okay i definitely can't get rid of some things but um like i don't honestly don't know why i have i don't know i kind of want to keep that you know it's so hard to like get rid of clothes and let go of them oh like okay well let me just let me just go ahead and hang what i know i want to hang so i just got this new in suit from asos so i want to go ahead and hang this guy  um all right you guys the upstairs is definitely looking nice and tidy as for the rack i just got rid of a couple things um but i definitely think it made a big difference and then with the shoes even though it was just like some boxes added to the rack underneath i don't know there's something about it i think it looks really nice and i think it definitely carries the vibe and the flow from downstairs to upstairs so i'm super excited to share with you guys the rack so you're not rambling let's show you guys the reveal of the brand new rack styling three  the way you feeling inside is  you know that i want you by and real quick before we check out of this vlog i wanted to show you guys and give you a little update on shelving unit right here we went ahead and we built this guy and we styled it and stuff and as you saw yesterday there wasn't anything on the top in that clip and in that styling way of how we did it i don't know it was just bothering me so we decided to add this droopy plan if you guys watch the apartments where you would know this is actually from the bathroom and then we just went ahead and put a nike box just to fill up the space the shoes obviously won't stay there forever the shoes are gonna actually go in the box but nonetheless i think having something on the top of this shelf just made it a little bit more homey and just made it a little bit more it just brought it all together i feel like when there wasn't anything on the top it was just looking very straight edge and very modular so i really like the addition of the droopy plant again it adds this nice kind of like soft vibe and another project that we're gonna do at a later date is as you guys can see the inspo board on the top flipped horizontally because we're actually going to change all of those photos and we're going to kind of make it a more of a collaborative effort because of course my girlfriend is moving in here so it's not just my apartment anymore gathered a bunch of new info photos so we're going to replace that when the photo center is like open and stuff to do that  all right you guys and that is it for the apartment update slash spring cleaning drop me some love in the comments down below let me know like what you guys think of the new shelf and let me know if there's i don't know let me know and put me on to any organization tricks or hacks or items that you guys use to create more space in a smaller like apartment and stuff because i'd love to know once again a big shout out to the team over at curology for sponsoring this video and supporting my channel i'm telling you guys i can't recommend a curology enough i feel like even though i've been only using it for a little over three months i can definitely see small but subtle changes to my skin or with the overall texture and it just personally worked for me so i'm super excited to again keep using it and hopefully see even more changes in my skin and stuff super easy to use it's nice and personalized to me as well as potentially you as well it feels good on the skin it works and overall just looks if you guys are interested there
