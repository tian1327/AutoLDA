  yeah whatever what's on your port  hey guys my name is sam welcome back to my channel if you're returning or welcome to my channel if you are new i thought i'd pick up the camera today to do a little vlog because i'm actually traveling from kansas city back to where i live in new york city um i've been quarantining the last couple of months with my parents so it's been nice to have a little extra room but um i am needing to go back to my apartment just because i haven't been there in so long and then also um just to have my own space back and everything so if you guys are new go ahead and subscribe to my channel also follow me on instagram for more behind the scenes of new york city it's been so weird that i've been here for two months now um didn't think it'd be that long but here we are i mean none of us thought it would be this long but gonna get ready to leave my outfit of the day my travel look featuring kit one of my sweatshirts that i never tie-dyed my little crossbody for the airport some leggings and my bag got this on amazon to carry some extra shirts back and just crap that i ordered while i was here it was like eight dollars you know tuck away to be very small so i can use it for my next trip and i buy too much stuff on yeah that's it bye kit  about to board the plane um they're boarding like 10 passengers at one time like everyone distant from each other other than that there's probably about 20 people over in this area right now because i think guys are going to be on display as a reminder face coverage are not required throughout the travel journey with delta if you or anybody in the party needs a mask please come to the podium at this time thank you for your patience and please remember a little extra space can go a long way please be mindful during the boarding process and allow free extra feed between you and your fellow customers thank you also if you're not wearing a mask there they all are offering masks for you to take on the plane with you um so there's there's actually a lot of people here not wearing one right now so they'll make you put one on before you even get on the plane which i think is really good and nice that they're doing that since they are all requiring um face masks on the plane so i think that's a good thing because i my dad made me bring some extras just like give to people around me just in case they weren't wearing some they're only letting about 10 people on at a time so um we'll just wait for them to call whatever my ticket is and then i will get on the plane then we'll be in atlanta  so  street  back to my apartment showered and once i was able to like put everything down and was gonna pop on here to like let you guys know how it was coming back it turned 7 p.m and the everyone is screaming outside just like you guys know every night at seven they scream for the front line healthcare workers and i am like about in tears because i've just been like looking forward to this moment for so long to hear everybody screaming and clapping and right when i was able to put everything down and feel like safe in my own home it happened so i'm literally about to cry but here it is i don't know if you guys can hear just finished the 7 p.m cheer which was so much fun to listen to after two almost two months of them doing this in new york and just watching it on tv and on social media i actually got to hear it in real life so that was very cool um but anyways got my sorority sweatshirt on i don't have too many clothes that are out of the wash or that are in my suitcase that i'm just like letting sit out there for a little bit um so this is what we got tonight but right when i walked in i took out my trash i cleaned out my fridge which very luckily there was not much in there given that we had just moved the week before um and then i jumped in the shower to and put my clothes like in my laundry um and they're just gonna sit there for a little bit um probably for like three or four days i won't touch anything in my laundry it won't touch try not to touch my suitcase besides the things that i need and just let it sit by the front door but did that got into some comfy clothes ordered some food i love by chloe and always reminds me of new york so i ordered some by chloe the taco salad that is the best there and i am just going to kind of hang out tonight and very excited to be back in my room i missed it so much and yeah um today was a crazy day of traveling just like a very unreal experience and a very different travel experience than what we're used to and i do want to share a little more about it um so i'll probably pick up the camera again tomorrow or tonight after dinner just to kind of share what kind of precautions i took to be as safe as possible while traveling and then also what the airports are like because i think a lot of people just like don't really understand um what airports are doing to keep us safe and what we should account for before we step foot in the airport so definitely going to dive more into that um later on so definitely going to be first and i think it's almost there or almost here i think i saw that it was on the way so yes going to eat hey guys good morning it is tuesday may 19th um i got back to new york a couple of days ago on sunday from home from kansas city back to new york um to my own apartment here it is brand new i was living here one week before i went home before all the craziness happened in mid-march so it's good to be back in my own space to a brand new space so still getting stuff in to furnish it getting a home desk set up things like that but love it here so feel very comfortable coming back regards of what is happening outside in new york city i am safe at home staying inside for a very long time so this is my life now um but i am still like very happy to be here i think this is a really good place to be right now so i feel very safe inside i hope you guys do too and i am going to kind of take you guys through a day in my life at home and just throw this in the same vlog of me traveling through the airport and what it's like right now with um cover 19 and everything so i just woke up well not just woke up i guess i like kind of woke up at 6 30 um laid around for a little bit got my phone but it is now 7 15-ish and i'm going to do a little workout class um i have melissa wood and then also core power so i might do like a longer core power class this morning um because i need a good sweat so maybe one of those yoga sculpt classes so we are going to put on that yoga sculpt class and um i like to watch youtube while i do the classes too it keeps me entertained because i get really bored and i'm going to throw on somebody's blog so quick note i always use this little phone stand to put my phone up with the classes um it works perfectly because i hate having them on my laptop my laptop on the floor i don't know why that just kind of bugs me so i use my little phone stand and download the apps and then i will put it on the floor in front of me and it's like the perfect little setup for my own class i will link below if you guys want it it's from amazon i just finished yoga and then i took a shower did not wash my hair so thank god for hair clips to make you look professional and zoom um i'm just wearing my biker shorts today and a tank top i'm probably going to throw like a shawl or something like that over this top i get sometimes i get hot in my apartment so i like to wear tank tops but not zoom professionals so i'm definitely going to cover up a little bit um on calls but before that i'm going to make some coffee because i need some and then make a quick breakfast so let's go do that i actually don't have any groceries right now uh besides like non-perishables and some frozen food and i am getting a fresh direct order today so you guys will see that delivered i have no idea what's going to come in it i ordered like more than i usually need because i heard that they actually when they run out of stuff they just won't um they won't substitute with anything they just won't deliver it so i'm hoping that i at least get more than half of what i ordered um but we'll see so i ordered like some fruits and veggies um eggs i'm actually trying to do no meat right now so substitute substituting that with like other proteins like peanut butter which i already have and some beans and good rice um i don't know why i'm trying to do no meat i just i don't really want to get like dependent on meat right now because of all of the plants that are shutting down i know meat prices are going to go up so um just about to do like vegan vegetarian for a little bit and see how it is but yeah that's what we're doing um i'm gonna make some coffee i'm obsessed with this little nespresso machine missed it while i was away very much my parents have a keurig which i also love because i just love coffee in general but um i do miss mine espresso so let's make some coffee we'll figure out what's for breakfast so well that is brewing um so for breakfast i have some trader just granola and then some banana chips i think i'm just gonna like make my own little mix um with some granola and then add in some banana chips because fruit i guess i don't know not the best substitute for fruit but it's still fruit at the end of the day and we have ourselves a little gourmet breakfast with some that i need to mix that there we go i just drink it out of the straw and this is my little work setup i have my water this stand is the best i got it right before i left because i knew i'd be working from home i just didn't think i'd be leaving um and it's from amazon only like 30 dollars and it was so easy to put together this is what it looks like it just slides under the couch like that and it's a little dab we got our fresh direct order in and i think the guy is bringing up the case of water that i got too i'm going to disinfect all of these right now i kind of got out of that habit when i was in kansas city but definitely here i will disinfect everything very well with clorox wipes and then put it away  brian  foreign  thank  just finished my work for the day and i um finished like cleaning and organizing all the groceries that i got earlier and now i'm going to make some dinner with a bell pepper that i got and then the leftover no gnocchi that i made last night for dinner um but while i cook and like cut this i thought i would just come on here and kind of talk about traveling and what that was like for me on sunday so two days ago now um because i've been getting a lot of questions about like what it was like to travel what to take caution of like is it safe to travel i know no one's traveling for fun right now but is it even safe to travel at all and what it's like um so i've put in some that was very scary um i put in some videos of like what the airport looked like and talked about it a little bit on instagram but pretty much um there's not a lot of people at the airport at all and a lot of people are wearing masks but not everybody and that was a little weird for me i was like why why can't you just wear one to make everyone around you feel comfortable and i guess that's just a personal choice of theirs that they don't want to wear one for whatever reason i know they're uncomfortable but like if you can make the other people around you feel comfortable then why not just do that um so yeah not everyone was very mass but it is required at least on delta to wear a mask on the plane so you either bring your own or once you get to the um they take your ticket to get on they'll give you one if you don't have one and then you have to wear it the whole time but not everyone around me was even wearing it the whole time on the plane which kind of made me anxious a little bit um so i mean you can give one to somebody but you can't force them to wear it or you can maybe delta just wasn't forcing it like that um i don't know i had i wanted to travel back to new york anyway so is the risk i was willing to take um but you can tell like the flight crew was was cleaning everything in between they even said that um the they have companies come on there and like deep clean the entire flight they give you a purell wipe right when you get on and then also they give you like a little snack bag um with like a water and a couple of snacks so they don't have to like go through with their cart and everything and it has a little tube of purell in there too so um so yeah so you don't have to bring your own i still do but they definitely equip you with everything that you need just in case somebody else forgets theirs um so i do like that they are taking precautions like that so i did feel a little safer then once i got in the uber he was also very safe about everything too he had like a a mirror up or like saran wrap or something from the back seat to the front seat he had gloves on he was wearing a mask i'm sure he's very worried for himself with all these travelers coming in his car so i'm glad that he did that that made me feel a little better um yeah it was it was a weird day it i didn't run into any issues i guess like the whole thing is kind of like a big issue in itself like that it we have to travel like that for the unforeseen future so yeah that's like a little bit about my day yesterday sunday um i hope that helps answer a couple of questions about traveling if you guys have any more questions feel free to put in the comments down below or just shoot me a dm on instagram happy to answer them for you guys but yeah that was pretty much it um got into my apartment took a shower right away um haven't seen my clothes since i just put them like right into the corner i'm not gonna touch my suitcase for a couple of days i've been getting out like what i need out of my suitcase but um the whole suitcase is just going to sit there at the front door probably until this weekend just to be safe with everything and then i'll put that away and the remainder of the thing's in there i've been really careful with packages lately i've been opening them at the door taking out what's inside cleaning it off and then leaving the packaging at the door until i feel like i have enough to like bring downstairs and then of course i'll wash my hands use purell all of that kind of fun stuff um yeah and it's just gonna continue from here on out yeah i'm going to continue making dinner i'm gonna cut this up and then throw it in the pan and cook it a bit and then we're gonna eat we got some um kale and broccoli gnocchi with some green peppers and cooked in some tomato sauce and then i just put that over some greens um a little leftover bread right there and that is dinner so i will probably stop the vlog here um hope you guys enjoyed a couple days of my life and especially just seeing what the airport looks like and what my travel day looks like um if you want to see more vlogs go ahead and subscribe to my channel i would love you to do so and i will see you guys next time
