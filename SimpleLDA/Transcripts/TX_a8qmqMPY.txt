  what I'm seeing might be reckless but I meant it when I said and I know I'm mad but it's time I get the lesson will be thinning zzzz don't listen  I can stand to see the stars  would you come a better soon wait in my bed I was until you get to the  I know but what do I choose your Matt layout for your island this weekend they are speaking his language oh my god doing oh my god no no no no thank you no idea yeah naughty cat who knew kids live in one crossing the official meal of attention you see this back here George just a while looks Gorge this is the Gardein and I put when I make fajitas I probably should've showed you this but I did it when I make me does I just do like taco seasoning mix and I just dump it on there on one side I do Frank's redhot seasoning one to make it a little spicy and then these are my friends her name is Emma she does her own seasoning so this is uh let me show you this home first actually she has this one which is amazing so season that you're the yin and then this is the to my yang and I love this one I've used so much I got this the other day ever to use this much because my foods never been seasoned before so here's what you can put it on chicken fish pork meat eggs veggies pasta this is so freaking good and it's that really expensive Ina Garten always use it it's that really expensive salt so it's called Florida self and it's a French salt French sea salt and then it has garlic spices different things it's so freakin good so I have a big one of these and I'll put a link down below she has a website where you can buy them and there's $10 and get a whole thing of this this literally changed my food and then this one's so good this is kind of smells like barbecue II this is a black sea salt and it has a whole bunch other stuff in there you could take a look at it but oh my god these are so good I put that on there too or on the chicken and then I put that fleur de sel okay it's in here I put this one on the fleur de sel seasoning on the vegetables because it makes it really fragrant and stuff and I just like it cause it tastes way better it makes the vegetable taste good so seriously exchanged my food and I'm like where the hell have I been doing I've been eating bland a spoon I'm gonna put links down below it's called impeccable eat shoes the best okay the best really nice person say oh by the way since she's an entrepreneur no real one oh thank god say oh I had to do my nails by myself which they don't look good like this took me way too long because I had to take mine kerlix well it's been a while since I've been a nail tech but I'm back so did that obviously I can't do my own hair I wish I freaking could but I'm just gonna wait it out I mean whatever I guess that saves me money right so here's this spread we've got the vegetables chicken I forgot to tell you I also put lime juice on the what I'm cooking those we have our daya this is the best sour cream ever okay cut you whole sour cream I think it's it's new yeah it is new we've got these well then these are the tortilla torch these are tortillas we use handmade style from tortilla factory oh my god this is movie because we just ain't you're not to wear them oh my god I'd never look this ugly before oh my god oh my god you know what got any cases that have been solved anyone got any open cases yeah I think you're about to catch a case like a pervert so anyway this is what we're doing as in our social distancing okay we're okay ordered this a while ago this is uh called hunter-killer and it's like a mystery subscription box and we you basically you get a case file close your eyes no you get pause you can't pause a video okay you stop recording okay this is a mystery subscription box and you have to catch a killer it's kind of like clue and I guess that you I don't know what it is really I just ordered that because I had a free trial or every month you get a box with new clues about the killer you get like a case file everything says everything you need to guess the box  anyway you get like a case file and you're supposed to like catch this friggin killer so that's what we're doing this month we have to figure out what though what's in here should I open it yeah CheY go get to Mike Orton no they literally have it set up on the website they have like you know in CSI when they do like yarn and like this person's connected to this murder board yeah I read about it and told you about it you said no it's like a true detective what what did you read what did you find you're gonna want to take a look at this you're like sure like you're watching yeah you're whoa that's a clue this is I know what this is this is a cuff a shirt cuff oh my god oh yeah yeah okay today I want to show you what I've been rocking with okay so this is my at-home setup that I've been using so if you didn't notice I took like a week off obviously I've taken like three weeks off on this channel but I'm taking like a week off on my main channel and all I did was play Animal Crossing and World of Warcraft and I'm just gonna show you my setup and some of my favorite things capeesh okay so here we go this is gonna be alarming just so everybody else this is my setup okay so you know if I just leave it up here I look like I'm living large but then I show you this and it's kind of sad it looks like I've been sitting here like wasting away which I have you'll notice first this is new okay I got this because I had been watching it for one full year this is the razor blade 15 quarts laptop okay Rx 20 60 something like that very expensive gaming laptop however usually $2,000 when I got it for 1500 and I think it's still on sale right now so I'll link it below but I initially did an unboxing of this and then I never uploaded it so yeah there you go oh yeah hedwig on my screen so anyway this is a super-fast gaming laptop I love it I've been using this for like a month now I just happen to buy it before this whole pandemic happened and it turned out to be like the best purchase ever because everybody's stuck inside and when I liked a game I don't think like I sit at my computer like at a chair upright so I like to sit obviously in my disgusting setup but this is the last time I use again so fast I don't think I've lagged one time I know lag is more internet but this is it's just so fast I love to game on this big freakin screen and it's pink it's an all pink laptop and I want to it's just like I I'm so happy with this purchase I mean yes it was expensive but I had saved up for it for a long time and got it on sale so yeah that's the laptop I use I just used this shitty little mouse it has these little keys on the side because I bind my spells to it for world of warcraft yeah my I'm a creep for sure so anyway I got that laptop desk from Target a long time ago hopefully they still sell it I'll try to look for it online but if I can't oh well this is the most alarming thing about my setup I put a mini-fridge next to my setup so I literally don't even have to get up and I will show you what's in here so this is a I just got this this is a cool Lully mini-fridge you can get it on Amazon this is a little bit more expensive than the other one but it's bigger and it's very quiet so I've had mini fridges in the past that we're not quiet this one you do not even hear at all which I like and it keeps everything obviously really cold so I have Oreos in here I have I have quite the variety okay so just get ready I have a diet cherry 7up I have a Coke Zero back there I have a this is a new monster flavor it's pretty good ultra Rossa and then I have a Seagram's and then I have right here I have my wander Beauty eye masks which I like to just pop on when I'm sitting here so yeah it's a pretty good size mini-fridge and then I have my bark thins which I probably shouldn't be eating but I like this it's a really cute just you know kind of salmon color pink gorgeous and again you don't hear it which I like so I have that set up and here's the view from over here so this is very important body pillow behind you regular pillow up here so your back doesn't hurt got it soft blanket also a major key okay major key and you'll notice I'm facing the TV which we got mounted so I have at all times my remotes this is sad I have my remote so I have my Amazon fire stick you need that if you have ace like a TV it turns any TV no Smart TV obviously you probably already know that but I well I have Hulu I have all of it so I sit here and I watch American Idol or I watched twitch streams and that's pretty much what I've been doing and then I have been playing this the most so this is Jarvis's switch and I've been playing the new animal crossing new horizons on here this is what I've been doing if you are bored during this quarantine get animal crossing new horizons it's the most fun just casual game I love it so much it's so fun you guys I just like I I'm addicted I am addicted I don't know I can't show you my town right now but I sit here and I just that's what I've been doing I have it out of charger never have to get up sometimes I put it on my TV but not usually so anyway that's what I've been doing so that's my at-home setup right now you're probably wondering what is wrong with me and guess what comfort ladies and gentlemen comfort this looks kind of apocalyptic this is what the city looks like out of our windows it's randomly sunny right there so anyway I'm gonna make some it's already 3:30 I'm gonna make some lunch even though it's 3:40 where is the day God just so everybody knows this is I sent drivers to the store this is what he comes back with this was like a week ago and I'm like what are you doing like we don't get anything but rounds like I am disgusted but here's the thing this is if you want to know what the last pasta sauce was of the pandemic that was still on the store shelves this it must suck like this must be the war sauce ever because it was only emeralds left so here's what I do this is a great quarantine meal a great one if you're on a budget okay and don't freak out this is a chicken packet of ramen but the noodles are vegan so I don't use the pen I don't use the packet but I use instead you can use this this is um better than bouillon organic vegetarian it's vegan and this keeps really well you just keep in your pantry and you only need a little bit so let me get the water good again this is not healthy by any stretch of the imagination but again if you're like in a pickle and you need something that's you know cheap you can store it in your pantry if you can't get to the grocery store it's easy to make this is a good option here's another meal that I made affordable and really good so these are my favorite I do the Brooks hot chili beans and I'll just do a can of these and I'll do rice and then I do vegan cheese or if you're not vegan or vegetarian you can do regular cheese and I do like hot sauce with it too you're gonna get some amazing heartburn but good again cheap this is like two meals I would say so I just like eat half the can and then I save the rest and stores well very affordable rice very affordable let's get the quick in a box rice what have you guys been watching leave a comment what have you been watching I'm assuming you guys been watching Netflix YouTube I have been on chicks watching tic TOCs love it but you know what I was on Tic Tac I hate to be this person but I was on tick tock like one of the first people and tick tock has changed so much in a year dude okay tick tock used to be so much better than it is it was like fun it was like the Wild West and now it's like only beautiful people doing dances okay and that's just not what I want to see so I'm kind of disappointed in tick tock I'm not gonna lie but I do I get on tick tock a lot but yeah that's what I've been doing I mean I haven't started watching that one what's that Netflix that everybody's watching Tiger Beat you're King Tiger Beat is a teeny bopper magazine I'm pretty sure anyway what are you guys doing I'm so bored and pretty bored right now I'm not gonna lie this is looking good that looks like ramen news okay that looks like ramen dudes so let me show you what's next who's ever given a tutorial on making ramen noodles I don't know who needs that but I got these from the Dollar Tree a long time ago I'm sure I hauled them but I bought two of them and I love them I use them for everything okay so if you ever go to the Dollar Tree I don't know if you stole but I think it is but if you do go to Dollar Tree dude pick some of those off because they're so good I put my chili in them I put my beans and rice my ramen noodles any soup that I eat mac and cheese like everything that I eat which is the four main food for mac and cheese ramen noodles chili and beans chili it means I'm saying oh it's spaghetti spaghetti is the fourth guys this is crazy today can't even see that is maybe peer in the mist Niki boo boo okay hey guys so you're probably like why are you getting ready right now I am gonna go to the store early in the morning because we don't really have any groceries and I couldn't get an Amazon fresh order today I'm using the glossy a birthday bomb calm that has it has like glitter in it it's clear but a head of glitter Ina Garten visited the colossi headquarters and recommended this she said it was her favorite thing that so I literally got on it glassy eyed that day and ordered it but yeah I'm gonna go to Whole Foods just early in the morning and I'm not gonna touch me buddy I'm gonna stay away from other people but I really need to get grocery so I'm gonna bring my cart I feel like I look so cool like I'd say my outfit earpods in my 1975 playlist on ok so anyway this is the outfit I'm wearing this sweater favorite sweatshirt ever from expressed and they have this on sale right now by the way but this is supposed to be for an express haul video that I bought this is probably a month ago was supposed to go up in the beginning of March um I love this sweatshirt it's so soft I think it's cool it's a little bit cropped but then I have of course this bag you guys all know it this is from princess Polly who loves it but it's out of stock I just saw that and then I have these pants which Jarvis says they look like snow pants but I love these are from Nasty Gal and I hope I can find a link to them if I can't oh well but they're kind of like utility pants they've got these zippers and I think they look so freakin cool like street wear and then I'm wearing my Reeboks which I love my mom got me these for Christmas and it was like a random gift if anyone remembers so yeah that's the fit and I'm gonna wear my sunglasses from Nasty Gal so yeah yeah yeah there you go people  I can say this    pack just wash my hands oh my god oh wow gorgeous I really wish I could do a video with that in the background I don't know how to but I just got back oh my god that is craziness I ma'am they're very responsive Whole Foods is to this whole thing but what I just went through I mean I've never seen anything like that before that's why I just feel like the need to document this because I'm the Chicago Casey Neistat just getting him not but I mean I don't know how all of our seats again in our lifetime so anyway so I go there everybody's usually like wearing masks pretty much there's Purell everywhere they have barely anybody is in the store though and again I usually do Amazon Prime but in the city it has been if you don't wake up at like 6:00 a.m. to do your Amazon fresh you're not going to get it and then also you're not going to get your order until like the third day so there's it'll show you three time slots so it'll be like for today it's Thursday so it'll be Thursday Friday and Saturday Thursday and Friday are already like all booked and they have been for like two days and then the last day you only have I along one timeslot option and it was from 5:00 a.m. to 7 a.m. and some of the stuff I was gonna order it wasn't even available so I was like you know what I'm just gonna go to the store and just trying to sanitize everything but anyway so I go to Whole Foods right duh and the checkout process was wild so they have they have it taped off which this is good all this is good but they haven't taped off so like where you're supposed to stand right and you're not allowed to put your stuff on the belt until the next person is completely gone out of the area and leaves and the worker has to sanitize the belt every time somebody puts their food on it so I had to wait for the guy in front of me to leave and get his stuff and she had a sanitize at all she had to sanitize the pin pad again they have huge plastic guards up and they're wearing gloves and masks the people that are checking us out the employees and then once she sanitizes it you're allowed to put your stuff on but they ask you do not bring your own recyclable bags anymore so after all these years of me being shamed walking into Whole Foods like I'm the biggest loser on the earth because I didn't bring a reusable bag the tides have turned because now they say please don't bring our reusable bags nothing from the outside I don't even know if I should bring my cart anymore when I go like to the store I don't even think about that but now they've I think they've waived the bag tax or something but they won't even bag so like they didn't bag my stuff for me they made me bring it over to I had to bring it all over to the counter bag it over there and I couldn't bring my bags outside of my cart I've never seen anything like that before and then the lady behind me of course there's got to be some lady and again it's like you know it's overused but this lady was a Boomer and she's like seriously oh I have to get it like what I can't even get food online anymore from you guys it's like do you think these people they're they're working Whole Foods do you really think that they want to be  berated right now I almost said something but I think that violated my six feet distance rule because I would have beat the out of her this person was sober than I mean the girl was she was that checked me out and then checked the lady out after me was very nice I literally probably would have put this person at Hadlock if I could fish and because then she says well you know ma'am we just asked like this is a given by the by the state please they just did this a few days ago please don't bring your reusable bags next time it's fine if you did it this time because like people don't know right and she goes are you kidding me and starts throwing I mean I watched her this thing had an arc to it it goes like this and I watched it fly under the thing she's throwing it like this like really I probably should have tipped or something I don't have any cash and I don't think that they want my germy cash but it's just I mean obviously nobody that watches these videos it's gonna do that it's just like it's frustrating I mean I saw it firsthand today so anyway I don't know what to do now because I don't know if I should sanitize all the stuff I got I don't have like this Lysol spray I do have a lie saw thing where I could wipe it down bring it over in my bag and then I'll just put it away as I do it and I'm not gonna let it touch my counters but I think I got I got bagels because I can't get them any other time I'm putting in my freezer and then I just put him in microwave for 30 seconds and they're back to normal tell movies which is great I haven't been able to find these anywhere so I got to Gardein by the way a lot of stuff is not healthy but I'm trying to get stuff that I could keep well you know so this was the fine of a century Rosen Traviata that's my favorite one I got more of this I've been using this and it's you know fine this is the only cleaning spray they had but this is the honeysuckle which nobody cares about this story that I'm about to tell but this is a scent that when I first moved into our first apartment this is the first cleaning product I ever bought and I think that the memory will come back to me so this one I feel like is okay to put oh my god but anyway I got garbanzo beans cuz Jarvis has been making his own hummus so I just figured I would get it for him the little things people the little things get him a pair Easy's he doesn't give a get him some chickpeas he cares um I got this is I'm excited for peanut butter balls oh shut up her ass get milk oh yeah I have some in the back whoo I got this I love this you can get this these are so good and you just put him with a little pasta little pasta sauce so chiton old tortellini I got two of these because they were out of all the other chicken patties these are really good by the way I did just to Obama won't like fill you up for a lunch so I'm just gonna get that easy to make easy to keep my got these I've never tried them before but I thought it might be a good time I don't I never liked cheese it's growing it up so I don't know really why I got these but I'll try them out and then I got taco shells for when I make tacos I got this oh my god I've been meaning to tell you guys about this kite he'll has new sour cream it is bomb like the best sour cream by a mile oh it's so good like literally so good okay so we got that I got this by the way the light in my fridge is out which is just great but I got these tofurkey this is the best pasta angel hair from Baltar's about this because it keeps well and I like it the Daiya shredder style I got these chewy bars they're so good no vegan and the vanilla chip is like it tastes like a chili s'mores have you ever had that growing up and then finally I got I got a case of water and then I got these not chicken kids I like I'm better than the bullion and I showed you yesterday so I just think they're more flavorful I think they have more msg so tell you why like you know quit my water way and I'll be right back      all right so I just played Animal Crossing for an hour cuz guess what I had some business to take care of KK slider was on my island today so anyway I got some stuff in the mail I just got my packages and I wash pans okay wash my hands try to disinfect so let's start with this I got the Kate Somerville retinol vitamin C moisturizer it's a firm and brightened and I got this because I saw some people say that it's good to use a rut no you're only supposed to use it at night use once a day apply thin layer to face a neck okay reduce frequency of use okay I'll still wear sunscreen okay so this is what it is I got this because I had a coupon code for Kate Somerville through magic links so it's one of those pump diddy dum city's push-up I mean I'm just gonna use it now it says the only use at night you're only supposed to use retinols at night that I dunno woah kind of like that I mean what I'm a lot damn I'm gonna put it on my oh wow this feels like citrus wow this is an expensive moisturizer by the way so I need to start using a little bit less because if I like this then I'm gonna have to borrow this I'm committing to too many expensive products lately like I fell in love with this trifecta and toner and now I'm like I don't want to spend $40 on a toner but I really like it so I don't know ooh this feels good it smells like citrus my favorite before I went cruelty free when I worked at Sephora I love with the origins like whatever one is in the orange tube tub the Oh ginseng moisturizer and I loved it just because this mouth didn't care about any of the moisturizing benefits didn't care this though smells so citrusy I just love the smell citrus it makes me so happy and in my skincare all I pretty much look for is citrus smell which is not really good but I did I want to give an update I did go through the whole entire wander Beauty deep dive moisturizer and I loved it so I'm gonna have to restock on that and thankfully that's a little bit but anyway okay so I got some stuff from Express I mean I'm gonna show you guys this again in another video but I actually bought the some of my own money so I guess I wouldn't have to show it in the video but I will still I bought my own money because I logged on to my Express and I had a $40 credit and I'm like oh hi like I usually I've never had that much in credit usually have like ten dollars or something but you gotta $40 credit for your birthday so I was like oh hell yeah boy so I got these I thought they were cute I this is this is themed on like staying home comfy cozy actually that's all my house so anyway I got these little velvet scrunchies with the bow I love the bow scrunchies and I just thought they were cute this is like the aesthetic of this with the other stuff I'm planning on getting that I've already gotten so then I got these these are like satiny joggers and they have a nice waistband you can see that I always get medium across-the-board I just feel more comfortable in a medium can I probably fitness mom I don't know maybe not but these are nice they have pockets I actually have and I'll show it in my what I do my Express haul but I have the there's a like a rose gold kind of Mavi color it looks like it's like this color in these and I've been wearing those a ton so when I like something I just buy it in all the colors so I got these in a medium and they're joggers nice joggers you can wear these ones I don't know if I could wear my pink ones out in public but these I could wear out in public and they're cool okay look expensive everything is like fifty to sixty percent off online on express right now and then I thought these were also very really I thought these were very cool these are apparently these are the same freakin thing these are the same oh wait no they're not they're a little different but they looking almost identical so these I love because they're just that you know that like that look everybody has these days that aesthetic look where they're wearing all kind of neutral tones and then like a hint of blush you know I'm talking about I feel like this is right on it it's kind of it's just this natural color this it's like an off-white I just I really like these it's got the thing at the bottom so I'll link these again these are really affordable right now at least I don't know what it's gonna be but this is from their 111 line they need to add more stuff thanks for us if you're watching this please add more stuff to your 111 line because I just love it and they don't have enough stuff right now I feel like for like staying at home they probably didn't realize that this was gonna happen obviously like but they need more loungewear at all times like on the website I think every clothing store just needs to have loungewear because I need to shop for loungewear I'm so annoying so anyway yeah this is what I got that's my little haul not a whole lot but I do like to experiment with different pants so anyway I'm gonna end the vlog here because I'm gonna start up a new one I'm gonna edit this one hopefully get it up then I'll see you guys hopefully very soon with another at home vlog bye
