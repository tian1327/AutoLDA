  Hey Denali down south here except up in New York right now during the whole coronavirus thing except let's see this is what middle of March hopefully it's about time I post this it's fizzled out and not too many people have you know suffered it and I didn't mean I know when I'm posting this some have we're up here for a wedding and delivering some supplies to the family that don't have access to it just to to prove what when it is here I'm going to go ahead and plug this in without cutting not very many people out on the streets it was a easy drive-in so I just went for the car to load up here hopefully this doesn't get too crazy okay Google I think this was working okay Google Angela dotto okay Google why I feel embarrassed maybe it still distracted everything okay Google yeah I don't know it's not coming up with stuff on that on the on the car here so well just do this a different way then I'll just take it grab my wife's phone to show you all and but they would have done this want to try one put your phone in embarrassing here connected that's making noises okay Google huh I don't know okay not loading up so we'll just go ahead and just do it on the screen and I'll show you okay so say that and we're supposed to type in there's there's an easier way to do this and without you know flipping the screen and be like yeah you're editing stuff okay today's date Sunday March 15th and then just type in NYC you can see location got a little doc there that's where we're at and I'll hit news and you see de Blasio considering lockdowns see coronavirus kernel virus corner iris hopefully you caught all that on the on the screen there so you know what you know kind of what day it is so I didn't blog the vlog the trip up here cuz it was kind of rushing to get up here and we just wanted to you know focus on the traffic we did run into a blizzard or not really blizzard about some decent snow actually on the way up we didn't push through as hard as we usually do on our drives up here just because you know we didn't want to stress your bodies and compromised our immune systems so it took a little longer than normal to to come up here we also um you know as I said up here for a wedding that really got you know downplayed and a lot of our events for the wedding got canceled so yeah so hopefully it's not too many people have suffered hopefully I don't get that the virus hopefully I meant the family do and hopefully the world has learned from this experience  yeah my wife's phone is ringing and yeah it's just I don't you may have seen in other videos how busy this place has been before so just wanted to show you that now turn the camera around  so CeCe so yeah as you can see a few people are out but not many again hopefully no one has not my people if I suffer then  yeah hopefully you know the world has learned self-reliance more and not to panic and go crazy so hopefully we've learned a lesson and hope I don't get anything and family doesn't get anything and everything as well take care so I got dragged back out here to the Woodbury Commons and as you can see it's pretty deserted now compared to last time and you can actually hear the music in the background here that they're playing hopefully it's not coming through too much on the video like last time a lot more people kind of rounded out poor so you can hear it as well and hopefully doesn't come through in the video and so I don't get a copyright strike I mean I guess somebody's talking on it right now so if I can't hear it but it was playing just a minute ago I'm coming through pretty clear so see this place is deserted and I didn't really want to come out here but I got drugged out here I guess so no remember how to do a return on something they bought out here last time and I don't know so just as good feeling remember I run random out here yeah so here we are just again to show you kind of the effects of what's going on right now yeah yeah yeah yeah so I guess kind of a nice thing and I mean of course there's no nice thing but the whole coronavirus thing though is the roads here in New York are pretty clear so makes driving a whole lot easier so I mean that's kind of kind of nice but again at what cost I mean you know people getting sick the economy going crazy all the panic and stress so that's not cool but you know hey at least the driving is nice no I mean trade-offs not worth it but hopefully you know one my family gets sick hopefully no one in your family get sick or worse from it and hopefully we society learn to you know from this painful lesson but hopefully we learned and you know FLE I don't get sick and I'll probably add to this video if something does happen and maybe you know I'll post some videos after this of you know changes that will make in our lives it's just eerie I don't know if it's gonna get your ear as things go on oh yeah oh right now they're still getting ready for the wedding I'm just going to get lunch for everybody might break it's ready yeah not nearly as busy  so let's run back down to the 7-eleven to get a Clorox pin because the bride got a little bit of a pizza entrance on her dress I told her to be careful so how do I get those rumors about there being interstate travel lockdown hopefully that doesn't come true yes if it is declared hopefully they give a timeframe and our plan is to bail out if that happens hopefully it doesn't happen I mean it'd be terrible on our you know freedoms to travel I hate to be stuck here in a place we don't know very well um you know yes we'll see what happens but it's an interesting time for sure yeah so we took a lot of precautions up there in New York and we had our you know hand sanitizers and masks and Lysol and wipes and you know we didn't go out anywhere definitely stayed away from you know a lot of people at social distancing stuff as you see I'm wearing my glasses even so I just don't touch my eyes as much with my contacts a lot of things where a lot of plans were changed up in New York to stay away from people as soon as the wedding things events were over we hightailed it out of there got back took everything out of the the car even things we didn't we're used we you know put those in its little kind of quarantine area themselves and sanitized it spend a magnet of three days washing those and sanitized the vehicle there and you know wash those clothes clothes and everything that we brought even if we didn't use it you know we still washed it and you know been pumping up on our vitamins and you know veggies and you know lots of water and stuff and just you know I'm trying to keep healthy and stay away from you know people but also getting fresh air and not going out and everybody's been doing okay we took a lot of precautions up there and yeah a lot of precautions as well down here so we're all feeling feeling well and everybody up there doing well so that's that's good and we usually of course take some health precautions when going up there but you hit a lot this time I mean gloves as a city loves hand sanitizers wipe slice all you know it was AI always extreme this time and yeah when it was I mean the wedding events were over we were we were out we're gone because we didn't want to stay in a hot spot for for long so here we are one week later from getting back in quarantine here at the house everyone's doing okay our state just got put on the lock down Martian City got put on the lockdown a couple days ago and then the major metro area about a day or two before that got put on lockdown as well right now the global case is just looking at the TV's over 400 to 60,000 with over 20,000 deaths almost 21,000 deaths and in the u.s. over 64,000 cases and almost 900 deaths also I saw just in the county I'm in alone right now the count is 27 deaths I don't know what the furs are just burst in cases not desperate just cases it might just be cases I don't no one hyped that up too much if it's just cases and not desk maybe there's just cases you know the family up in New York feeling fine my family right here is doing fine one of my daughters does have a slight fever but no but he's showing any other symptoms besides that her fever might actually have been caught when well from a different circumstance that I can't really get too much into or at least don't want to talk about it on video but some of you already know what happened yeah but it's not real he involved with me or my wife currently getting her exposed but overall what we're doing okay so I think I'm gonna post this right away is kind of with the other footage I took I do usually do a lot of these videos kind of way in advance I figured just how timely if in saw him and do this one or the video of the site soaked in New York Plus this one just kind of up together and then maybe in one year post a video as well showing maybe just kind of a progression of how things have gone maybe a little snippets put together of videos that I've taken related to this topic altogether I don't want to do like a weekly update about it and just be too much but just kind of yeah just put them all together in this short video maybe in a year showing an update I think that'd be okay and then just continue on with the other uploaded videos as well as as they were normally scheduled I think that might be okay because I want to overwhelm you know the servers and your media you know your social media feeds with you know updates cuz I'm sure that's already blowing up with everything so I figure I'll just just do that but just as of this upload everybody's doing okay so just yeah you know normally I'd say you know a get outside and you know it's fresher be alright but I guess the outside responsibly but really just you know don't panic and keep your head about yourself is the main thing about it so take care
