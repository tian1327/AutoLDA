 world war crazy feels so spooky  don't come for me in a comment section for leaving my apartment I'm not just going to stroll around I'm actually going to the post office to ship something that I sold on Poshmark here's my box using a target bike just because the box was big and I don't want to just hold it but I did sell a couple of things on Poshmark because we are moving and I decided to clear up my closet and you know make things easier for me because I don't want to move a bunch of things that I haven't used in so many months or even years so it's just so much easier but yeah I'm gonna hunt right now to go find a post office that's open oh yeah I'm not just like going to stroll around I'm actually doing necessities that's why I oppose Rama's open because it's considered a necessity like a liquor store I mean I have legit not left my apartment and over a week we've been back from Brazil for two weeks and we left our apartment wants to go do grocery shopping and ever since we've just been doing deliveries like food deliveries and grocery deliveries which I'm not gonna lie was a challenge too but there's what it is you know there's a lot of people here and everybody wants to order their food in because they don't understand a line the whole foods line we love a block away from Whole Foods and the line is literally hours long like I haven't sued a line to actually know how long it takes but judging by how long the line outside is I realized that I didn't want to do that    all right I ship that mother-lovin package everybody seemed friendlier for the first time at USPS because every time I come to this USPS there were so unfriendly that I would normally do USPS pick up and even pay extra for that but they didn't have the pickup service available for today so I had to step out and come here so yeah please don't come for me again in the comment section if you like I have to specify that like over and over again because people are so mean these days online that's actually why I kind of took a little YouTube break because people are so much braver behind the screens and they are in real life and it gets to you you know no matter how thick your skin is the comment section still kind of gets to you but I'm over it now I don't care I do have to specify regardless that I am NOT just walking around I went to USPS because it's a necessity we have so many liquor stores in this neighborhood and I'm honestly really surprised to see that they're all open and I looked it up I thought liquor stores being open is just a joke I looked it up it's not a joke apparently liquor stores are considered more essential in a liquor store is more essential than a hair salon is honestly a bald head and alcohol that's my takeaway last time I went outside I did wear gloves and a mask that I got for $700 that was made of gold but because I saw nobody outside I felt like it wasn't necessary for me to wear gloves this time and since masks prices have risen so much because they're being made of platinum right now I decided to save it the next day well is an understatement of the century show them how emptiness yeah both sides of one of the most busiest train stations in Manhattan in this train station sometimes I have to miss a train because there are so many people that I can squeeze myself in I can't hop in so I have to wait for the next train to come like during rush hour I usually have to wait for two three trains to be able to hop in because there's so many people that you just can't get your turn and this is what the train station looks like today and we are heading to our doctor's appointment so it's a necessity that's why we need to be outside I have to say this over and over again and I just decided to take advantage of the situation and film probably the most dramatic vlog of YouTube because this is gonna be dark right I'm just shocking to see New York look like this so stay tuned because our doctor is somewhere near Times Square so I'll see you guys there such a freaky train ride we had we only took the chain because we obviously need us a film and we knew that it was empty from my previous vlog but this guy walks in and every single seat is available like nobody's inside except for us he could have picked any mother-lovin seat and he says right next to us so we obviously get up and sit a little further from him and he goes oh guys and he starts coughing like like either he's really cool are you was just trying to piss us off and scare us off I don't know what the deal was really he's mentally unstable right yeah he's obviously mentally unstable why would she do that in public you know there's something that I read a couple of days online what a time we'll live in we used to cuff to hide a fart and now we fart to hide a cuff totally applies to him like I would have much rather had him fart than cuff is silent clothes chain  I've got a question for you guys do you think life is ever gonna get back to normal once the country reopens look at this I am in front of an iconic theater the majestic theatre you know Phantom of the Opera you know because in the history of humanity this has never happened before right yeah in the history of humanity my parents are saying that they have lived through World War they have lived through communism and they have lived through four different wars and they have never seen such a thing before right now we're in Bryant Park I have never seen Bryant Park this empty before in my entire life I have to admit look Bryant Park looks much better yeah without people in quarantine yeah it looks so clean and looks so quiet and peaceful I mean there are people sitting and enjoying you know a cup of coffee as you can see people are passing by but they're definitely maintaining their distance from one another they're definitely following the protocol and saying at least six feet away from each other so that's good we're doing the same thing again please don't come for us in the comments section we're not doing anything wrong we're all geared up highly protected we're staying away from people I'm not just six feet apart but actually more so yeah we wanted to show you guys what it's really like in New York City because most of the people fled the city we're all by yourself here and I feel like nobody will ever get this kind of footage in their entire lives except for me and we're done we're the Bryant Park station it's so so empty right now it's crazy feels so spooky right so yeah safer than ever because there's nobody around and we're not infecting anybody else if you were sick but just wanted to give you guys a little tour of what it's like and the most infected city taking the risk for you guys so we deserve a big thumbs up and if you made it this far you might as well subscribe right let's get out of this sooner rather than later right exactly stay safe stay healthy we'll see you guys in the next vlog
