 - Special thanks to Hawaiian Tropic for sponsoring this video.  Hey guys, what's up? It's Raven, welcome back to another vlog. This is just going to be another spend the day with us type vlog. I really don't have anything special or crazy planned for the day, but you guys have been saying that you just wanted
to see more vlogs of us just kinda chillin' and doin'
our thing, nothing crazy. So that's what this vlog is going to be. Of course we're still
staying home right now, so like I said, nothing crazy. But just come along and spend the day with us, let's hang out. So I actually just got out the shower. We woke up late today, I'm not gonna lie. Today is a Friday and it feels like a Sunday or something to me, I don't know. I'm just not really feeling
super duper productive today so we woke up kinda late and Ziya has actually
been doing online classes. Yes, because she does
normally go to school. It's not just like a
daycare that she goes to, it's like an actual, like,
preschool and it's so cute. Like, she's still getting her story time and getting her lessons in. So yeah, that is what
she's doing right now. I've been really trying to make sure that she tunes into all of the classes since they are at like certain
times throughout morning. I just set alarms on my phone because she's been out of
school for quite a while now and I don't want her to
start forgetting everything that they were learning and forgetting her Spanish and stuff. I'm a little late to the game this morning trying to finish up getting
ready and doing my skincare. I always cleanse my face in the shower and then I do my serums,
and then my moisturizer. I do have my DIY eyelash extensions on. If you guys have not
seen my little tutorial for how to do that, it is on my IGTV. And my eyebrows kind of have like a faux eyebrow tint to 'em, which I showed you guys in
my pamper routine video, so definitely check that out. I've been really liking the way that this just kinda helps me feel more put together
without having makeup on. I think I might start doing
these eyelash extensions, like, all the time. They hold up pretty well. But I wanted to tell you guys about two new products
that I have been using. In my recent vlogs, I've been
saying that SPF is important. Like, you wanna make sure
you're wearing sunscreen. Include sunscreen into your
every day skincare routine, especially if you
struggle with acne scars, hyperpigmentation, wrinkles,
any kinda skin issues, and especially if you're
using products on your skin to help with those skin issues, you really wanna make sure that you're putting on SPF afterwards to help protect your skin from the sun and to actually let those
other products work. Because if not, soon as you go outside, the sun is just burnin' up your face, making all your dark marks darker and just undoing everything that you're trying to do
with your skincare, so. I have been using these two
Hawaiian Tropic products. These are new. These Hawaiian Tropic
products are really nice because they do offer
UVA and UVB protection. They're made with really good skin-loving ingredients and botanicals, and they actually do have
the Skin Cancer Foundation seal of recommendation for daily use. And they are cruelty-free. This one is paraben-free and
it's reef friendly, as well. So again, this one is the AntiOxidant Refresh Sunscreen Mist. This one has green tea in it and this is just good to
help prevent skin damage, of course, in general. SPF, in general, we're trying
to help prevent skin damage, but this one just has
really good ingredients to prevent skin aging and stuff like that. This one is SPF 30, and this is good for your face and body and it's just a nice little
lightweight non greasy mist. So literally after you do
your skincare, you cleanse, you put your serums, your
toners, your moisturizers, whatever you do for your skincare, you can literally just...  You can literally just mist this on the same way like you do with your, like, makeup setting spray. And as you can see, it's
literally, it's not greasy. It kinda gives you like a little
bit of a glow, I would say. But it's not greasy at all. It's super lightweight and
you can literally mist this all over your chest and shoulders. You can mist it all over your body, but I really like to
just mist it over my face because I feel like it allows the rest of my skincare
underneath to not be disturbed, if that makes sense. But I'm still getting my SPF. I like that it's in this little travel-friendly bottle as well because this is something
that you can throw in your bag and take with you. If you need to reapply,
or if you are traveling, you could take it with you, but this is really an everyday skincare-type
product, like I said. Every day when you're doing your skincare, mist this on as the last
thing, your last step. If you do prefer a more
lotion cream type sunscreen, I would recommend the Matte Effect lotion. This is just more of your
standard lotion consistency, but this is a matte lotion so it's actually going to
absorb the oils on your skin to give you that nice smooth matte effect. Not greasy at all, super
lightweight as well. This one is SPF 50. It's mineral-enriched with
naturally sourced sea minerals, and again, it's reef friendly,
cruelty-free, all that stuff. So if you prefer a lotion, you can use this one on
your face and body as well. But if you just want something
super quick and easy, I definitely recommend the mist. So if you guys are interested, you guys can click the link
below to shop Hawaiian Tropic. Okay, so now that my skincare is done and I'm feeling nice and moisturized, I'm going to make myself some
coffee and some breakfast. Ziya already, I gave her breakfast earlier while she was doing her online
school so she already ate and she's upstairs
playing in the playroom, if y'all can hear her.  She's playing with her baby dolls upstairs so I'm gonna make me some breakfast now. I wanted to show y'all, like, I have been, I have been really into
the air fryer recently. I'm like late to this trend, but. 'Cause I feel like a couple years ago, everybody was talking about air fryers and how it was healthier and you can make all types of stuff, but my mom actually had one
and she wasn't really using it so I took it and I've been using it and just experimenting with it and I discovered that you can make really good crispy bacon in the air fryer and it just seems like it's much faster. I like to make bacon in the oven 'cause I just like the crispiness, like the texture is way better. Oh, there's Ziya. The texture is way better than
when you do it on the stove, in my opinion, 'cause I just
like extremely crispy bacon so I normally do it in the oven, but then you gotta preheat the oven and that takes like 10 minutes, then you gotta put it in
there and it takes like, what? 15 minutes to cook. So it's like a whole 30 minute ordeal just to make a couple slices of bacon. But, in the air fryer, it
doesn't need to preheat, so you literally just plug
it in, lay your bacon out. I have a little small air fryer. They make bigger ones where you
can fit more stuff in there, but this one works for me, especially since I'm only making, like, one or two servings for me and Ziya. You just lay it out like this. Try to make it just like one even layer. I kinda had to shove it in there because I have a smaller air
fryer, but this is, what? Like five pieces of bacon,
which is good for me and Ziya. And it's so quick. So I usually put it on
maybe like 390 or 400. I'm gonna do 390 just to be safe 'cause I did burn it one time. And then put it in there for, let's start with 10
minutes and then check it. And you're good, you don't
have to preheat it or anything. In the meantime, while
that's going for 10 minutes, first of all I'm gonna
put the rest of this bacon in this Tupperware container because they don't know how
to design good packaging. Like how hard is it to put a Ziploc, like a zippy closure or somethin' on the frickin' bacon package? Like, what? I feel like that should be like a given. Like, we don't eat a whole
thing of bacon in one go. We need to be able to close up the bacon! I would like to write a letter to the bacon corporations of America and tell them to put a
frickin' zipper on the package. I'm gonna make a petition. Who gonna sign my petition? Comment down below if you would be willing
to sign my petition 'cause it pisses me off every
time I open a bag of bacon. Anyways, in the meantime, I'm gonna make myself some avocado toast because I like to put bacon
on top of my avocado toast. If you haven't tried
it, it's a game changer. I like honey wheat bread. It's not gluten-free,
but gluten-free bread, it's just not that good, usually. Sometimes I do eat gluten-free bread when I'm trying to be respectful
to my body but honestly, I don't like gluten-free stuff that much. So toast my bread. Meanwhile, I'll get my
butter and my avocado ready. I have this half of an avocado left over from yesterday when I did this. This is like a perfectly ripe avocado. We love to see it. Sometimes it's so hard to catch an avocado at the right time for optimum ripeness. This is a really good one. And then I get my seasonings ready. So I just do salt and pepper, but I also like to do a little bit of red pepper flakes and garlic powder. Toast is toasted so I'm
gonna butter the toast and then spread the avocado on top. Butter while the toast is still warm. Then you take half of
this half of avocado. You just divide it between. It's like the perfect amount. So I scoop out half for one piece, and then the other side
for the other piece, and then you just kinda smush it down. Just like that. Okay, my bacon needs a couple
more minutes in the air fryer so in the meantime, I thought I would show you guys
how I do my whipped coffee. This is like my own version 'cause I was experimenting with it ever since I discovered it on TikTok and now I've like mastered it and it's so good so let me show you. A major key that you need for this, or that I would recommend, is one of these automatic whisker things. And then you need instant coffee. I just eyeball it 'cause
I've done this a lot, but basically it's about one to two tablespoons of instant coffee. And this is the little cup
that came with this thing, but you wanna do this in a tall cup so it doesn't splash everywhere. And then you put your sugar. So again, like one to
two tablespoons of sugar. Kinda like equal parts
of coffee and sugar. This is the way I do it. This is not the traditional way, okay? Then you wanna put a splash, like, again, one to two tablespoons of water in here. And then kinda just
incorporate that all together, mix it up. And then, and you don't
have to warm it up. That's what I've discovered. At first, I saw people say
you need to use hot water, but just regular room temperature water, I just got this water
from my fridge, is fine. What are you doing? -  I just smelled
the bacon in there. - Why are you running around?  What are y'all doing? Ziya and Bougie are just acting a fool in the background of my cooking
show right now, you guys. Okay, so there you got
your coffee, sugar, water, and this is where you start mixing. So it turns into a really nice, creamy, thick, whipped cream-type consistency. So you should get something like that. And you can see how it
literally quadruples in volume. Like, this whole thing is full now. Then, this is the Raven's
ratchet kitchen secret touch. You wanna take some ice, and I have these little mini ice cubes because my ice machine in my fridge broke and I only had this small
little mini ice cube tray on hand for some reason, so I made all these little mini ice cubes, and they actually work perfect for this. I mean, I guess you could maybe use crushed ice or regular ice cubes. Because something about having the ice, it makes it whip up even thicker. Careful not to splash or spill it. I guess if you use ice cold
water, it could help too, but it just gets like really thick. Like, really thick, like that. Like, look at that. Ooh, yes! Then you put in the rest of your ice, like a normal amount of ice
to make a iced drink, like so. And I like to put in some
of this vanilla syrup stuff, like that they use at
Starbucks or whatever. So I usually like two
pumps of the vanilla. And honestly, that really sets it off. Like, I highly recommend adding that in. Maybe vanilla extract could help too, but I like the syrup
because it also sweetens it. And then, to make it into a latte, you add your milk of choice. I like oat milk, vanilla oat milk. And pour that in there. Get yourself a nice
eco-friendly bamboo straw and mix it up gently. Ooh, look at that. Delicioso. And it should still, like,
maintain its creaminess, even after you put the milk in there. That's why I like to whip it up super thick in the beginning. And voila, you're done. This is so good. It has almost like a roasted
caramel flavor to it. I think it's something about
whipping up the coffee. It like, the sugar, it almost like caramelizes
it or something? I don't know, but it has like a really, like, unique flavor to
it that you don't get from just like a regular iced latte. So good, you guys. You have to try this if you like coffee. Okay guys, so the bacon is done approximately 12 minutes later. Look how crispy! I like extremely, extremely,
extremely crispy bacon, like almost burnt. Like, I don't want any
piece of it to be chewy, so this is perfect for me. Look at that! Super good. I mean I know you could
get the same result on a frying pan, or in
the oven, or whatever. This is only slightly quicker, but I think I'm honestly
just kind of obsessed with the air fryer right now so I've been using it for everything. Oh, I should have put my sea-- I got too excited. I got too excited, I forgot to season. Hold on, let me take this off. You gotta season your avocado first. Oh my god, I'm so hungry. Salt and pepper. Got ahead of myself. Then garlic powder,
just a little sprinkle. And then red pepper flakes. Then you put your bacon strips on there. Like so, like that. My presentation gets a three out of 10, but I'm telling you, this is so good. If you like avocado, if you
like BLTs, anything like that, this is super good. And Zia loves bacon so she's over here. She was sniffin' around. You want some? You already had breakfast,
but I guess I'll share. She got her bowl ready. Bacon in a bowl. Here you go. Where you goin'? Sit down. Where you takin' it? It hits different when you
wake up late and you're hungry. All right, so it's a little bit later now. We're about to go out in the backyard. I am gonna take a little bit more of the Hawaiian Tropic mist. Close your eyes. We can make sure that we are protected from that hot Texas sun. What, Bougie? You wanna go outside, too?  Bougie literally acts like a dog. He cries to go outside every day. Okay, come on. We have to keep a eye on him. I do let him come outside
with us sometimes, but, we have to really keep a eye on him 'cause I don't want him to get lost. There's a lot of ways
that he can escape, so. I don't want him to get lost. Ziya has been loving the sidewalk chalk. Unfortunately, I talked about
this on my Instagram stories, the red chalk, apparently it's a thing that red chalk stains really
bad and I didn't know that. And this whole, like all three steps were completely covered with red chalk. Like, I literally tried everything to get that red chalk off of my steps. I was like scrubbing it, I was rinsing it down with the hose. It's supposed to just
be, like, it's chalk. It's sidewalk chalk, it should come off easily with water but, whatever's in that red pigment, it stains really bad
and I didn't know that. And so it would just not come off at all until finally I did bring
some bleach out here and tried to scrub it with some bleach, and so that's why now
it looks pretty faded but it's still not completely gone. And I also didn't want
to use too much bleach because then it's gonna
rinse off into my grass and everything and I don't, like obviously that's bad for my grass and it's gonna kill my grass so I was like, let me just stop. So anyway, my patio is still somewhat stained with the red chalk, but I have since decided
to just let Ziya, you know, color all over the whole patio because I think at the end of the day, nothing is getting that red chalk off so I'm probably gonna have to hire someone to come out here with a
actual pressure washer and just pressure wash
the whole entire patio, get all this dirt and stuff off anyway. And hopefully that gets all the chalk off. But for now, I'm just like whatever. Just mess it up, just
color as much as you want, and then I will fix it later. I'd rather have her be able to actually, you know, play out here. But yeah, I'm glad that this
is at least in my back patio where nobody can see it instead of being like in my front driveway because if my front driveway was covered and stained with chalk, I would low-key probably get in trouble by my homeowner's association
or whatever it's called. 'Cause my neighborhood is
like a little bit strict with their requirements on
keeping everything looking nice, so at least it's back here
where nobody can see it. See, this is why we have to be careful when we lettin' Bougie come out here because he be tryin' to run away. There's like little holes,
like drainage holes in the wall that just lead outside
to the great unknown, and you tryin' to run out there. Now you wanna act shy. What are you doing? Don't run away, Bougie. You have to stay where I can see you. I draped Ziya's baby pool
over the table to dry it out. It looks like some sort
of weird tablecloth. This is what we've been doing every day. Comin' outside, blowing bubbles, playing with all this stuff.
- Hot dog! -  A hot dog? Where did that random hot dog come from? -  I'm gonna shoot you! Mommy, I'm gonna shoot you!  -  What is that? - It's a circle of white. And what color does it change in? -  Try blue and
yellow and rub it together. And rub it together. - It's changing into a color! -  Kinda. Okay, Ziya, make sure that you
clean up all of your stuff. Put your chalk away and your
pool noodles inside the cabinet and back inside the boxes so it doesn't blow away
like it did last time. You gotta make sure everything
is put away and secure. Kitty, what are you doing? That is not a litter box! What are you doing? No, get out.  Oh my god, he's covered in chalk! Oh my god, you're so dirty now!  Bougie! What did you do? You just went and rolled
around in the chalk! Look, reason number 57 why I should not be
lettin' you come out here even though you beg me to come out here. Bougie, where are you going? - Come back here! Ugh. - See, most of the colors spray right off and it's not a problem,
but the black and the red. Like, it's supposed to
just spray right off. They need to put a warning on the package that says use the red
color at your own risk. Okay, so it's about three o'clock now and normally Ziya should
be taking her afternoon nap but she is not asleep. We have been fighting naps recently. I guess she feels like since
she's four years old now she doesn't need to take naps anymore. And maybe that's true, I don't know. But she really has not been going down for her nap very easily and we've been skipping a lot of naps, so maybe she's done with her nap phase. I don't know, she's growing up so fast. But anyways, since she's not taking a nap, I am actually going to drop
her off at Grammy's house. She loves going over there
because she is spoiled over there and also she just gets super bored with staying home 24/7 recently, so at least if she can
go to my mom's house, it's a little bit of a change of scenery. And I need to go to the
store because, y'all, some of you guys have
been waiting for this and asking me about this, but if you remember my video where I tried to do my
own fluid art painting, I painted this huge canvas and it just did not come out
how I wanted it to at all. And also, when it dried, all the paint cracked and it's just not the
result I was looking for so I had told you guys
that I was gonna try and just paint over it and just redo it. So it has been sitting in my house just looking sad ever since then. That was like, what? Like maybe a couple months ago now? And today, I'm finally like you know what? Let's do this. So I need to go to the
store to get some supplies. I've got my mask and my
hand sanitizer ready to go to make a quick trip to the store and see if I can get what I need while Ziya hangs out at my mom's house and then I'ma see what I
can do with this painting. I'm scared because I didn't have a good experience the first time. This canvas was kind of expensive and I've been really
wanting art for my house, so the pressure is kind of on to make something work with this canvas, otherwise I'm gonna feel like I wasted a really big,
real expensive canvas. So anyway, I'm just gonna go and see if I can find the paint that I need and we're just gonna go for it. Y'all like my outfit of the day? It's super hot outside but it's always super cold in the store so I have my little, like,
Texas summer outfit on but then I got my leopard cardigan. It actually kinda matches, low-key. For it being cold in the store and then I have my mom slides on 'cause those were the
quickest shoes I could put on. I look a hot mess, my hair
is stickin' up everywhere, but you know what? Quarantine fashion. It is what it is. Okay, so I just dropped
Ziya off at my mom's and I just also wanted to mention that the only reason why
I am going to Michaels to get the paint supplies is because it's right next
door to my grocery store and I do need to get some
stuff from the grocery store and surprisingly Michaels is open. But since I'm already
heading in that direction to go to the store, I thought I might as
well just go in store, and honestly, I need a
change of scenery so bad. It's been how many weeks now? About two months without
really going anywhere besides the grocery store. Like literally, grocery
store, mom's house, my house. Grocery store, mom's house, my house. I literally have not even gotten gas. I have been trapped in my house. And me being an introvert, to feel trapped, that's saying something. So, even just me going
to Michaels right now feels like a vacation. It feels like something
very fun and special to do. So I'm just taking advantage
of the opportunity. All right, y'all, so I got
the goods, I got my setup. I'm using the same setup as
I did in that original video. If you haven't seen it, go check it out. But my first plan of action is gonna be to just take
some plain white paint, not mixed with anything,
just plain white paint, to kinda paint over
this whole entire thing. And hopefully it'll kinda fill
in the cracks a little bit and cover up the messiness
that's goin' on on the side and just kinda even everything out to give me somewhat of a blank canvas to then try pouring the paint again. I know I said that I wasn't even sure about the pour paint technique, but I'm just determined to get it right. So, I am gonna try the
same fluid art technique, but first I gotta do that,
like, base layer of white paint. All right, say good bye.  I'm trying to do a really thin layer because I don't want it to be really thick and end up cracking again, but it is kind of working
to fill in the cracks, at least a little bit. I just splattered paint in my face. Ow, it got in my eye! All right, I washed the
paint out of my eyeball and then I finished putting like a really thin coat
of regular white paint. It's actually almost
completely dry already. And so now I'm about to mix up my paint. So here's the thing. They did not have any of
the normal mixing medium, pouring medium that people
recommend that you use, which I didn't use last time, which y'all said is
probably why it cracked. But they didn't have it at the store and they also didn't have it on, like, I just wasn't able to get it. So I looked up a solution and I got two big bottles
of this flow acrylic that kind of already has a
mixing medium mixed into it. And then I also do have some
water and I have some glue. Like white glue because people said if you mix white glue into it as well, it will help with the cracking. So I'm kinda making my
own little concoction, but definitely not just
using water this time 'cause that did not work last time. I do have a little bit of water if I need to thin it out even more, but I made sure to get two big ol' bottles of
white paint this time.  Okay so here is my mixture of flow paint, glue, and water. And I'm mixing up all
my paint ahead of time and getting all my paint ready. That was another mistake
that I did before. This actually might need to be thinned out a teensy bit more. I didn't like the super yellow
gold that I used last time, so I got this bronze one. I'll use like the tiniest bit of this and maybe also this color
just so it's more toned down and matches the tones in my living room a little better rather than yellow gold. Here goes nothing. I'm not gonna think about
it, I'm just gonna do it. Well, I managed to cover
the whole canvas this time. But I still hate it. The design is even worse than before. Like, the way that the paint
mixed, I just don't like it. I just don't like it. Maybe I just don't like this style of art. I really don't like it. I would not hang this up on my wall. Maybe some people would,
but it's just not... Nothing compares to
the first tester canvas that I did in the first video. Like, this design is not as cool at all. It just looks...  I hate it. I really thought it was
gonna turn out better. I mean, at least, at least I didn't run out of
paint this time, just barely. But once again, I would not
hang this up on my wall. So you know what? What do I have to lose? I'm about to take this piece of cardboard and do a scrape across
the whole entire thing. I'm just messing around at this point because this canvas is
about to end up in the trash with how I'm feeling right now, so I might as well have
some fun with it, right? This is kind of pretty. I kind of like that. This is abstract art that I
would actually hang in my house. Wow, it has depth. It has depth, it has
layers, it has texture. All right, y'all, I'm finished. And you guys are going to
think that I have lost my mind and honestly, I might have. But, here it is.  I wish I could see the look on some of your guys' faces right now. But, okay, clearly, first of all, moment of silence for my hands. I know from experience last time that this does actually
wash off relatively easily, but I had to ditch the gloves. And then I want you to look at my feet. Bruh. I literally... Just, I made the biggest mess. There's so much paint, like just bottles of paint
covering this entire tarp. I started getting paper out, because I had to make
somewhere for me to step, but I was slipping. I just wanna say, clearly
I went for a different, totally different style of painting. Definitely abstract. Still got the color scheme going. And I actually genuinely like this. Like, I'm looking at this
and I'm like this is art. This is art, you know? It has balance, it has a focal point, it has movement, it has
layers, it has texture. I spent hours on it, layering it up and getting the lines to look how I wanted it to look and the balance of how much
of each color I wanted. The only thing I don't like about it is that the gray that it created
is a very cool tone gray, and my house is a more
warm tone color palette so I'm not sure how that's
gonna look in my house 'cause this is overall,
like, very cool-toned. This style of like brush strokey art, I literally have been
looking to buy art like this. Like this is art, okay, I swear. I swear you see stuff like this in stores. Is it exactly like this? Did I do it right? Probably not, but I feel like
this looks like something that could hang on the wall. I'm hopeful. I think what's really,
really gonna set it off is if I can frame it with a black frame to make it look like professional and look like, you know, legit. But overall, I mean, that's art. You can't tell me that that's not art. It might not be your style of art. It might not even be my style of art, but you cannot tell me
that that's not art. And the pour paint, the fluid painting, I'm done, I'm over it, I'm
never doing that again. I'm never doing that again. I've decided I just don't
like that type of art. But, this, this might work. This might actually work, you guys. Stay tuned on this art saga. Stay tuned to see if I get this framed and if it ends up on the wall. Stay tuned. Thanks again to Hawaiian Tropic
for sponsoring this video.
