 hey guys fragmented prepper here I'm just doing a follow up from yesterday like I said I was gonna do one of these everyday similar and the six installment of my vlog on the chroma Barisan and whatnot let me get first order of business out of the way first of all I want to thank everybody who has you know supported me giving me positive feedback likes subscribes comments I love that I love the comments appreciate that the most you know support and stuff like that I want you guys to know that you matter way more to me than any of the negative stuff that I get so I'm just going to get to that for a second there's I spend quite a large number of trolls on this on the previous video that I did a lot of it doesn't even end up into the comments section I'm not a huge YouTube savvy person so I didn't even realize that comments were getting filtered by YouTube itself before they were you know you know being allowed to be posted to the comment section so I discovered that when I was using the desktop site things that were you know flagged as pending or whatever the hell they were saying there's some pretty nasty stuff in there the stuff that you guys say and this this stuff doesn't it doesn't bother me but most of it is completely unrelated to the content that I post a lot of it's completely unrelated to me just just garbage about you know different types of people different groups of people stuff that has literally nothing to do with me or the content or anything and you guys are vile and disgusting I just want you to know that but it doesn't get to me and the stuff that you say you two won't even allow me to put it in the comments section okay otherwise I would sir everyone else can see it and you know judge you for themselves but you guys are all a bunch of keyboard warriors that sit behind your iPhone's and your and your your laptops I want not you say these things and you don't have a picture or a name or anything like that and let's be real those you who that criticize me I'm totally fine but I don't care useful criticism is is is great I love it actually that's where I learned the most just random blanket statements about groups of people or about me personally when you don't know me or about other people that you don't know they don't prove anything except for the fact that you are just you know just kind of sad and pathetic and lonely and have nothing better to do and I can guarantee you that the majority of you who say those things will never say those things to those people in public you wouldn't say that stuff to my face and you wouldn't last more than 10 seconds okay and in this whole thing that's going on if this were to be a huge shtf scenario you ain't gonna hack it you're gonna be the first ones that go so let's just leave that there I wanted to get the negative stuff out of the way so we can move on to some of the other stuff so one of the main things I got from that just to touch on that again is people were calling my video clickbait I hate clickbait I see so many videos by so many channels usually related to prepping whatnot that says every single event is the end of the world every single thing you guys know who those channels are I don't watch them I don't subscribe to them I don't waste my time with them I am NOT one of those people I'm not one of those channels as you can see my channels not even big so it's not like I'm getting engagement from it I'm not making any money I don't have enough viewers or subscribers for any of that yesterday's video is actually the most views I've ever had on any of my videos so I guess along with what the views comes some of the thumbs-down which was more than my thumbs-up and some of the some of the vile disgusting stuff that that comes along with it but I'm not a sensationalist I'm not a clickbait person I think that disinformation is dangerous I want everyone to be informed and be prepared and if that means that you end up being prepared for something that doesn't end up being all that bad then then great you ready for the next thing hey buddy come on no he doesn't look he doesn't make either so the clickbait comments they just they amuse me and like I said I wish they would all just automatically get posted to YouTube so it would be unfiltered and I don't know how to allow that I don't think I can't allow that if anyone has any suggestions to me and how that works let me know because I'm a free speech guy you can say whatever you want I don't really care if YouTube wants to slap you on the wrist for that that's that's their thing I wish it was unfiltered that's just how it goes so just to give a quick update on sort of the national scale according to you know the CDC and the WHL the total number of confirmed cases is like twenty five thousand four hundred something and the total number of deaths was just over three hundred I think was three hundred and seven and this is and they're showing like the numbers increasing really quickly in a short amount of time that's not so much because it is diseases spreading quickly it's because the testing is happening happening more often than the testing kids are more available so actually when I did the math on those numbers that they're giving us I mean I don't know if they're accurate let's say that they're accurate just you know for the sake of this exercise based on those numbers the mortality rate is currently one point two percent and the majority of those people are older or have pre-existing conditions I don't like the idea that people say oh just let the elderly you know die you know whatever I think that's disgusting and horrible just like most of the other stuff I was talked about earlier but I also want people to understand that if you take care of yourself if you're a healthy person if you don't smoke if you're not obese if you have healthy living habits if you don't have diabetes most of these things are preventable things that most people can do and and that's your biggest prophylaxis is is taking care of yourself and that applies to everything in life in general people who don't have you know healthy lifestyles just don't live as long and that's just more exacerbated when you have things like this going on I saw a a news story about a family that had four people that died in a four people in the family that's that's that's terrible for people dying alone family as a realist however by looking at this family they did say that one of the person one of the members had underlying health conditions they said you know they didn't really get into it and the doctor that they were talking to said that you know that it was probably genetics I'm gonna be honest with you the picture that I saw of the people in that family they were all overweight some of them dramatically so and I'm not saying this to on anybody or make anybody feel like crap I'm just saying this to be a realist you need to take care of yourself if you want to live a healthy life period and I know this is going to rub some people the wrong way and it is what it is but I mean that and there's a lot of pros out there and people that I know personally that they have so much gear and so much food put away and water and you name it what they don't exercise they don't take care of themselves and they couldn't bug out if they wanted to and I you know I try to work with them and convinced them that the biggest prep that you have is this and this actually probably this even more so than anything but you know you can only do so much so I'm gonna leave that there I'm sure I'm gonna get some hate comments for that but so be it as I was saying before on that I'm not an alarmist I don't want people to freak out for no reason anyone that knows me and maybe you can tell from my videos some of my viewers that are regulars that I'm trying to get information on I want I want people to get through this I've almost all go through this and the more that people are prepared to better than that that everyone is is better off everyone is if people around me are prepared that's less I have to worry about not only in a sense of security but also in a sense of I don't have to worry about friends or family members or taking care of them if they can take care of themselves and we can all coordinator work together a lot of the preps that I do have and stuff that I've saved up its community-minded is to help out in a disaster situation where people who are unprepared may need some help and I understand that and I'm willing to do that because we need communities and people around us to to make a comeback from something like this even if it's just just a short while and there's a you know things come back up to normal the economics are the economic effects of this is gonna be it's gonna be horrible it's horrible for me already and my family and friends and and it's it's hit a lot of us hard and it's not gonna get better for a long time that I can say without a doubt that the economic effect is undeniable so you guys can argue about the other stuff as far as like the National Guard coming in I haven't seen anything yet I've heard some things but I there's all sorts of stuff out there it's trying to sort through that that radio chatter is is essentially worthless because there's so many different things from so many different sides and angles that it's you know you can't believe anything until you actually see anything unless you have direct evidence of it okay so keep that in mind we're under starting tomorrow at 8 p.m. the entire state of New York is under a non-essential travel non-essential work a shelter-in-place system it's kind of vague as to what that means how they're going to enforce that I know they're probably not going to arrest people because they've been setting people free from prisons here under bail reform for quite a while now and they've been releasing prisoners in general to spread or to spread to reduce the spread of kovat 19 so I don't know what that means we'll see and that's that's all I can only say about it I talked about in my previous video what the possibilities were and if you want to look at that video you can see that for yourselves it's been pretty quiet I think some of the tips I would give to you guys moving forward through this thing if you're in a shelter in place or even if you're not maybe your work hours have been reduced maybe just completely you know laid off I'll keep routine get up like you normally would stay fit hey maybe you're not in the best of shape right now you got plenty of time on your hands you got no excuses for it stay fit exercise like you would maybe even more so help get that stress out stay away from people I guess as much as you can I'm definitely going to do that but there's there's nothing wrong about going outside and even if you got to be just in the yard or if you're in a city area just avoiding people or going out maybe later unless they instance institute a curfew which I heard something about that I'm not sure if that's gonna happen it's a very fluid situation so do that eat healthy as best you can I know some of the the groceries are depleted but it seems that the produce is still moving because people are getting smarter and buying non-perishable stuff so that's still available don't don't try to you know completely cut back from your normal routine pay your bills I know this has been sort of a catch-22 I understand maybe you don't pay a couple bills because you want to save some money or you want to stock up on preps totally understandable but if you do have the one you need to have a surplus paying your bills is gonna help you now because in the long run you're just gonna be more indebted okay so if you can't afford it and you have a reasonable amount of money put away to cushion yourself pay your bills if not I understand that there's more important things I actually got an email today from my insurance company my car insurance company said that they were going to delay any cancellations of auto insurance and home insurance which I thought was very interesting I'm still gonna pay my I heard that cable and internet providers are also going to delay any sort of disconnections for service that in itself has some possibly insidious motivations behind it keeping the TV on so take take from that what you will and that was my other thing don't don't don't stay watching TV all day I know I got sucked into a trap of you know just then I had the news on right now the news but it's paused and you know I kind of got sucked in for you know a couple days at a time just watching stories and looking at everything don't get sucked into that guys there's so many other things you could be doing that we're not all you know totally prepared all the time finish up whatever you got to do or like I said some of the other things you know get out be active and exercise and rec with your family is it says time to you know maybe do some self-improvement maybe do some reading maybe do some hobbies that you wanted to work on for a while things that you wanted to work on with yourself things you wanted to do around the house I mean there are a lot of plus sides to this I know last video I seemed pretty depressing and gloomy and I didn't really mean to come off that way I just wanted to be serious and then after watching the video I was like I was kind of uh that was kind of depressing but I don't filter anything I don't edit anything I just post it as you can tell I don't make any cuts I fumble over words I stutter you know but that's just me that's who I am that's how I am in regular daily life when I interact with people and I want it to be sort of an open conversation with you guys so that being said get your stuff together don't rely on the government to save you don't say oh I'm gonna you know do such-and-such when these when these age sex come in nothing is real until you have it in your hands okay what you have is what you have so I hope this video clarified a few things I hope the trolls keep trolling but more importantly I I love the feedback from you guys I love the support the positive comments that means so much to me and because of that I'm gonna keep doing these videos as long as I can so I hope you guys all stay well and take care of yourselves and take care of each other and I love y'all and I'll be back soon pragmatic prepper out
