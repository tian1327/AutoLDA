  hello good morning everybody it is Monday for me don't know what day it is for you but it's Monday for me I woke up this morning and I was like you know what I want to be productive today we're still in quarantine again don't know when you guys are gonna be watching this but I'm assuming everyone's still in quarantine we're in quarantine right now and some days are better than others as far as productivity goes in so today I want to be very very productive it's funny that I say I want to be really really productive as I woke up my late in bed for probably an hour and a half just scrolling Instagram watching Instagram stories but days not over it is 10:00 a.m. I'm gonna be productive actually I've made it to do this which is crazy because I'm not really a to-do list person but you know what I was like let me just write down everything that I need to do and so I figure let's go on a productive day and a quarantine life I still am working I have work and stuff that I need to do and I still need to work out I need to organize my house because what you cannot see and this is not my house is disgusting and the floors are absolutely horrific I will not show you those because they're scary genuinely scary they're so bad and my bedroom needs to be vacuumed just I my closet I'll show you my closet and my closets really really really scary it's bad so we're just gonna get our stuff together today I figured we would go ahead and do that you already saw me waking up and making my body bloom I'll do anything seriously does body bloom is a premium probiotic you just think every day I'll put your hair skin nails digestion apparently his deal I love my girl Sarah when I drink that I don't really see a difference in my hair nails and skin truly I mean also that just comes by the fact that I haven't washed my face in like three days I know I know I'm gross some days are just harder than others came does a real life this is a real day in the life so full disclosure haven't washed my face in a couple days and my hair yes is that a ponytail but technically I think if I took the ponytail out I don't think my hair would move should probably shower on my to-do list honestly that's where we're at guys I've dried shower and wash my face on a to-do list so happy quarantine huh oh about body but back to I was saying I don't really notice a difference in my hairs in her nails but I definitely do notice in my digestion it definitely helps start that morning if you know what I'm saying um so hey Briana yeah we know exactly what you mean because you said it there's one thing about starting a YouTube channel or just even recording yourself in general you learn one how annoying you are when you talk to how bad you are telling stories and just how stupid you sound honestly like oh you know what I'm saying yes we know exactly what you're saying there was no reading in between the lines there after I drink that it's like every day which is great because that's healthy you need to have healthy bowels now honestly I'm just watching YouTube right now and I'm gonna give myself like another 20 minutes of YouTube and then we're gonna crack and I'm probably gonna do things out of orders day usually I wake up I work out the chill for a second I shower I get ready that I work but I think what I'm gonna do is I woke up I'm gonna chill right now and then I think I'm gonna do some work and then I'm gonna work out and then I'm going to get all of my cleaning all that stuff done I think not totally sure we'll see  going to work out I'm finally going to work out I was working for seven awesome I love feels like a 10 and the wave and you know you can hear me because of the wind but right by people's houses yeah anyway I've been working for the past couple of hours and I just really need to move my body and it's nice well it's kind of nice outside a little bit cold but it'll be fine and figured I would just work out outside and I'm happy that I'm actually working out because honestly I didn't think I was going to today but productive Monday we're gonna do it so but I realized I feel like I bit off a little bit more than I could chew when it comes to all the things that I wanted to do today because I just had a bigger workload and the days just go by so fast when you're in quarantine I feel like I don't know I can't be the only one I feel this is only true when you don't have kids but they just go by so freaking fast and it's frustrating anyway I'm all that to say I am going to go ahead and I'm going to work out I am now on week five upstairs day so I just read it and it's slightly shorter so here we go I look so bad so bad so Haggard again wash your face friends and okay let's do it  did work out here's the thing is that I liked who wasn't really in it like that that much I definitely could have gone harder that's something that's just really frustrating is when I get in my head and I'm like oh I just don't really want to do this I don't really want to do this like I'm gonna keep on going and then I keep on going like not 100% it and so it's definitely a goal of mine is to even when I don't want to do it still try to give it 100% that's definitely something that I'm not the best at and like doing things halfway and I don't want to do that because I want to see results and different goals and different things like that and just my overall health and just like a mindset you don't want to continue to I don't know go at things halfway I always want to be 100% and so it's definitely something that I want to keep on pushing myself to do but at least I worked out at least I did it I don't want to Bagon myself for all of the negatives at least I got up and at least I worked out what's honestly I didn't really think I was going to today I said just working out in the morning is just what fits me definitely I am NOT a afternoon or night person when it comes to working out and so I think even if I can get any of you guys advice set yourself up for success for me waking up in the morning and working out that's the best time for me to work out because I know that I have a lot to do when it comes to work I want to spend time with Spencer I honestly like having downtime though in the middle of the day where I can just sit and chill for at least an hour just to relax and not really do anything play on my phone or go watch youtube watch an episode of Criminal Minds and love Criminal Minds by the way it's literally my favorite show of all time um but yeah so just set yourself up for success like today I didn't really set myself up for sick like I didn't have that good of a workout which is frustrating but I knew what I was doing to myself and I didn't just get up and workout instead I was watching YouTube and playing on my phone which that's on me but I still worked out at least I did it and that's something that I should be proud of okay anyway I think I'm gonna go on a walk with Spencer and maybe Autzen I'm so sorry about this wind if you can hear if you can even hear me I don't know what we're doing for the rest today honestly I just probably make dinner and just show I could do some more work Ramona could you oh my god I need this in my house oh my god duh I have literally so much stuff so you can watch me clean anyway okay I'm gonna go ahead and go upstairs the hardest part about the workout is do I take the stairs back up to the apartment should I take the elevator I always try to take the stairs sometimes doesn't happen but again didn't go that hard and roll it down so stairs it is okay so I'm still really grubby haven't showering so that's what I'm doing right now and then I'm gonna go ahead and do some laundry but I still have a lot to do so again bit off a little bit more than I can chew we have a nice shower just so good oh my gosh my hair is so like matted oh it's bad you may think I'm gonna FaceTime my sister see what she's doing she's not good answer ignored okay well I'm gonna FaceTime if I'm Lexie them okay hey listen I tried yogurt ransom through the UM yeah I was like okay I'm not gonna get some - okay we're gonna clean my room no see my closet because I'm a just bad it's been oh hi I see oh god he's so cute it freaking hurts sometimes but no he doesn't really know where to start I'm thinking you're not he's illiterate I'm sure you can probably actually hear him sniffing the camera anyway hi first let's separate this doesn't need to be washed hard because like I have a pile of clothes this that I'm trying to sell either on Poshmark well I have a pas spark which I guess I can leave that linked if anybody wants to look at my Poshmark um good stuff it's like Orencia and Nordstrom and different things like that so it's definitely good stuff but I
