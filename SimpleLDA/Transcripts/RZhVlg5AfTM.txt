 hi guys welcome to the vlog today is my 25th birthday and I'm celebrating from my quarantine life social distancing so we're celebrating at home I am lucky enough to live with my family so my parents gave me a birthday card super cute my boyfriend stopped in and gave me a card a cake and flowers and a gift and lots of snacks and I just feel really loved and appreciated I'm getting so many phone calls and just messages and well wishes and I think that this is my favorite birthday so far we're about to have cake my mom made this cake with my sister's then everybody's tea still got to pour some in there Shh good morning you guys today is one of the first days that it's like sunny outside and it's just such a joy to look out the window I am so happy but today I wanted to do kind of an at-home photo shoot sort of I bought a balloon that are like the number balloons for my birthday and I've been just waiting for a sunny day so today I'm going to boules them up as I haven't done that in forever I don't know just being at home and not having to go anywhere really like it doesn't motivate me to do my makeup or like it glam unless I'm like filming so anyways I'm going to go follow a Scott Barnes tutorial to do my makeup sort of I did that for my birthday last year and I'm probably gonna like straighten her comb my hair so I've totally been addicted to tick-tock and everyone is doing this like whipped coffee need two tablespoons of like instant coffee two tablespoons of hot water and two tablespoons of sugar but my god that's a lot of sugar for me I don't put sugar in my coffee I usually just throw in creamer so I'm gonna do a lot less but seriously look how beautiful this day is and the clouds are moving across the sky gonna start with Taster's Choice a French Roast I don't know how much you want to put in I got powdered sugar and I'm waiting for my hot water got my glass of ice need to add my milk in there that seems like a lot I'll add a tablespoon and a half but that seems like a lot I'm just gonna match it I'm gonna make a little less and then we wait I'm gonna add my can I help you what what do you need I can't go outside with you right now Joe Bonnie oat and then a splash of color it started off whipped but I added more water and I think it got a little too foamy  okay so see when you do the foaming at like an angle it comes to be like this mousse like it's literally not coming out right the first time I added too much water so it's just this foam that is still moving and that's what it looks like because I made two of the coffee I put them all together it's not have a really strong cup of coffee the Moosey one i originally tried was really good i did feel like it was just I don't know I would either put creamer or how we put the sugar you know I didn't like both of them too much in there but then all together it's really strong we added some more milk to it and I'm just kind of sipping on it but that's life right all right so I finished the makeup and I just did my nails on live with you guys I am happy with the makeup the hair I just curled but it like all fell apart I don't care as long as it has like some sort of texture to it I did not self tan so I look kind of wonky I can't pick up this little fuzz um I look a little crazy because my hands don't match anything in a row anyways I need to bring my camera downstairs we are going in to take pictures with this big guy it's currently 4:30 so not fun the Sun is already basically setting gotta get these photos finished and done with I'm excited having done photos and hot minute  get the best of you   all right it is really late all of a sudden I like don't even know where the day went so this vlog is going into tomorrow I'm so sorry it is currently 1222 I don't know where the time line I was gonna film a video um because I did the photo shoot today and I got a solid like five or six really good photos if you want to see them they're gonna be post only instagrams then go check out its I am just olena um I love photography I wish I could duplicate myself and do my own photos and videos but it's hard so I did all those photos using my phone as the remote and connecting it to my camera so I did my best I did what I could and I'm happy with the ones that I got there was a lot of them that weren't that good though but it's okay we're working on our hobbies I'm hoping that you guys are experimenting and trying out hobbies and seeing what you do because there's this tweet going around that said like I didn't realize my my top 3 hobbies were going out like spending money and like eating out or something like that and I think that a lot of us spend our time trying to fill it with things that seem like they're you know social and fun and I guess like you know going out to eat going to like Target t.j.maxx like how did Target and TJ Maxx become a personality trait that's what I want to know but they did and even now I realized like I get the craving to go and I'm like why don't I ever get the craving to like read a book or like paint a painting you know and so I'm really trying to develop my hobbies and like become more than just a workaholic and a Shopaholic so yeah that's what I'm doing my room is a complete and utter mess this morning I woke up and it was perfectly clean now it's a mess because I put on a bunch of different outfits for the photos and cuz I was like lazy I threw them on the ground but it's it's mostly pillows and blankets on the ground though so I think that after I make my bed will be fine I just had a cup of tea and then I have my giant thing of iced water where the ice already melted but I've been drinking a giant one of these every night and I realized that it's probably the dumbest thing I could do because then I can't go to sleep because every like ten minutes I have to pay I should probably reschedule my giant jug of water for the day it should be in the morning I know someone's gonna ask me about my lip color I'm actually really loving it and I'm pretty impressed with its staying power um let me show you what it is please hold uh I forgot I have to take off all my makeup this is from Laura Mercier it's called power it's one of their little extreme um velour matte lipsticks I lost a faint like a mail somewhere in my bed my friend and I are playing the like in your messages you can go and get game Pidgeon I hope you guys can see it and in game Pidgeon right now we're playing this game called reverse eye so I have to do my move I don't know how to play this game I literally just click things until it makes sense I love these lipsticks I actually have them on my vanity counter because I always want to remember to use them I had them in a drawer for a while and I didn't use them as often and I'm so bummed because they are so amazing they have like a little sharpener on the one side which I totally forgot to use today I was trying to line my lip and it could have been so much easier but they're pretty much just sticks I don't know why I'm going into such detail with this lip color um with my Genki nail god help us so that's what it looks like and they are really pigmented they last well and they apply super easy I don't really have like a lot of neutral colors I brought fun colors down because I wanted to experiment with fun colors and photography because I'm always so like nervous that I'm not gonna like myself with a dark red lip or any type of dark lip especially a cream I always wear like liquid lipstick but I applied this one really quick and I I like the way that it looks I'd even use a lip liner isn't that nuts that's crazy but I want to do more like photo shoot type things so maybe I'm gonna focus on like makeup photo shoots I know today it's motivation was the balloons because I bought balloons from Party City which I recommend if you are celebrating a birthday it just makes it more festive and it feels like you're actually celebrating something so yeah I got like a little set to show you guys so there's this little set that has a light gold colors I was like these confetti ones which are super cute and then one of my gold ones popped and then I got the numbers so that's cute it's like a fun little Bay to get um you're like birthday pictures this is what mine turned out like wait how cute is that dorable I just love making sure that things are still celebrated even if it's just a little bit cuz not everyone's gonna have like a mom who is going to bake them a cake and whatever I like my mom went above and beyond she even asked me what to make for like dinner and lunch I was like literally like whatever you want like I don't really care um my parents were like a week or two before they were like which we order you for your birthday before they like stop shipping everything and I couldn't even decide like I I wanted one thing instead like specifically which actually I ordered myself um I wanted the impressions vanity for my office which if you guys don't know what it is it's basically a light-up mirror that you can dim I have like a vanity that I like made from just bathroom light fixtures and a mirror from like Home Depot so it's not like super exciting but it's worked for like five years but I don't I don't really want that anymore I want like something that's like a little bit more cute so I was initially gonna get like a small one like this cuz I have the same exact table so that's how it would look but because they're having a sale right now I ended up getting the one that stretches the entire width of the table I have another picture right here so it's gonna look like that I can hang it on the wall or I can place it on the table but it just looks a lot more like professional and I think that I can like film get ready with me um with it regardless I please the order because they had a sale and with the sale price I was more comfortable buying it because I don't know I just I like didn't want to give up like nobody that they wanted like without the sale price but I ordered it cuz I was like I don't know if it's gonna go on sale again at anytime soon so we'll see I just know that like I watched a video and someone said that like California can't ship right now because of the virus so I don't know if I'm like gonna get it anytime soon but there is no rush I mean I know every company right now me it's like support so even if I place my order now and I get it like a few months later I don't really care um but I'm just excited that I kind of like put my little checkmark next to that so whatever that comes I'll put it together on the vlog but yeah I'm just trying to like put things together the way that I like it you know okay I need to like stop procrastinating to talk to you guys I don't have to clean my room but I really have to clean my room and I have to glue my nail back on because we can't be living like this I'm wearing pants that are too long for me right now I don't think eyes can tell but like literally they're too long and I've been tripping over them all day and I'm doing it just because I was wearing them for the photo and now it's like I should just change into like my pajama pants but I don't know I've been laying here for two hours now on tick tock and playing this this from this game I didn't even know like you could play games with your like I mean I knew you could play games with your friends you didn't know the lake you could play so many games so yeah if you guys are interested in these lipsticks I'll leave a link down below for you I'll leave some of my favorite colors probably also mention them on my Instagram because a lot of people asked about my lip color it's pretty I like this one a lot it's actually I feel like that's such an amazing name too like I'm wearing power this morning I put power on my lips I love that alright actually realize that those videos probably really long so I'm gonna end it here thank you so much for watching the vlog I know it was probably kind of like boring and weird and all over the place but that's kind of what quarantine is nowadays so welcome to my crazy life I will see you in the next vlog I love you buy me a drink email okay bye
