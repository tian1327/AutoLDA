 hey guys so here I am this is my attempt to vlog I was kind of like when you guys told me that I wanted to see a vlog oh boy I was just kind of like man I don't know because my life is pretty boring as you guys know like I'm not working right now so I'm basically a pregnant homebody so there's nothing really interesting going on but I'm gonna try my best to just genuinely show you guys what life looks like in this house since there's nothing really going on today I don't think I'm still gonna kind of leave the camera on but I think I'm gonna like vlog throughout the days throughout the week right now it is a Tuesday and yesterday my family threw me well most of my friends threw me and like a surprise ritual baby shower so I'm gonna go ahead and     okay so Stephanie and our I break my phone then allocate our my treatment all defended half-time for yourselves when baby comes as my sister L extend the baby met came to the world because of YouTube and so you guys are already there and so please leave seeing how Prime Minister that's number one and number two to Sesame when I have my friends baby I love I thought it was all mine so I won't ask any help access that I will say so please ask for help and and also I need my wife   but yeah so just to show you guys I wake up really late now I am very pregnant and I like sleep like I just sleep because during the night I can be up for hours and baby keeps me up so I will wake up around like 10 so by that time the day is really late so actually right now I am in my kitchen um I usually like to stay in my room but you know sometimes like if I want to be productive especially like with content creating I I like try I like to change scenery so this is our kitchen we've been here for like eight months now we're still working on like decor and everything but this is a little tour of our kitchen one word whenever we're like done decorating and stuff I will do a house tour but this is our living room so you guys welcome in to our little living room and as you guys can see they decorated our living room so so well we live in like a little town house it's very small and just perfect for us and then this area of our which is like the foyer I guess I guess it's technically not a foyer so as you guys can see the house is a bit of a mess but that's real life but I got this little board from I think I got it from Hobby Lobby so I really like to like put scriptures on here or just declarations over the house on here so in the month of April I put like please let it cheese in this house I've been like that but yeah so then I guess this is this angle of our house so definitely liked this video if you guys will want to see like a full house tour whenever we're done decorating Hey look who's here my husband and he's really busy right now so anytime he comes out of his office I am a happy girl what I feel like sometimes it's like pressing in by that's not a funny Germany so those front of me because they break me that I thought right you were like it guys should I prank him like should I do like all my water broke prank on him very easy nice I told him I know I told myself I would never do that to him because he's just so sweet and cute no I can't do that to you what we're not really a pranking type of house what kind of prank would you do I'm wrong yeah yeah he knows I don't like that enema oh I can't even like scary noise that would be that would actually be twenty that wouldn't be floating above it but that's better than like me walking and you're like rah or good morning and I get a dummy and then put escape isn't it yeah that is so evil but your husband is still in bed right  there you go I'm so happy literally I had I had one on my on my registry but no thank you guys so so much    no no like Feliz then it was some good see you guys happy thank you for opening that so it looks like my sister sent me some stuff to which I was not expecting I literally just opened the door and there's two packages I read works so I'm gonna open this one this is from my sister who would show you guys the actual baby clothes but if I do then I'll give away the gender but she basically got us a whole bunch of baby clothes I'm excited and happy because I barely bought baby stuff so alright guys that's it day I might vlog a little bit more as the night goes on  Oh  oh this me Oh  this is me  holy speed laughs can i have cocoa puffs please yes thank you baby I love you I'm actually not enjoying  so I'm about to text him what I want yo you guys this great planner I got it it's called the prayerful planner I got it I found them on Instagram and I've been using it all year and it's really helped me to just stay productive but you know with being pregnant I really have to like give myself grace and give myself patience so what I love about the planner is that it has a section for priorities and then like your tasks to get done and then you have a poster and prayer journal and of course that you can put oh so annoying okay so of course you can put whatever you want on here but I love like the prayer journal portion and then I absolutely love like each day there's a Bible verse so yeah there's a Bible verse right here and says so faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of Christ I love that but yeah so I guess I can show you guys I don't always write in the prayer journal part but I love it where I get to like kind of pour my heart out to the Lord so I have this place I can't hear you that I will  hey guys so I just wanted to do a check-in I'm currently in my bathroom I just showered and I put something nice on so I have not been feeling my best today I've literally been in bed for most of the day as you guys can see your girl is just feeling all the pregnancy feels so there hasn't really been anything to vlog because I had like all these things planned to do today but I just want to check in to let you guys know the reality of trying to do content creation and trying to be pregnant and be present around the house it's very very difficult alright guys so I came downstairs for the first time today in hours and I wasn't really expecting a package so I'm really excited to see what it is and literally just when I thought that just when I thought we got all the baby stuff like there's just random things coming but it's just made this whole pregnancy super super exciting so you guys are about to see me open this package hopefully it's not too heavy it's like I'm okay let's see what we got here for baby Hammond meaning the nipple cream because baby baby is going to be I've heard so much about breastfeeding and how it can hurt also got these which is a super super huge blessing um distort breast milk I'm so happy about this nipple cream because believe it or not have not purchased nipple cream yet surprisingly who is this from oh my gosh I cannot I can't I can't deal like this is from our friends Prince and Deena literally they sent us us I received a package from them yesterday already I can't believe they sent us more stuff oh my goodness okay so they got baby a little pump tummy time cleaner this is so adorable so so adorable so yeah guys that's what I received I'm so excited for the baby it is a scary new territory but God has like really really blessed us we've barely had to buy anything on our own for this baby so receiving all this stuff is such a blessing probably later on you guys will actually see like a baby haul video where I'll show you guys like all the stuff that I that I purchased and then I'm also thinking about doing like what's in my hospital bag video like a lot of baby content so if you guys would be interested in that definitely put the little baby emoji in the comments so  so usually like when my heart is overwhelmed and like there's just so much going on I love to worship I love normally I put on worship music or or whatever and so I know someone was asking because I always say like I try to bring God into like my daily activities so that's one of the ways I bring God and if I'm cleaning the house if I'm washing dishes if I am cooking like better believe I need the Word of God playing I need worship music playing I'm in this case I'm just singing to the Lord because I just I need that in my life I don't know about you guys if you guys do this as well let me know in the comments how do you incorporate God into your day do you resonate with this like let me know let's talk but yeah I'm gonna go back to my singing won't you come come on like you promised pour out your spirit pour I'll speak won't you come won't you      okay  mauriz nothing related blog how is it it's good I didn't like the sauce that much I think I would like yeah the other marinara one but yeah guys so I'm logging off for today maybe we'll see but just in case I do this vlog is coming to a close we are what do we have a night routine we don't really have a night time routine I
