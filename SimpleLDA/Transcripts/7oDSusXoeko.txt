 good morning it's day one of my fist show according to you not going into the office anyway I am my office is closed I'll be working from home all week and therefore going to work out I don't know when the lights turn on I'm gonna work out I'm going to make sure you move every day I might work up twice and might do my walk and my leg workout and then also do a walk maybe later we'll see I've seen him doing the daily vlog but I'm thinking I'll just keep up my weekly so all right I oh I'm gonna show you and I'm wearing padding with my friend I met a friend she also does peloton we were doing the same workout one day and she's like excuse me is this you and found my username it was really cute okay so anyways I'm going to show you my new pants these are the high wasted power Vita 7/8 camo by Athleta they're very soft I kind of wore them all day yesterday now I'm wearing them to work out and then I'm gonna wash it so I'm gonna get on the treadmill to a leg workout and then get to work well shower and sort of get ready I'm gonna try and do a little bit of makeup everyday just so a little bit of OC so I'm working from home during the credit virus outbreak and when we think will you go outside well if you can tell it just started snowing in Chicago fantastic there we go perfect timing for a little snow its March by the way snowing and March definitely not going outside for a walk I'm glad I already worked out today I am going to I'm just in between work calls I have quite a few of these and then I'm trying to figure out what my next next project is for organizing because this vlog this week is pretty much gonna be done from my one-bedroom apartment I'm working from home with your second if I get out there elsewhere you come home supposin its own instead of challenges as far as like we're both on calls so I think I'm gonna go up to like the communal space on the rooftop soon just so that we don't like disturb each other this isn't funny both your boyfriend's staring at me so we just got a notice from our building they're closing all the common areas that includes the gym it includes the other common areas that I was planning I'm working in and I think maybe the coffee luckily I have my coffee carts so we've literally combined to a one-bedroom apartment and maybe the hallway so it's very possible tomorrow morning I will be doing walking lunges down the hallway we shall see so day one quarantine has been interesting we've been very busy at work and now it's after work hours so I'm gonna work on my channel I was just kind of deciding what to eat so what we're doing is a very weird angle but what we're doing that's my boyfriend takes a nap is to order takeout while the restaurants are still open for takeout because obviously there's a chance that restaurants could completely close and not even do takeout so wondering if we need to like just order in and then what are these kids walking across the field and then save the food that we have for when grocery store for when like things are gonna close if they close we don't know so I have to decide that now I'm just rambling mostly because I've been in the same apartment for like two days now so it's really cold out or I would go for hey Google what's the weather like but the feels-like is whatever I am just going to work on my channel I'm a video to upload for tomorrow and catch up on my DVR'd shows good morning it's quarantine day to officially it's Tuesday and the gym is closed and I was gonna do a workout on my TV but I'm not yes I did put self time tan around last night it said I'm painting my nails and first I need to take off the dark colors of my fingers and my toes which are red and I was watching tic toc video or YouTube not sure and it said to put lotion around your nails and then did you come off and like knock it all over your skin and so we're given that shot also after that I'm gonna go he have the shower because let me do with his hair and get on with my work day it's interesting like I feel like the day won by very quickly yesterday I was really busy at work so that really helped so yeah I hope you're staying busy and healthy and we're gonna probably keep saying that but let me get to this and see if this works I'll keep you posted I put the lotion here and now I don't have all the purple around here that's pretty cool neat trick so find the out for a walk where I mean he's had not because I'm a nice man but because I thought the hell is cute it's really cold out make sure more layers but oh well first time I've been outside in two days there's what if you people out and have to send active streets we're doing some people are ready so we're just gonna walk maybe to the river and then back yeah very exciting day good morning it's Wednesday day 3 of being quarantined which is ironic because I'm outside I decided I need to go for a walk first thing in the morning I brought my coffee thing to a podcast I'm going for that walk I'm gonna walk through the Gold Coast buy all the stores that are clothes that I can't go into and yeah I think I'm just gonna walk for like half hour come back and then get ready I'm trying to treat this as normal as possible because if I don't I lose my mind and also it's gonna be really hard to get back into a schedule when I have to start like going into the office again so that's my theory hope you're doing well and I'm gonna get going and listen to my podcast also it's not warm out which is why all the layers on but I'm ready for it this time I'm like yesterday's walk oh and it's gonna rain in like a few hours so I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get out and third time today alright I'm gonna stop rambling continue one of my walk you didn't even occur to me to show my TV's mostly because I'm wearing at leisure I'm wearing this top from Athleta from a while ago and these Lululemon joggers the long ones they're so comfy and then I have my vinyasa scar from Lululemon which my boyfriend thinks is hilarious that I have an indoor scarf I just think it makes me feel cozy so this is what I'm wearing today um the other days which again I'm sorry I didn't show have been very much the same they're usually leggings and a top and this scarf pretty much every day all right things I got delivered in the mail today uh-huh I got some espresso things but I also got not this white shirt this blazer here it should look familiar I had it on last week in Navy and since I was helping my girl sandy out during the 10% off at Nordstrom I had to order this for me and oatmeal and I'm loving it and I have nothing like it also nor chum no as 25% off I don't know for how long or fill me over the times log posts but you can get this for 25% off or anything else at lunch um so check it out I'm loving this by the way it's super stretchy and comfy good morning I am on a morning walk it's really cloudy but that's the one power I'm walking intuition Avenue I've decided that a morning walk is exactly what I need it's our little aggressive and I don't think I'm the only one it's not like it's basic about but they're people yes I forgot to tell you about this guy he was literally social distancing himself from anyone that came within like 10 feet of him and he was like dodging on the sidewalk I thought it was really funny so anyway going for this walk I have my coffee and then oh no on Michigan Avenue I'll show you some sight you also yes he did put self tanner on last night because I just need a little pick-me-up okay the clouds or the fog is so crazy today but you can barely see uh-huh you can barely see the tablet let's get shopping online man all right let me show you Hancock disappeared it's gonna rain again today out from my walk now still cold out totally ok with that it's crazy all these stores have signs on that like that they're closed which makes sense but a lot of people out for bunnies again for my walk assume looking like a crazy person while I talk to my phone so in this podcast I will actually link it below because I'm really loving it is about neuroscience and anxiety and sleeping and all this stuff it's really good so I'll link it below if you want to give it a listen these pigeons uh and if I have a note II probably back on later to show I am making the Watts gobby cooking cookies and I'm very excited because I got a scale like the kitchen scale and this recipe calls for like ounces and I was converting it to cups and it was just like a whole thing so this horse amazed in the scale so I'm thinking these cookies I don't know if they could taste any better but maybe when you have a scale they do so I'll make them today just Thursday and then I'll bake them on Sunday so you'll see them in next week's blog I'm just glad I have all the ingredients also I never really get to eat all the cookies someone else my house eats most of them but that's ok Spacek yeah it's amazonbasics I'll put the link below in case you're interested in it so I'm leaving the house to go for a walk and I wanted to show you I'm wearing these leggings from Athleta a sweatshirt from Berlin my big coat my fanny pack oh my golden goose snakes I put earrings on today to make myself feel better so Rome for a walk picking up some essentials and coming right back I'm probably one of the only people who is wearing makeup and sort of did their hair I actually air dried it and then flattened the bottom or the ends of it anyway I just shot a bunch of videos a couple for tick-tock one for YouTube and one for IG TV so I'm editing this now and I'm editing this vlog so I am going to call it for the week thank you for watching stay healthy I will be back tomorrow for the next week's vlog and will do my best to just kind of capture different
