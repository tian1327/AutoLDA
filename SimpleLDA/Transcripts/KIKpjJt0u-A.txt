 two weeks what two weeks we're not going anywhere two weeks at least we are not gonna spread this virus hi everybody good morning welcome back to my channel if you're new here thanks for joining if you already subscribe thank you so so much today is crazy man so we're currently in the midst of preparing to be in social isolation for two weeks because the corona virus or the kovat 19 is spreading really rapidly in New Jersey so we live in New Jersey and as a precaution we decided we're not going to go anywhere for the next two weeks so we need to prepare by getting everything we need for two weeks and we is gonna be working from home for two weeks so his company's already said like everybody has to stay home and not come to the office they're gonna lock the whole building down so they can't even go there and he's gonna work from home I'm obviously already home and so we last night we made a shopping list he was gonna go shopping last night but he was too tired so he just went this morning early he's still there he said he's in the line but he said it's so crazy it's like 8 o'clock in the morning and there was already a jillion people there and they had no meat they had no chicken or almost no chicken he said one person came out with it with one package of chicken and that somebody was already waiting for it so they had like no chicken no pork no beef and like yeah so I don't even know when he comes home I'll have him update us and tell us his experience there but I know everybody's buying like crazy stuff just because they all are doing the same thing is us they're not gonna go anywhere so they feel like they need to have everything we ordered diapers and wipes online so those are coming tomorrow and we're gonna order some stuff from the pharmacy as well so that we have everything we need like her vitamins and my medicines and things so we want to make sure we have everything so we don't need problems any baby and then we're literally just gonna stay home for two weeks going anywhere so it's insane because there was a death in New Jersey and yeah I know that the virus is not like deadly for young people like us and I don't think kids or babies have gotten it at all so look at you but we don't want to contribute to the spread of it so that's why we're staying home because if we got it and then we contaminate somebody else and then it would just make everything worse so we're trying our best to do what we should be doing in this scenario which is to stay home and stay away from people and not help with the spread of the virus so I know some people think it's overreacting but I don't think it is I think that I mean obviously we're not like scared or like oh my god the virus is gonna kill everybody but we are doing what we need to do which is to stay home and and think about others not just ourselves so it's gonna suck because I don't like staying home already you guys know I've already been feeling crazy being at home and now I'm gonna be home even more but at least we will be home because I was getting nervous he was taking the train to work every day so I would literally make him take a shower and put his clothes in the washer as soon as he got home cuz I didn't want any virus spreading so now at least he doesn't have to go to work but he's been in the grocery store all morning so hopefully he's okay I'll give you guys update when he gets home someone's down for tummy's time you can do with my baby you can do it mommy's gonna help you yeah gonna help you mommy so hungry I can't we did breakfast mmm I'm hungry there see she

doing all that I know go ahead I'll put this away okay and take a shower Wow  run downstairs because we went to the bank to get money and to get gas and then he's coming home and then we're officially not going anywhere at all but I was literally holding her I just finished breastfeeding I was not dressed I just quickly through this robe on because they rang the doorbell because the drugstore delivers so I got my medicine delivered I think I might have mentioned that I was going to do that so I forgot it was coming and then I had to like jump up and run down here to put a robe on and run down with a baby but I am getting her ready I'm just gonna take her picture because she's wearing something super cute so let me put her headband on and then I'll show you her current outfit look at her oh my gosh she has her kiddy onesie on and then I got these pants at Baby Gap and also I got these at H&M these little socks so this is her outfit for today she's so cute I know we're not going anywhere but it's just fun to dress her up at home now and take her pictures yeah because if you have all these cute clothes and then you never wear them then that's so sad so I'm gonna take a few pictures for her to send to Vietnam to our family all right this is our preparedness we are ready we are prepared we have plenty of things to eat look at this yeah yeah  yeah oh my god we're good do you think we have enough food I don't know she's crying I gotta go have the Baby Whisperer here I can never get her to sleep I'm so glad you're here he comes in he swoops in he swaddles her and within what 3 minutes she's sleeping meanwhile I struggle every time so I'm now finally gonna have my lunch just because daddy came to the rescue otherwise I would still be up there holding there trying to get her to go to sleep but yes do you think we're stocked up and ready are you done stalking are we ready he's gonna go back out one more time to get condensed milk and turtle chips and then that's it two weeks what two weeks we're not going anywhere two weeks at least we are not gonna spread this virus this is crazy so I'm making a meal a random meal of having macaroni and cheese along with these little pork sausages I got in the Korean market and then a bowl of fresh mango mmm it smells good so that's my lunch for today all right it's time for dinner so I'm just making some broccoli with leftovers so we have some fried chicken Korean fried chicken that we had yesterday so we're gonna finish that so we have a little bit here I'm just gonna heat up in the oven I'm gonna roast broccoli and then I have some leftovers from lunch and I'm gonna cook up these top and then we have rice into rice cooker so that's gonna be our dinner for today a meal made with leftovers yeah look at your toys and stop crying so we're gonna eat it's the next day I am so bored because he has been sleeping all morning so last night he said he had a scratchy throat he wasn't sure if like he was actually getting sick or if he's just worried because of all the madness around the virus so I told him scratchy throat isn't really a thing for coronavirus it's more like the coughing and the fever and he didn't have a fever last night so anyways he even if he's just getting a cold he decided he wanted to sleep downstairs in the guest room so he took nyquil and he slept downstairs and then this morning he came up here at like 7:15 and he was only up here for like an hour and he was like falling back asleep so I don't let me just quote a bit so he went back down and he's been sleeping ever since it's now after 1:00 o'clock so I was hoping he'd be awake because I want him to watch her while I make lunch so she's actually been sleeping a lot today is well she did tummy time this morning intense tummy time she was literally making me put my hands like this and they're near her foot and then she would press her foot on my hands and propelled herself across the blanket it was insane and she just kept doing it she didn't want to stop it's like so crazy how she really likes doing these things and she does it so much and then she gets really tired after so she fell asleep after that I had given her feed and she fell asleep on me in the rocking chair and I just let her stay there she was chill and then after that I stood up you know trying to get going around here and she was ready for another feed so I fed her and then she fell asleep again at while I was holding her so I just put her in her bed I didn't even swaddle her because her swaddles are too small now so we're waiting Monday then no one's coming I only ordered one because I want to make sure it fits her and it works before I go gung-ho ordering a bunch cuz yeah these ones it's so weird these swaddle me swaddles they're size small medium like small / medium the next size up is large and a bunch of people said it was too big for their child and when I looked on like somebody had a video of them using the large on they're like 5 month old Buddha baby so definitely would be way too big for her so it's kind of a struggle right now she still needs to be swaddled at night to sleep so we still put it on her it just it's it's kind of tight like I I know you're not supposed to put like a tight swaddle on them but it's only for two more days and then she'll have a normal one it's still fine like I didn't put my fingers in it but I just feel bad like putting her in it but she sleeps well with a swaddle if you don't swaddle her she'll just be flailing her arms and making noise all night but yeah I don't know what we're gonna do today since we're not going anywhere we're stuck at home for this social distancing so something I didn't talk about yesterday when I was walking we're trying not to like give in to like the panic of everything but we're just also trying to be smart so yeah we've bought a lot of groceries but that's because we're not going anywhere we're not gonna help with the spread of this virus I'm not going to contribute to that so we're staying home for at least two weeks maybe three we'll see how things play out in this country so far there has been like I think 51 cases in New Jersey and one death so and and three cases have been within like a five-mile radius of our house so that's kind of scary and that's why we're not going anywhere anymore hopefully everything's sort itself out and if everybody is doing social distancing hopefully it slows the spread and we can tane it but until then we're staying home so I don't even want to like go out for her walk like normally I take her for a walk and I'm just like so scared didn't even do that so we'll have to find ways to entertain ourselves she doesn't really need much entertainment today because she's sleeping it's crazy she's usually awake for a few hours in the morning but I guess she's just really tired from her exercise so anyways I think I'll just end this vlog here because I think it's gonna be a very boring day tomorrow we'll have her go swimming again so maybe I'll blog tomorrow I think she's gonna like that so give this video a thumbs up if you liked it tell me in the comments how you're doing with the coronavirus what are you guys doing are you staying home are you ignoring it and just going on with your life because I know some people are doing that which teach their own I don't think it's a good idea to do that but let me know what you guys are doing hopefully everybody stays safe and yeah I'll see you guys in the next video
