  hey you guys welcome back to my channel is your girl Sydney sizzle set the kid and I am back at it again with another video today i am doing a tutorial on how to get your eyebrows from looking like this shout to looking like this i filled it in and i've added more of an arch to the brow as you can see here since we've been in quarantine my eyebrows I've just been doing whatever and I've tried to I guess keep them arch to keep them well manicured but it's really not cutting it I feel my friends always ask me like how do I do my eyebrows so this is pretty much a step-by-step on how I do them of course like if you are just looking to fill in your eyebrows and keep it pushin not including any makeup then be very careful when you add the concealer because as you can see right now I do have that like lighter halo and so one thing I will suggest is but just a disclaimer when you contour your eyebrow you should use something darker on the top and lighter on the bottom so that she won't have that halo effect because for myself I know that I'm gonna put on foundation so it really won't make a difference but if you are just trying to walk out the house and not add those extra steps in then I would just say dark on the top lighter on the bottom and that's all you need to do but nonetheless this is what my eyebrows looking like I've done one side and I will continue to do the other so so I'll be using the anastasia beverly hills dipbrow in the shade evany and i'll also be using the age rewind concealer by Mabel in the shade hazelnut for me I'd like to just start off going to the inner part of the brow and so you can get to the tail I really like to lighten it but of course this doesn't have to be perfect because you will be going back in with your concealer and then from there I'll go straight to the top and I like to have a 45 degree angle to my brow I like having a really nice angled brow because we don't like square brows over this way I would like to know is that yeah your brows are not twins they're sisters okay sisters so they don't have to be completely even but one thing that I love to do is just make sure that they kind of link up here like if I want to stare you down like what are you talking about they just have that like nice little even arch and even if it doesn't have it on one side or the other you can always go back and just add some more definition to that thing this is honestly my favorite part I feel like you really need to be patient and honestly it's just the same way as you would do your brow you start from the inner eye and move towards the end with like a swiping motion and making sure that you blend everything out I will say is that you can use any concealer it doesn't really matter I would just make sure that it's not runny for me I really like to use the age age rewind concealer by Maybelline or I'll also use the dubious place concealer but I've realized that this is pretty runny and so you have to be very careful when applying it but for me I like to use things where I can control the amount so this or even the Stila steak foundation but it also has the concealer on the top a mere two if your very price conscious then sticking with maybe a Maybelline age rewind might be the better fit for you but nonetheless let's get back to leave one thing to note is that if your tail is not long enough you can always go back and lengthen it out so you just have to go back into your pot here and just lightly go back over so see how this one kind of stretches to like the end of my eye here this other one kind of meets that at like the end of the eyelid so that being said you can just slightly go from the bottom and drag it out like so like that I really love I forgot her name but she always says like so like that because that's your business okay and that's all day that's one period whoo and now y'all we're going to take our ring fingers so we're just gonna gently Pat it out now of course again as I said like you're just trying to walk off the house well then this is the step that you need to do since I'm not I mean I'm gonna just do it anyway for the sake of this video but again as I said you need to make sure that you use a darker shade on the top so that you don't have this Taylor thing and then a lighter color on the bottom or a more neutral color on the bottom but anyway this is how I usually do my eyebrows Oh this is how I do my eyebrows on a day-to-day basis yeah if you guys have any questions comments concerns or if you have any recommendations for me in terms of how I do my own brows let me know for me I don't usually set soon so I just kind of mean with a rock with it of course my wedding isn't the only way but that's what I like to do and that's just that one back again y'all don't pass it to my halo effect up here as I said I will be using foundation to cover and blend it out so it's not gonna look as she but yeah if you guys enjoyed this video make sure you like comment and
