  good morning I am NOT awake I'm not like but I'm here I'm ready to wake workout I I guess it's like the weariness that we're all feeling that's just making it so hot to wake up in the morning I'm not saying everybody's having a hard time waking up for the morning but I'm saying the weirdness and I'm feeling I'm guessing that's what's making it harder from I'm usually such a morning person I'm up at 5:00 I got to work out it's very energizing and I have slept through my alarm a couple of days this week which is extremely unusual for me I usually set my alarm for 4:45 and kind of lay in bed until about 5:00 or so looking through my phone which is a really bad habit I should probably not do that but that's what I do I think went on for 4045 I snooze until almost 5:00 and I was like okay I'll get up but then I didn't get up I I've stayed in bed into like 550 just looking through my phone I was awake but so tempted to go back to sleep is anybody else having trouble waking up in the morning I mean I got enough I I think I got enough sleep I was asleep by 10:00 so I got almost 7 hours which is usually by like sweet spot I don't know man and I keep thinking to myself I'm gonna go to bed earlier I think I need more sleep and I'm so tired I'm like so tired right around when I'm putting the kids to bed like I go to sleep right now around around 8:00 and then I'll be like okay I'll just spend you know like an hour doing something really low-key like taking a bath yeah I've been taking a lot of athlete I've noticed like almost every day and then I'm like can't go to sleep I think it's because when I like anxious mind turns on and that's when I start looking at the news stories about the you know about the the virus and I'm just like no girl no no oh so let's go give I need to force myself lights out earlier not allow myself to look at my phone I think I need to set phone limits I need to not look at my phone after like 8:30 and not look at my phone until after my workout in the morning I mean except it you know turn off the alarm and make sure nobody's like emergency texted or called me or anything like that but yeah it's going on 5:30 so I need to get on the one here I'm gonna do some core yoga today core power yoga it's a program it's a passionate studio I joined a couple months ago and obviously and always going studios right now but I'll flip you around and show you this is the there is it okay this is their platform their online platform it's got different kinds of classes my favorite is yoga sculpt I have not tried yoga school body weight I like using the weights this is my strength training so I'm going to do a 60 minute class today but I want to do a yoga sculpt class so I'm gonna look through there this is not free you have to pay for this but they might have some free content I will link them below and you can check them out if you want  this did an hour honestly I love the love the studio classes I love them I burn three times as many calories it's also it's a very hot room like intentionally hot and just there's a lot of energy in the room that use popular music and it's a much more intense workout the at home workouts are like a third the intensity they don't use any copyrighted music and obviously I don't have this class energy or this teacher there or the heated room or any of that but I'll take it it's better than nothing yeah so it's 6:30 now I'm gonna get myself ready take a shower and the kiddos should be up pretty pretty soon so here's today I'm gonna I decided I wanted to share a little bit of like one of the days you know like our weekdays just like I remember what this time was mainly but I'm not going to show too much of the kids I've already talked about that but I'll show a little bit and yeah that's what I want to say let's see the David's like that let's just let's get through another day okay anybody else feel like coffees never been so important in your life than it is now anyway that's just out milk in my father with two shots of espresso half-caf and a little Steve yet and we'll listen and I will enjoy and I just got the kids breakfast it was one of those morning's where they told me they wanted one thing and they sat down and were like where's the other thing I was like but you said you wanted one thing anyway one of those days got Daniel tiger on I'm having this yogurt from Trader Joe's and with blueberries and The Fairly Elizabeth granola which is so good Donny will probably eat half of that practice oh are you guys but I'm feeling especially like edgy today don't like I'm hoping my mood turns around I noticed that when I'm not doing like a lot of cardio which produces endorphins I don't get the same like feel-good effect even though I worked out for an hour it was strength training like I did get my heart rate up that hot I didn't burn that many calories and then would you know release a lot of endorphins I think so I'm cranky I don't usually like to film I'm cranky but just kind of trying to keep it real what the quarantine life here so so far this morning looks like any other morning in a quarantine or not I woke up early I got my workout I got a shower they've got the kids dressed and ready for the day we had breakfast or watching cartoons and then in a few minutes we're gonna start he not unusual hundred-day which up is online curriculum and I've said this on Instagram but I appreciate so much so much what our teachers have done for kids I understand that it's very overwhelming for people who have kids even as young as first grade and up but for me with a preschooler Anna toddler it is absolutely a joy the the we have a couple of class check-in meetings like zoo meetings a day where we get to see everybody and I cut their classes are very small so we get to see their classmates and they could see their teachers the morning one is just a quick little check-in because in midday one that's the story times that we have classes for each of them so for classes in the morning and then one afternoon lesson for assisi and it's it's not like you know it's it's a presentation mainly on something interesting like yesterday was learning about the parts of a fish um so it's not you know there's no homework there's no graded curriculum we're not worrying about any of that not what they would be doing anyway and in between the meetings the teachers provide materials for us every day new materials videos songs physical education music even the music teacher post the video every day I've been playing a piano he talks about a different composer and it's a little like background I don't know it's just it's been a real real help but I understand and I can appreciate that for parents of children who are like I said even first grade and going up and it is infinitely more complicated I'm not really feeling like I'm homeschooling I feel like we are just enjoying the curriculum and having fun and it's very relaxed like we do what we can or we want and we try to attend the meetings because that means the most of the kids to see and connect with their peers and their teachers in that way but I I really love the school what they've been doing and I really really appreciate the effort they're putting in even for kids as young as mine to stay connected and provide you know stuff for us to do so in a few minutes we'll start the non usual portion of our morning routine we'll have our salutely I'm not going to film any of the school stuff but just know that we'll be having our little zoo meetings and then we do a little curricula like some of the videos and stuff and then we usually go out for a walk with Winnie and for a little explore in our neighborhood rinse and repeat my memory card just Malthusian let's never in any way what you've seen throw some bananas baby spinach yeah  I'm prepping oh nice I'm prepping the kids trave this goes to our City Mini double stroller for a little walk and a little morning snack and then we'll go have a wander in the neighborhood windy wind today it's like 78 degrees this is not public park by the way this is a private parties as you can see there's nobody here can get down good to have all right a little mid-morning update for you we did our early meetings we did some of the online content from school and then we I setup snack I showed you guys set up snack in the stroller for the kids when it's warmer we take the wagon and they walk more but it's like 40 degrees it's really chilly it was even chillier than I thought it would because it's even though it's sunny it's a windy so I think I could have put them in an additional layer hi there oh you put on a different dress are you doing very nice yeah I'm just having a chat do we want to watch some more videos from school uh-huh okay give me one minute and then I'll set it up okay okay why because I need to set it up all right anyway okay anyway what I just remembered the one thing I wanted to say is I was bringing in the stroller and the trash can the kids are inside taking off their shoes and stuff sounds like a minute gonna come in mass hysteria I'm telling them right now Bloods coming out of doggies mouth I'm like I'm gonna happen in a minute apparently what do you run into see see did he what did he hit his face on the door the door apparently he ran into the door and bit his lip a little bit luckily he didn't like bite through it or anything really severe child the two-year-old boy during the virus times like we cannot go to the ER a couple weeks ago he hit his face well he pushed a big heavy on one of our chair our counter stools he push it and it keep teetered back and smacked him in the nose and I thought he had broken his nose but he's fine he did not break his nose anyway just trying to get through the shelter in place without going to the hospital for toddler related injury what do you I am done he's taking his temperature of his I nearly could be just the parameter now so it's midday it's lunchtime this is the state of the Hat hi this is the state of things at lunchtime I haven't looked the home looks over here oh not too bad in here but yeah there's a lot going on this little toilet this little one right here brings me so much joy I don't want you to open all week I love it so much it broke off of this okay which is going absolutely love how nutty that tulips go after a while they all you know sir that is right even bunny sure they're nutty creep in just just creep in just a little bit you always time thank goodness okay I've noticed an editing when I'm holding the camera oh my gosh you guys I just did yoga and then I watched Glennon Doyle's been putting up on the weekdays she's the author of untamed the book I've been talking about um on weekday morning she puts up like a 10-15 minute Instagram IG TV like check-in and it's been like therapy for me to be honest so I save it to watch after my yoga that's what I've been doing at least the last couple of days and it's just a nice reprieve in the middle of the day I I am on the edge today I just oh my gosh I feel like my nerves are just like raw and exposed and I was like what I just think I've been thinking about this all day I'm like what is going on we're okay we're in good health my family is all okay and in good health we're safe um things are you know for what it is they're going as well as possible I mean I guess but the thing is the news is getting worse and worse like what's happening in the world and especially right now in our country it's terrifying it's horrifying and terrifying and just like so gut-wrenchingly sad and I feel that very intensely I've heard people talk asked me before people have asked me if I'm an empath I don't really understand what that is I haven't looked into it but I know that there's a reason I don't tune into news regularly because it affects me deeply and I have to be very careful about what content I consume because I tend to absorb like feelings for other people so me I don't know if that's what that is I have no idea I have been looking at news a lot more since you know in the past I don't know for two for two plus weeks because of wanting to stay in touch and in tune with what is happening and just up to speed and I have gone through periods of going through a lot of news and then pulling back and going through life and it's just I find that that line is wavering tighter and tighter that I am realizing as we're getting deeper into this that I I need to really really really really manage my news intake but it's hard because I want and I want to be in the know I want to know what people are going through and to know what everybody is facing and what we are dealing with collectively I want to know the individual stories I want to know the pain I want to be a part of this world so hard to strike a balance isn't it I know that it's not good for me though I am NOT being my best parent self either I feel like I've been really snippy today and I hate it when I am snippy I I've apologized to my kids like I've at least three times today and they're saying that I'm so sorry that that's nippy mommy's cranky I'm sorry it's not there you know not anything they're doing mommy needs a nap that's like what we say when somebody's cranky usually it's because one of them if they're cranky it's because they're hungry or tired or both so we go through that list first to find out why we're cranky at two and four those are kind of the things that make you cranky but honestly those are the kind of things that make anybody cranky but there are like that list grows longer I think as you as the kids mature and as you go into an teenager of course in an adult but at two and four those are like the the headliner cranky things right so that's how I explain to them Oh mommy's cranky I need a rest and they see that as oh I need a nap but to me it's I need some self-care up in here I need to sit down and breathe for a few minutes so that's my yoga and I need to listen to words that soothe my soul so that's Glennon I'll link Lenin's Instagram below if you guys want to see that you know follow her and also the yoga with Adriene free free youtube videos and it's like I always think to myself I could be doing so much in this like hour and a half while again I know I could be working on the organizing I could be editing I could be bubble up know what you need to be doing is breathing cuz I know it's tough time anyway I just did those things I came down a few notches on the cranky belt and I feel a little less I just I don't know what the better word is I just feel like emotionally raw like sore anyway I don't like I trying to like figure out how to post and be a beat and it's hard I've been I had been doing lives daily and they've just kind of been petering out this week and I'm realizing it's because I can't I'm having difficulty showing up live on Instagram I mean when I'm not like 75% and I've been like 50 percent 100 percent would be non pandemic like awesome day 75% is like an awesome day in the pandemic 50% is where I'm hovering and it fluctuates wildly throughout the day so I'm sorry I haven't been I really am I'm I'm apologizing because I I am sorry not only because not because I feel like I owe it to people but because I do really want to be on live and I am sorry for myself but you do it I mean I just feel like I wish I could be that 75 and be connecting with you I don't know again balance trying to honor the balance this is really uncomfortable sitting like this but I'm gonna go make a cup of tea and work on the grocery list my parents are letting me do grocery shopping for them the kids are seeing done this evening so I am going to drop them off and then try to go to the store and get some things for them and get some things for us because I'm not going to the store get them because I'm only going once like this is it so as much produce as I can get anything on my parents that I can I think that's another thing that's making me edgy today I I'm really dreading going to the store I'm gonna wear gloves I mean I don't have a mask yet I ordered a couple of masks for myself and for the firm item for me and for the kids but I'm just gonna wrap a scarf around my head because I that's all I got I'm like I got rid of all my bandanas I guess a few years ago cuz I've been looking around my house for them I guess I guess I that's cotton right anyway hang in there guys hang in there Jen hang in there we will hang in there as best as possible I got some teas from Steve Balaji which is a small business that I'm passionate about supporting I don't know when this vlog is going up but I'm giving this away on my Instagram I've been posed I mean even though I'm not doing the lives quite as often I'm trying to I have been posting a lot daily on my stories especially so if you're not following me there I don't know then you want to I'll put the link anyway the order came in on Monday morning and I left the box sit for three days and I opened it it's Thursday morning I opened it yesterday so I think I let it sit longer they said three days I don't know you guys they keep changing I just did what I could I let it sit for as long as possible but then I was like I need my teeth so I opened it up today and now I'm gonna try this one this seems like a really good to you to have today let's take a look at it I'm gonna focus know if you guys can see it very well it's not very bright here it's beautiful and smells divine I always had lots of questions on my teenager mince the Breville one touch you see I have except for purple if you are a passionate tea drinker who drinks a lot of varieties of teas and cares about steeping times and steeping temperatures totally worth it completely frivolous but I use it every day and this is my favorite honey also it's not Amazon in fact I've gotten lots of requests to make Amazon store and I'm working on that if it's up by the time this video is I'll put it in the description this has been my favorite honey for years and years and years it's actually pretty local I think it's from Wisconsin um Michigan yeah pretty local to the Midwest but this with the royal jelly and you can look up royal jelly has a lot of very you know a lot of health benefits but it is creamy and just dissolves beautifully and honey and it's my favorite it's a little cup of comfort here today look at that liquid gold right there alright well this is what I've got for this is our lists combined don't let you decide if you can tell which things are for my parents so much things are for us mainly for us we're pretty good on everything except for fruit and veg um we have lots of frozen veg we have a lots of dried Goods frozen proteins are fine or all that I think what we really need also though is flour we need flowers all right you guys I've got my disposable list so don't have to pull out my phone I've got latex gloves and I'm gonna wrap my scarf around this is so last time I went to the store was holy Kegel I was hoping to stretch it out but um we could have stretched out to Sunday but I wasn't sure but on Sunday I feel like everything's gonna be closed because of Easter so I'm doing this doesn't seem effective this is the best thing I've got I don't have a mask I'm have anything resembling a mask so I guess I just have to do this I'm like already claustrophobic great here we go all right guys typical Chicago 78 degrees two days ago now flurries great mission accomplished I've never been to that grocery store before but it was perfectly fine and I don't know it was like very barely anybody there they had Plexiglas up at the registers my staff did not stay up but there was like nobody around so I felt like that was fine I did did I mention I ordered a mask it's just this just not gonna work so but the gloves felt good to have the gloves on I'm gonna say that eyes anyway now and I'm gonna run to my parents house now and drop drop up with groceries another a very sad moment where I can waited them but I can't actually but but I'm so so happy I could do this and I also stopped at our local favorite bakery which happens to be a gluten-free dairy-free bakery and I bought a couple of special little treats for the kids you guys these cookies how beautiful buy these cookies I'm gonna give a couple to my parents and I thought I'd stick a couple in the mailbox um my um my cousin my cousins my needs a nephew um so yeah they're so pretty they're coming for my kids fluffy bunny anyway gonna wrap this here I'm gonna run a back yep that's exempt my plan at the dishwasher going got a load in the dryer upstairs all the things alright you guys I know if this was remotely interesting but I hope you enjoyed hanging out with me today and I hope you're doing well as well what's up from you Winnie do you I take care of you guys take good good care
