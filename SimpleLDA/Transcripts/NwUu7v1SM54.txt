  hi guys and welcome back to the unit 1 life or the quarantine life uh but you thought that I wasn't gonna come back but I told you I would and Here I am so my plan is to go every day of logging so I think I'm going to have a specific upload time because my ideal plan is once a week or twice a week depending on how it goes or one so we don't want to do like a YouTube livestream and then another day of the week I want to do an Instagram live I wish YouTube had the same thing that Instagram life does where you can invite a guest and like on video because I think that one of the reasons I wanted to come back is because I wanted to connect with you guys and share our quarantine stories and just be there for each other but I feel like you know the videos I upload and you guys comment but that's I still feel like that's not a very personal interaction like it could get more personal so anyway that's my plan but let's just start with the vlogging first I'm really gonna do it everyday I have no excuse because currently I am not working at all I'm not even working from home except one thing we're doing Steven and I are doing a livestream for the Met on Saturday so I'll tell you more about that as we get closer but yeah I have no excuses so I'm here if you guys I feel like I don't even know where to start but I feel like I've been doing a lot of consuming during this quarantine and it's been a month over a month already that's so insane we basically haven't left the house in over a month we go to the Orser store once a week and that's downstairs we don't even have to leave our street I've taken like two walks I think but New York City is so crazy that I don't know I'm honestly paranoid every time we go outside even with the masks and gloves and everything else that we have to do so we're both kind of just waiting it out in here and to be honest with you guys I am NOT going that crazy cabin fever is definitely real but I am introverted and all of you introverts are like Hello whatever has everyone else been like the bomb sitting at home and I've definitely enjoyed it and it's more natural to me I feel like then a lot of the extra motors out there but I do miss you know social things I miss my friends and I just miss being doing things together outside with my friends and family but all in all it's been it's been okay I think that we as human beings are so resilient and we're actually a lot more adaptable than we give ourselves credit for and I think it's being proven right now so for all of you guys out there stay strong do what you're doing and be safe but anyway I'm always going to tangent you guys know that this by now I feel like I've been doing a lot of consuming of things media social media I've been watching too much TV and I thought that I wanted to be creative a little more creative than consuming so I'm here to give you something to consume and hopefully this is going to be a good journey for us it's gonna be a little different vlogging I guess because I'm always gonna be home but I always even that I feel like I've been I've logged more at home normally in the past and I think you guys enjoy that more also I have to still get my lights figured out I ha I'm in front of a window and I might ring light on but I'm not sure like is that better or is that better no I think it's better like this one of the reasons that I feel like I get insecure about vlogging is because you know I think the majority of people are a little more organized in their vlogs and I'm kind of all over the place and that's just how I am so I don't think that I'm gonna be able to change that so I didn't change for the vlog this is literally my quarantine outfit I'm shout out to the Castella Boxing Club this is my husband's family it's Boxing Gym in Philadelphia and I have this in four different colors and I've been basically rotating it every day you'll see that I've been wearing this every day so I love it it's really comfortable on my bottoms I do have pants on I wear pants but I try not to wear sweatpants everyday because one of the things I'm trying not to do is the 14/15 or whatever number I do not want to gain weight and be let's spit by the time I'm out of this I want to be the opposite so I just did yoga and I've been doing yoga with adriene was my favorite and then I've been doing but Heather Robertson 12-week workout and I actually only have one exercise laughs about 12 week and then I'm going to be starting another one not exactly sure where I'm going to do it's gonna be I think a combination of Chloe tang and Alexis run I think but I'll let you know maybe we could do it together but I definitely want to take this time to be more fit and stronger so try not to our sweatpants because it's kind of hard to not over eat when you're wearing such loose clothing so I try to wear workout bottoms as much as I can not only because it keeps me accountable if I'm getting a little you know bigger but it also keeps me more motivated to do a workout on that day I got some dumbbells on Amazon when this first started because all the gyms are closed if you guys want to know what I'm using I can do like a full foot fit this a video we could talk about vitamins supplements blah blah blah all that stuff but uh anyway I went on another connected what I was trying to say is I get into care about the vlogging thing because I feel like I'm really disorganized and also I just can't do the makeup in here every day I really have so much respect admiration for all the girls who are able to do that to film on a daily basis I just cannot not only because I don't want to but especially now I want to give my everything a break I'm really sad about my lash extension so let's start there I've had last extensions for over two years now and onstop and to be frankly honest with you guys I try to put on strip lashes this look right before this that's the only thing I try to do and I was like look this I can't do it it's stupid and ridiculous but I'm really sad because everyday it's like a little flash funeral and this side is just and this is like my bad side and this side of Korus has fallen off faster but I'm just taking this as a signing to just let my lashes grow and bring back health to my lashes and also foundation and makeup why isn't this year I think I haven't won I can public count on my hands how many times I wore makeup like at all I definitely wore it you know if I had like a girls night out or a D&I person like that but on a daily basis I haven't and it's just done so much good for my skin and I just want to keep that going especially during this time I think it's the perfect time to give your skin a break and you'll really notice that your skin will appreciate it it'll be supple more supple look younger and you'll actually start to feel more confident in your own skin I think so yeah I definitely encourage that and my hair okay so blonde is extremely high maintenance and thankfully I haven't got to gotten to that threshold where I am not really sure about to take a different direction because my next color appointment was supposed to be end of May so I still have a month and I've done a water bleaching in the last few months for various variety of reasons and I feel like this is a good to really let my hair come back like heal itself so I've been just doing a lot of hair masks and obviously washing it which is a lot easier now that I'm not doing anything so what you do a hair routine if you guys want all the masks that I like the shampoo conditioners and what I'm doing to try to manage it the only thing oh I don't have it here I have a little scissor or that I get whenever I feel a CD I tried to cut ball my split ends but that's another story for another day what else what else what else what else Oh so back to my original topic and I feel like I just can't be put together for a video and help put together content so I'm just hoping that you guys are ok with that I know you oh geez who have been here is that vocal fry do I have that someone said that once at home what is that and I looked it up but I think it's because I don't talk very much because I I'm not outside maybe my voice is getting lower I don't know what's going on um anyway so I feel like if you guys could put up with that me looking ratchet like a potato every day then we're gonna have some fun here hopefully so I just wanted today to be just an introduction oh another thing now that I said introduction to reminded me I can never really have a good intro like what should my entropy give me some suggestions because I feel like everybody has an intro or an outro and I have none TRO so let me know what you think I think I'm gonna be doing a recipe video um because one of my friends Jen if you're watching hi Jen she said she had bought like a whole thing of kimchi and it's so much and she didn't know what to do with it and I was like there's so many recipes you could make with it so I think I'm gonna do a kimchi recipe and I feel like I'm gonna try to do like a healthier version of stuff because it's what I've been trying to eat because I definitely want my comfort food but if I eat comfort food everyday situation so tomorrow I think I'm gonna make a healthier version of kimchi fried rice so stay tuned for that if it's not tomorrow's a next day you're gonna have to give me a couple of days to just kind of play around with the schedule and upload schedule but I will definitely be here every day 99% every day if I miss a day I apologize but I'm gonna aim for every day so I think that's gonna be one of the first videos because I really want to eat that as well and yeah so let me know down below all I want to connect with you guys again I mean you guys know that this is why I started this YouTube channel anyway in the beginning because I just wanted to connect with everybody in different parts of the world and we've really learned that we are that although we have so many differences we are all the same and this is the epitome of realizing that were the perhaps how similar we are and we're facing the same thing and the same hardships and even though I feel like looking through a social media how vast of a difference people can have during this experience I think emotionally maybe at least emotionally we have similar feelings so anyway I think I'm gonna wrap it up for today thank you so much for coming back and keep coming back to my channel although I haven't been the most consistent queen but I'm kind of like this I think it's going back to my introvert it's off again you know I've got to say there's one character of me that you can count on is that I'm loyal so I won't leave I'm here I think that I need a lot of time for myself sometimes and that is why I take some of these longer breaks especially when I'm busy with other stuff and I'm overwhelmed with personal things or professional things outside of you do but I will always come back and I'm always here for you I try to always connect even through Instagram Instagram stories and direct messages with you guys even when I'm not on YouTube but if you guys are willing to accept me for who I am and how I am when I come back it's like meeting an old friend like it's like nothing changed you know so I hope that you guys could count on that and I know that a lot of you do and that's why you keep watching me and I say thank you and I appreciate it and got it I wouldn't get nervous that when I start a video like oh my goodness it and then at the end net by the end I just can't shut up so here I am doing that again so I'm just gonna shut up now and I was you guys tomorrow list I have an outro with outro
