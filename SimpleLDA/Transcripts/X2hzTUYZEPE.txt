 hey guys pragmatic prepper here just coming in with my next installment of the vlog series this is probably the most sobering and depressing video that I've put out so far things have changed dramatically within the last 24 hours based on the developments that I've seen and I'm hearing about so our number of cases in our area as increased dramatically we only have 15 testing kits available for the entire area so they're not even able to test everyone so the number of actual cases has got to be drastically higher than what they're reporting as of Sunday at 5 p.m. this coming Sunday all non-essential employees in your state have to stay home so that is effectively going to shut down most of your small to medium even large businesses and it's going to be a huge downturn for the economy this is going to affect not only myself but everyone around me that itself is bad enough but that the information that I'm hearing I'm pretty good authority is that the National Guard is possibly going to be sent in to enforce a shelter-in-place policy the shelter-in-place policy is to begin on Sunday at 5 p.m. I don't know about you guys but that's that's not something I'm looking forward to and I I really hate that I that I'm right about this that I've been predicting this for a while I was hoping it would never get to this and they say it's only gonna be a couple weeks I have no idea what that actually means I don't think that that's what it's really gonna be and I have no idea what that actually looks like there's been some reports out of New Rochelle New York or they've basically been under military quarantine for a while now but not a whole lot of information of like actually what's happening on the ground there it's it's weird it's hard to get anything I think it's gonna be bad I think that either the virus is a lot worse than I said it was that's that's some people thinking that's a possibility but I also think it's equally if not more likely that this is a scenario where the government's gonna have just sort of the ability to shut down and take over larger metropolitan areas and do what they will I've heard different reasons for that some people say it's to reset the markets and the dollar and go to a completely digital currency which has so many implications that are just far-reaching it would be akin to having sort of the Chinese social credit system if your honor if you had a completely digital currency everything is run centrally anything that you buy anything that you do is completely direct I don't know if that's what's going to happen I that's some some people talked about that and I'm not sure if I subscribe to that at the very least though the freedoms that we have have are going to be seriously curtailed I think that it's likely that if there is a a sort of complete supervised lockdown that some people will start to get agitated as can be under you know understandable and that they will predictably act out and insist in certain ways and that the government might use that as a reason to institute martial law and I am NOT looking for training of that so any of you out there who who are in one of these areas either my state or California or Illinois where they're issuing shelter-in-place orders please get some supplies now do it now you only have a day and a half to do it please stay inside for you know the time that they say I understand that it's it's very likely that's going to go past that and what you do beyond that point you know is on you I'm certainly not one of those people that it I'm willing to trade my freedom for security in the long term however I also don't want to be that person that instigate civil unrest when this could just be a short-term deal the drug is out into the long term then I understand other choices have to be made I know this is a lot more sobering of a video than what you guys are probably used to I got to say that for the first time in my life and especially the first time in my proper life this is the first time that I felt truly afraid for more than a passing moment this is existentially terrifying to be honest with you because there's so much unknown we don't know what's gonna happen there's a lot of rumors there's a lot of just misinformation there's a lot of information and all of that mixed together it makes makes things very uncertain and that's going to just very much contribute to the entire sort of social anxiety and personalized idea that people are going to feel and I'm not really um I'm not looking forward to how this is going I just got done watching Canadian Preppers video as I was about to make this and I couldn't agree more with him about what he said get your props get stuff together if you can if you can't I'm sorry you know you guys had time I I don't take any any joy in this whatsoever I wish I could rewind the clock to months and go back and reset things and we could just carry on as usual I have to make the decision as to whether I want to bug out or bug in I'm not even sure if bugging out it's a possibility you know right now based on what whatever the capabilities are of whoever gets sent here the National Guard or did you know army or whatever some sectors of the military police forces I have no idea so I'm I'm gonna have to make some decisions over the next day or so I hope that you guys all keep it together as best you can and I realize that we you know we're all in we're all in this together in some way or another and I want to give a shout out to my favorite channels Canadian prepper your number one out there for me praxis proper your close number two prepared mind city prepping Survival Lily thanks guys for a lot of that content I picked up from you a lot of things that I've learned it's been a great exchange of ideas and what I'm gonna try to make a video tomorrow and hopefully things don't go where they could go hopefully this isn't the worst case scenario that I'm imagining and and and we can keep in communication I could keep making videos but if I don't make any videos it's either I'm in a location where I can't or this service is no longer available so you guys all take care be good to each other and yourselves and pragmatic prep route
