I think I have a one quad SRP for my patient and they are here cool so jaemor and I are John new ambassadors and we're currently takin some pics doing a photo shoot lighting light hello everyone and welcome to another vlog  I just woke up and it's currently 9:39 a.m. on Tuesday March 24th so I'll catch you guys up to speed on what's been going on and also live in Seattle where the co bid 19 outbreak is pretty bad so I just wanted to blog how that's been going as well just wanted to show you a day in the life of my self quarantine woke up to a blemish nice I don't know why because I haven't been wearing makeup the past week there's not much on the agenda today I'll try to blog the best I can because I have nothing better to do not supposed to touch my eyes not supposed to touch my eyes okay I'll just go through my day as I normally do and usually I go on my phone and check social media just so bad but that's what I'm gonna do now  okay so I'm scrolling on Instagram and one of the meme pages that I follow post this people with birthdays in March suspect and that's me because my birthday is on March 29th it's on Sunday and I can't celebrate my birthday with my friends okay time to shower and get this day started I'm done showering and I'm about to make my breakfast it's gonna be a protein smoothie a scoop of chocolate protein soy milk peanut butter and a banana and these are very very ripe bananas  hmm yeah okay still running my hair air-dry finish my smoothie I am probably not gonna put on makeup today because I will be at home all day so letting my skin breathe this is my outfit of the day sweatshirt and so what pants whoo my laundry just finished drying so now I'm gonna fold that it is now lunch time so I'm just gonna make a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup trying to use most of the ingredients are leftover in my fridge cuz I'll be staying at my parents house for the next week or so I got my Dave's killer bread tomato basil soup from Costco that is heating up right now and I'm just gonna use whatever cheese I have left so I've got some mozzarella and then the Mexican cheese blend from Costco all right lunch is ready tomato soup a pickle and the grilled cheese Wow all right so to give you an update about everything that's going on here in Seattle our governor just instilled a shelter in place yesterday evening I believe to stay at home order you're only allowed to go out for I think it's groceries doctor appointments and essential job functions but everything else is closed down and it's been like this for I would say over the past week where we've been advised to stay home but people were taking it seriously which is why he put this gel shirt in order this order is pretty essential to Washington because even when I was driving around or if I was running around last week I saw kids like lots and lots of kids at the parks in my parents neighborhood or when I was driving around and people weren't practicing social distancing and the whole point of this order is that people take seriously people actually are mandated to stay home now for the next two weeks so that's what I've been doing so I have self quarantined myself since one and a half weeks ago I believe during the last week of school which was finals week that was the week from March 8th through the 13th that whole week was a mess for us because a swen Cova 19 outbreak started to really pick up in seattle and we weren't prepared there was lots of uncertainty especially for students we weren't required to go to school if we didn't feel like it was safe for us or if we ourselves were immunocompromised if we started experiencing signs of symptoms then we were asked to stay home the first few days of that finals week I think I only saw one patient and then starting Wednesday I started to feel sick so then I stayed home and then after that we had scheduled 2 weeks of spring break and so last week we had a full week of spring break I had originally planned with my family to go to Las Vegas for a family vacation to meet up with my cousins and that had to be cancelled because we wanted to self quarantine and not contribute to the pandemic I went to my parents house they live around 25 minutes away from my apartment and I've just been chilling at home uh what else did I do this is the second week of spring break now I've continued self-quarantine usually I just wake up eat exercise I did not today because today is my rest day what else have I been doing lots of Hulu YouTube and Netflix but as far as going back to school goes and how our dental school is handling the Cova 19 pandemic our governor issued a statement last week that ordered all dental offices to only do emergency procedures through May 18th May 18 which is a month and a half away I know that the ABA and the national government have also stated their orders and recommendations but specifically for Washington dental offices we are not allowed to do elective procedures and told me 18 for me as a dental student that means I can't do any cleanings fillings crown preps basically anything that produces aerosols and anything elective means anything that is non-emergency we are going to be doing online lectures and this goes for undergrad and graduate students but we have clinic we're still trying to figure that out since we're not allowed to do elective procedures so it'd be like why why did we go to school and show up for clinic if we can't if we don't have patience to work on things aren't literally changing every single day I think that I get new emails from our school literally every single day about what's changing also my rotation this quarter is gonna be Pido and ortho Peto is feeded optics or kids dentistry and orthos orthodontics which is braces ortho is mostly elective procedures if there were merging season I believe the residents and faculty would be seeing those same as with peds for third-year clerkship students we only do pro fees during the rotation and cleanings are not allowed right now through May 18th and so I don't know what they're gonna have us juliette because we're still waiting to hear back and then for the kids emergencies those would be likely seen by residents and faculty as well so I'm not sure what our role as third-year students would be yet we're just waiting to hear from our directors and then go from there but it's pretty all up in the air right now that is update on how dental school is going but for the rest of this week I'm just going to enjoy my time off and enjoy trying to enjoy myself quarantine Spring Break very interested to know how your guys's schools are handling the pandemic because the University of Washington was actually the first University in the nation to close down I believe so our school has taken very progressive measures which I am thankful for because they're trying to keep us safe and the outbreak here in Washington is really bad so I'm appreciative of that but I'm just concerned with how it's affecting our education I've done all students especially when we need the clinical experience leave some comments below so I can know how you guys are dealing with this as well that is it for my update just wanted to let you know how schools gone and what I'm up to so it was supposed to rain today but it actually turned out to be powdi and that's it

letter beads and this set I actually had leftover found in my parents house from when I was younger and I just had extra beads and I was like oh very convenient so I have these extra ones as well I

candle from Bath and Body Works midnight blue citrus and I love this scent it's so good  mile this count of working on my hand skills what if I'm making bead bracelets no so I'm gonna keep working on
