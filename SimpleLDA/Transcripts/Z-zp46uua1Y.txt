 morning everyone i have been trying to make my oh my god someone's working out i'm scared he sees me ah a lot just happened in this like one second a lot a lot a lot just happened um wow evan talked to you in a little bit over a week i had finals all of last week so there was no real reason for me to start filming anything because i was dying and i was so stressed but school is now over i'm dead my spring semester what a semester it was also i hurt my foot really really badly and right now i um i just like bent it to like sit you know it's like pop a squat you know how your feet bend and it's like sharp shooting pain again um my friends think it's like slightly fractured um that's what happens when you work out a lot and i don't typically work out a lot and i've been working out almost every day and um it's been hurting for like two weeks or so so i can't really walk and i haven't worked out for the past couple of days also i'm holding this cup of coffee like my life depends on it i've been trying to make my hair like look normal because i want to film a video i started off by having it up and then i like kept looking like an egg and i was just so confused because with this dress i want to have my hair up um but honestly i feel like on camera if like your hair frames your face better so i'll just leave it down i guess but i really don't want to like curl it or straighten it so i'm just gonna let it be natural i really don't think anyone cares my hair and my face shape just don't they don't cooperate um yeah anyway i am sweating and my foot hurts and if you are new here i don't typically start the camera and just start whining but you know when you have like a sharp shooting pain and it feels like someone's chopping up your foot it is now six o'clock i haven't talked to you in so long filming today took so so so long the haul itself was didn't take that long but the try on took like a year because my battery kept dying i kept getting distracted with like my phone and then um yeah long story short it is now six o'clock so basically i was filming for six hours and doing youtube stuff for six hours which i don't mind doing but i'm just kind of like surprised um i'm very hungry all i had was avocado toast i don't have a lot of ingredients to make anything so i'm gonna have breakfast for dinner don't judge me so this is what i'm gonna have for dinner some pasture raised eggs i'm gonna have two and then i'm gonna have two of these sweet apple chicken sausages i have my butter melting right now i'm just literally starving here is my dinner the sausages look burnt but um it's because they are i have my breakfast dinner plate and i'm gonna watch some riverdale because there is a new season i'm watching the last episode of the third season and i'm gonna start the fourth season so that's the plan for the rest of the night it is now at 7 10. so it's just a great time to be alive okay i ate my dinner and now i'm on my dessert and i spilt it everywhere it's kind of gross but i spilled my tea on my brownie don't worry i'm still gonna eat it i made these healthy brownies yesterday and they're so good i'll make them in a vlog in the future so i can show you guys how to make it um it's literally so easy so yeah that's that and i'm gonna drink my tea this is literally the mood right now the same oatmeal i make almost every day decided to explode on me because i put it in there for a little too long  don't fall on me good morning happy sunday i'm sitting on the staircase i just wanted to update you so i didn't film yesterday because i felt so awful i just like i don't know how some people feel so great every day i really really don't i definitely have moods i've just had so much just stress and anxiety over everything and my future and my career and you know i'm not special i feel like a lot of people feel the same way at first i was like ugh like who cares like i don't want to come on here and say this stuff but then like i think when when everyone is being happy and everyone is showing how productive they are and everyone is you know sharing all the good parts um it can seem like that's how everyone else feels and then when you are in a state of feeling like then you compare that i think subconsciously even though like i think everyone knows that they're sharing parts where they are happy and they're sharing what they want to share um i just i felt like it would be misleading if i didn't talk about you know my lows um and i have so many loves like like honestly i cry all the time as much as i'm happy to be in new york city a lot of people ask me why i stayed in new york um a main reason was my visa so i'm on a student visa and canadian there was a ban on travel and at the time i didn't feel safe to hop on an airplane when it was the peak of the virus and my mom has asthma too so could have easily gotten the virus and then gone home and given it to my mom and my sister um it just didn't feel good to get on an airplane at the time and on top of my visa dilemma of like i don't even know what would happen like would i be able to re-enter the country um it would either have to be i moved home i didn't think that i don't think anyone thought that cobid would last this long um at first they said you know it's a lockdown for two weeks i'm like no problem two weeks whatever it's like a little vacation um boy was i wrong as much as i love figuring out my career um like what i want to do how i want to make an impact i think there's a lot that i do know that i want in my life and my career and there's so much that i don't know and i think right now with everything being so uncertain it adds so much extra stress and pressure on what moves i need to be making and what i should be doing um and just not knowing whether or not fit if you guys don't know that's the school that i go to the fashion institute of technology it is a state school in new york city meaning that they don't make the decisions because they're not privately owned they have to do what the state of new york says i just don't think that the situation is going to change that much come fall um i have a very strong feeling that fit is either gonna do half in person half online classes um and one of the main reasons i chose to go to fit and pay international student fees was just the experience of being in new york meeting industry experts just taking in everything that the school offers because it is such a good school and it gives me an opportunity to meet people and do things that i wouldn't be able to back home in canada um just there's a lot of risk that went into this and there's so much reward that could come from it that doing school online in new york city is not what i signed up for that is not what i want to do next term my lease is up in august so obviously i'm going to make a decision by then and i think i'm going to defer for a semester i think that that's the smartest thing to do just because you know if new york fashion week isn't happening that's volunteer opportunities that i can't do like a lot that happens in the fall is basically like stripped away and for good reason like when there's a virus i'm not saying like this stuff should happen a huge bummer for me about the summer was i had an internship lined up and i was so excited it was a dream internship and obviously got cancelled so just not being able to do all these things that i want to do and i want to accomplish and grow i think a lot of these opportunities are going to take a long time to resurface and i think january will be a better month and you know if they're saying there's going to be a vaccine in 12 to 18 months i don't see things being good in september i really don't all these other schools are gonna start earlier and end earlier so long story short i just don't think it's smart for me to pay so much money to live in an apartment when new york is shut down networking opportunities the guest speakers just the overall experience is not going to be the same and honestly new york is sad right now like i get sad seeing everyone in masks the energy of new york is not the same at all um i like the minute i get off an airplane and come to new york i came to new york five times before i moved here um and i have always felt so good landing here it's one of the main reasons this is like my dream city to live outside it's just there's like a sadness in the air there's so much stress like you can feel it and people are not happy and i'm not happy and just seeing people on masks it's a sad thing like it is just so sad that we're living in a time where this is like this is what's happening and let me know what you think too like if you were in this situation or what you're choosing to do for next term my priority is um becoming the best in the industry that i choose to pursue not like the best of like oh my god i need to be the best in the world being the best version of myself and doing the best that i can um and just succeeding in my own way and learning as much as possible i have been telling myself to wait until you hear the news of what the schools are gonna do and i believe that's gonna be in july so i have time i have time to figure things out it's just you know when you get in that headspace of what am i doing and like what's gonna happen and i think as someone who's so future oriented i i definitely panicked if i was american and i could just stay here and do whatever i want that would definitely influence my decision i might stay here um if money wasn't a factor i might stay here there's all these things that go into it that i'm kind of like is this the best use of my time and my money and um am i getting the best out of this experience like yeah sure staying in new york right now um or not now staying in new york in the fall will definitely be an experience but when the possibility of not being able to do certain things within the fashion industry and network and connect with people um kind of depends on my visa and my student status that is a huge factor in this decision um so anyway i am going to wait i'm gonna just see what happens um and what they say and at the end of the day you know the news says something and then let's say come november all of a sudden they they might do the same thing like lights out everyone has to quarantine again and things are going to be the same like no one knows what's going to happen but i just i kind of want to i don't want to leave because things are hard but i also want to make sure that i get the best experience and i do believe if there's a will there's a way like i'm sure i can do a virtual internship but you guys that is not the same thing like i don't want to do a virtual internship i'd rather just come back in the spring therefore extending my visa therefore being able to do internships hopefully um and just get the best out of new york and the fashion industry and just be able to like do things where i don't but right now that's not the case stuff like this doesn't take a few months to heal it takes a while to heal and um it'll be a while until offices reopen and things go back to a new normal that's just where i'm at and i wanted to update those of you who are interested in hearing about that um but right now i am gonna go to the grocery store because i don't have any food let's go let's go to trader joe's and have the best day ever because we are feeling better today and let's make the most of that energy and i'm sweating profusely and let's go grocery shopping this is the outfit i showed my sister this outfit and she was like you look like a ghost she's like what is that ghost outfit i just got in through the door and my foot um i may have mentioned i can't remember i may have mentioned that i think my foot is somehow fractured and i didn't work out for about a week and it's gotten a lot better except that today i was in the trader joe's line for about 25 minutes it started throbbing and hurting so bad again and now it's like it's back to being so painful um it's just like annoying because i was so stoked about like doing the class and working out um almost every day and then i took a week-long break and obviously that's had a huge effect on my mental health and my physical exercise throughout the day and just like walking like a 10-minute walk is so painful i'm literally limping like an idiot so i came right now i just came back from trader joe's like holding two bags like wobbling like a full-on penguin um and i'm just so over my foot hurting it just feels like someone's stabbing it every time i walk sharp shooting pains for sure okay now i'm gonna show you guys what i got from trader joe's the most exciting part of my day i also got a package from amazon i think i know what this is um it was supposed to come tomorrow so i'm very happy that it's here today so let's open it exactly what i thought it was this is what i needed to make my recipes for this video that i'm so stoked to make um i got some bee pollen how exciting this stuff is really good for you i've never had it before um there's a lot of benefits to bee pollen i also got some monk fruit um sweetener this is basically a replacement of sugar got that and then i also got mct oil this step is so expensive i better better see some good results it's a keto vegan paleo supplement that you can put in smoothies and whatnot so yeah i'm i'm hoping this video goes over well and that you guys like it and get something out of it because i'm testing a lot of new things such as these three um so i got these and then yesterday i also got these in the mail i got the classic miss myers clean day um cleaning supplies so it came in a set i got dish soap i'm almost out of that i got a multi-surface cleaner and i got some soap the main reason i placed the order was because i was out of soap so we got that also how do we feel about my diy i put my curtain that i wasn't using on this table and it's it's a lot cuter to look at now and it's a little less ratchet okay let's start with bag number one i got these three it's grass i don't know what these are called but i got them for my face vase because that baby's baby's breath flower is literally dead and it's not cute and this is gonna fit a lot better in my face i had two lips a week ago tulips die on me every single time so i'm never buying tulips again that might be a lie but for this time i'm just gonna let this dry up and be cute in the vase also it's long enough so um i think that's one of the reasons i killed those tulips because i had to fill it up really really high and they just weren't breathing well properly so anyway we got the classic my favorite protein of choice is salmon i got some pita bite crackers i don't want myself eye crackers but i let myself buy crackers this time i've never tried these hopefully they are good we got some spinach got some organic bananas cilantro this is for my tuna salad um got some almond flour and i got some smoked salmon i think i could eat these two together um and some cheese is coming up your way real soon i got some matcha powder this is gonna go in to one of the recipes that i'm gonna film and then i have some organic maple syrup a replenishment of my avocados these are the four regular size avocados they were all sold out of the teeny tiny avocados that i like to get got these two cans of the albacore tuna this is what i use to make the tuna salad okay peace these are just these are so addictive again another snack that i let myself buy this is like candy um they're better for you than candy but there's still a lot of sugar in this this isn't necessarily healthy but in my defense it's healthier than like swedish fish and that's what i want to be eating um but these are so so so good i went through two bags already last week i'm just like you're allowed just let yourself get get your snack um we got a sweet potato some manuka honey cashew butter these two i got for the food video that i want to film and then a reason that i had to go was apple cider vinegar i was out it definitely helps me regulate my mood and i feel cleansed when i drink it in the morning moving on to the second bag i was also out of bread i've been buying the dave's killer bread recently but um i just wanted to pick up some multi-grain sourdough i love this bread it's so so so good got one roll of teepee because i want to be careful i have six right now so got a seventh one we got one lemon i already have like six lemons right now but i always have to get a backup lemon just in case got a ripened avocado um this is for an avocado pudding that i'm gonna make this is also a snack you guys i had to get my favorite snack we got some brie brie is my favorite thing in the whole world got some greek yogurt i love the zero percent non-fat plain yogurt it is my favorite i've always liked like tart no flavor added yogurt because then i love to add a whole lot of honey to it and it's so delicious i've never liked flavored yogurt like i always found it to be so gross like those those yogurts that had all the stuff at the bottom i was like no we got some grape tomatoes this is just an essential for salads and everything else my favorite fruit my favorite fruit this is the best this stops me from snacking and eating chips and other things um and berries are so good for you i love berries more than anything i got some grapes i haven't gotten grapes for a while i love them again another healthy snack so i got got the green grapes i was out of oatmeal again another reason i had to go my main food staples are avocado and oatmeal i cannot live without them and then i got this organic boneless and skinless chicken breast i've never seen this before but um it's basically good for the freezer so we love that coconut milk i actually hate the taste of coconut milk and coconut creamers um but i got this for a recipe and i wanted to get another like beverage so this might not be bad it was the last one so i feel like it's a popular thing and i'm gonna give it a try the last thing is just this little lemon room spray i was out of it so got another one is my full on trader joe's haul which we haven't done for a little bit on this channel so there we go it looks like he has um just like weird hair so much cuter in my opinion like i just love the color combo with the vase being like this a crew cream color and then oop we lost we lost one this is called like bunny tail or something i'm gonna like play around with this so it it looks better um but just like if i'm watching tv we have a friend um and then i'll move it to my room whenever i'm filming something but yeah what do you guys think about this we match this is basically my friend during quarantine because i'm all alone so we gotta make sure our friends are cute so i'll link it down below even though it is unavailable um just so you guys can keep an eye out if you do want it because i've gotten multiple questions about it um but yeah it was from amazon it was like 35 and yeah so cute i think it looks more expensive than it was and i'm a big fan it's very salvador dali esque um and we love that it is now 705 i was gonna make granola today but i feel like it's too late to make granola now um even though time really isn't a thing and it's still light out so technically i could make it but i don't really feel like it you guys my foot hurts um that's the main reason i'm just like losing losing all my energy now i'm just like sitting here doing nothing um after i wipe down and put away my groceries i have just sat in the same spot and checked my email and i've done really nothing i want to go out and cheer too i always feel so left out but no one does it on this side i'll do it from inside you guys whoa i feel so lame of course i want to show my support for the healthcare workers but no one like does it here and i feel awkward going on my balcony and like screaming just can't get the courage to go out there and scream by myself here is my dinner i'm doing a kale oh i'm doing a kale salad with just um baby tomatoes or grape tomatoes with basically a whole lot of shredded almonds i have like half a pack of shredded almonds on there and then the chicken breast and then i'm having my favorite lacroix the razz cranberry lacroix and i'm gonna put olive oil salt and a whole lot of pepper on here and this is tonight's dinner we got the dinner and we are watching some riverdale right now tell me i'm pretty please um i finished my dinner i have on this clearance sos hydra face mask um they gifted me this oh i started using it last week during my finals to relax um they had an option of four different ones i asked for the sos hydra scrub and face mask because the my favorite moisturizer one of my favorite moisturizers ever is by clarence it's the hydra essential moisturizer so i was like of course i would want to try this mask and the face scrub this is a refreshing hydration mask with leaf of life extract what does that even mean um and i like that i can like move my face you know like i don't feel like i have botox when like you can't you put on a mask and you can't move your face and it's actually uncomfortable i ended up editing editing editing my video so now i'm gonna watch some tv and drink my tea and just wind down and relax and set myself up for a great monday tomorrow so that's it for this vlog i feel like it was a long one i hope that you guys liked it thank you so much for spending your time with me um i hope that whoever is watching this is doing good and take care of yourselves please and i will see you guys all in my next video bye everyone
