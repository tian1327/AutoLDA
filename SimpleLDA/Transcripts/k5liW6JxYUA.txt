 max would you like to start off the vlog for us dean said what about me what about me you have anything to say we're quiet this morning since when I guess they're just gonna leave it to me then good morning everybody happy Wednesday well welcome back to another vlog it's early things like 7:30 I obviously just got out of the shower and got ready I was supposed to go nanny today would you stop breathing heavily can you hear him he doesn't like her the way max says Max's it's really loud his is just like heavy breathing it was a saying oh yeah I was what's good nanny today and I got a text just now at the last minute saying I don't have to come which is great I have a lot to get done today so hopefully we can have a very productive day today I was vlogging yesterday but something happened like halfway through the day that was just like really upsetting so I didn't want to it's not even like it wasn't even like a conscious decision that I'm gonna stop vlogging I just didn't vlog the rest of the day so the footage that I do have ended up being like five minutes long and I wasn't that happy with it anyway so I'm not gonna post it so we're gonna just start fresh today with a new vlog but now that I don't have nanny that's four hours back in my day so we're gonna make it to do list and we have lots to do what are you doing over there I think we might start by going to Starbucks after the night I had I really want something to cheer me up and I feel like my eyes are swollen it's fine everything's fine as I've been doing it all of my vlogs I'm gonna have links down below in the description of things that you can do to help black lives matter right now with all of the protests and everything just keep doing your part I know you guys art because you're awesome but just thought I would share any resources that I found in case it would be helpful to anyone sorry if you can hear my cats they're going nuts as usual I don't know why I like first thing in the mornings when they have the most energy and also like right before I go to bed no but would be great if we could film one of my Oh charming things one of my bonus videos for patreon today for my publishing series because I haven't filmed it either of them for this month I do two months that would just be one less thing for me to worry about you know let's start and go get some coffee I'm hoping maybe because it's only and 30 it won't be so busy because I usually go there at 8:30 before work so hopefully the drive-thru line is it too long so I can just likes taking my car this one's actually opened up like completely they had it for a while where if you mobile order you could go to the front door and they have like a counter setup and you could like get it just from the front door but you couldn't go inside but now they've straight up just like opened it up and they have like arrows on the floor and you can't stay and sit in there but you can like go in and order or pick up your stuff I have finished my bagel now I'm ready to work cuz eight o'clock let us start this morning with 20 minutes and I have two cats here for moral support hello I just realized I have enough to do this block in a little while and I also couldn't help from the obnoxious makeup I just filmed the video it is now 11 15 ish I was listening to my audio book while I was getting ready so I'm actually almost done with that one I belissa need to be not far from me I think I'm like two-thirds of the way through it so I have less than 2 hours left I think I'm listening to it like one and a half times speed so we'll finish this one today so now the video I found was from my main channel I was thinking I wanted to film my patreon video today but honestly I feel like I need to do some more prep beforehand I like it my notes together and like figure out exactly what I'm gonna say and stuff funnily enough those videos take like way more preparation the way I main channel videos ooh so it's already almost noon and I have so many other things to do today I think we're gonna put that off to another day so we're gonna jump back over to editorial work for a little while I think I'm just gonna do like a 15-minute time this today today Wednesday part of the problem is I can't decide on what I want my topics to be for this month last month we talked about net galley getting early reviews for your books and then also the differences in book royalties and how much you make from each book from each platform the different factors that go into that you know I'm sorry I really dropped the ball today I keep forgetting that I'm vlogging oh wow I like took off my eye makeup because it was a lot but I didn't take off the rest of my makeup and now I look like ill anyway I actually ended up completely editing that video that I just filmed and I'm just gonna post it today this is what I do when I have extra time I get like really into the zone with a video and I just want to like film it I didn't get everything done in one day and so now it's almost 2 o'clock and I feel working on this all morning so I wanted to make some cinnamon rolls so where's can post this video really quick it's just by June TBR my reading plans for this month which basically consists of thriller novels and books by black authors so that's my main channel if you're interested I guess I'll link it down below now we're gonna make some cinnamon rolls and I'm gonna put in my headphones to hopefully finish my audiobook because I really need to like clean my kitchen and do my laundry and then once we're done with all of that and once we consumed one of these I will get back to editorialize currently Seminoles are becoming our trend because they made these in a different rating blog that I did as well honestly I really need to go grocery shopping you don't have a future so we're getting down to whatever I have left I think I always open these the wrong way they're so hard to open oh yeah I've been listening to that audiobook I think I have less than an hour of it left and now I'm getting nervous on like how she's gonna end this it's gonna explode yes it is oh my god it even got my camera I follow the directions and then this happened it's everywhere look at that we are officially done with work for the day it's 4:45 look at me not working late for once hi Dino you come to say hi I'm making dinner we're gonna have some super greens pasta this is not my usual kind you could tell they were out but this one has spinach zucchini broccoli parsley and kale I'm also doing laundry and we're watching Sex in the City but I'm actually about to go find my headphones so I can finish listening to my audiobook I can finish it like 20 minutes and then we'll probably sit down and start editing this vlog because I haven't even imported any of the footage yet today I feel like we don't have that much footage for today because I keep forgetting to film to make it up to you I will show you the cats you ready Saladin he's down here max oh yeah she's still over here why is this a good spot you don't wanna lay on the bed or the couch just on the floor right here Oh he always does this when I'm petting max he like comes over and poses to try and get attention he gets jealous yeah you're cute too I know you don't have to prove it Maxine my phone because I didn't want to get up and disturb max because look how cute the cinnamon rolls are done they're up there you can't see them I'm now back to editing and Max is sitting here with me I was like Dean got up to ID know that like really close to my face and I've been replying in the comments on the new main channel video that's three o'clock so we'll be sitting here probably till I finish this it's 5:45 every time max hears me talking she comes out hurts me knowing you know I'm gonna go get set up in my office because if you don't know I guess it'll be too late by the time that you see this obviously but Jesse from bowties and books is doing a live on their Instagram 6 at 6 o'clock for me that's like a virtual vigil it's just gonna be 10 minutes long they're gonna turn off comments and so it's just gonna be people sitting in silence and just for mourning and paying respects and stuff so I'm gonna get a candle to light I'm just sitting here for a little while both cats have decided to join me apparently got max down there and deeds up there so that's what we're gonna be doing for the next little bit also while we're just sitting here and waiting I finished the book I liked it I thought it was really well done for what it was it's definitely not my new favorite of her as that it was still really good and I still recommend reading it was reading be not far from me like forgot the hotel if you really like survival stories I think you'll really like this yes like for what it was I thought it was like a really solid survival story the female of the species is just a book that like hit me really hard and I connected with a lot so I really liked that one this one it was really short which is why I say like for what it was it which is like a snapshot survival story it was good it just doesn't I didn't have as much of an impact on me as her other books have had in the past so I think it's a really solid book is just not a new favorite for me would recommend reading though if you know that you like her books or if you like survival stories I love how she just lays here with her little paws curled to her chest like how sweet is this are you comfy yeah yeah obviously I'm not gonna blog well I'm sitting here I'm gonna stay on there for the full 10 minutes so I might have to eat later I might not depending on if I get like really emotional and sad okay it's like 7:30 I'm tired I have a headache we're going into my room haven't read any of this today so we're just gonna curl up and bad and do some reading are you coming are you coming no I feel like this vlog has no interesting content on it so I'm gonna end it here and I think I might take a couple of days off from the vlogs just a kinda like take a break recoup recharge and stuff maybe we'll do like a weekend one or something I feel like the only thing that happened in this vlog was I showed you a lot of clips of the cats but anyway thanks for hanging out with me thank you for watching I don't have anything to plug right now the usual stuff is linked in the description and I'll see you guys in another video later bye
