 hey guys this is very exciting I guess the previous clips were from a few days ago but now is today now studeo am i okay I haven't vlogged in a few days I think I lost it today is Tuesday May 26th so basically my family and I meaning my mom my dad and I we live on Long Island if you don't know probably an hour ah 50 minutes with no traffic drive to New York City so I'm looking to move there if you are new to my channel you can go watch so my recent videos for the updates but basically I was looking to move there maybe late summer maybe whatever kind of whatever the perfect place comes up the problem is obviously there's a global pandemic going on right now so you know moving right now it's not optimal but at the same time kind of gotta do what's best for me it's a really fine line so we're trying to figure it out I don't want to seem insensitive or like I don't like tone-deaf to like what's going on hobbies they recognize what's going on so basically a few days ago my family and I were like looking at some listings I've been using this website called Street easy been really great to use I was just looking and I found some that I really liked so what I had a message the Realtors I was under the impression that most of these places are only doing virtual tours which most of them only are doing virtual tours have reached out to a bunch which then they you know sent me a video and they're like we could FaceTime and like I could walk you through the unit and I was like I'm good you know I'll just go and check out the address and like check out the area and then one realtor did reply and said that I could tour two units that he is available in two different buildings so we are gonna look at some units today this is gonna be very exciting very different I am looking in the East Village area I will just say that if you like that's as specific as I really need to get it people are gonna say probably like why did you choose that area I have just heard from a lot of people who live in New York City that that's really where it's at you know there's a lot of bars and restaurants and things like that I don't really want to have to travel too far like my thing is if I lift up town in like Upper East Sider Upper West Side I would just have to be coming downtown a lot probably to socialize or to do things I just really like like more downtown scene anyways and when I moved to Boston I didn't really take location into account and I looked outside of the city and I wasn't really walkable too much and I just I kind of wanted to not do that with this move I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of questions but I wanted to bring you guys along with us today we are obviously going to be wearing our masks I don't even know if my parents are gonna be able to go on the tour with me we didn't really determine that yet but we just want to kind of get an idea of what I can get for my budget people are probably gonna ask my budget I'm not gonna say the price I guess but I will say it's basically the same as what I'm paying for my unit in Boston Cambridge right now I'm not really changing it up just because I know that it works and it's like a safe amount for me still it's definitely expensive I mean it's expensive I'm living in Manhattan New York City alone even though it's going to be a smaller unit it's just it's expensive it's the most expensive city I believe in the United States I think but I'm really looking forward to it I'm so excited and this is like the most thrilling thing I've done all quarantine so as far as I know it's going to be pretty contactless obviously I don't think it's wise to be going and doing this right now but obviously it's allowed because he wouldn't have offered if it wasn't allowed you know what I mean hope you guys enjoy we're gonna see two units today and I figured I would get to show you guys come along with us I got dressed up for the first time in a like a few days two more in this body suit than three people I straightened my hair put in my or eight hoops let's get it boys  okay so we just parked parking don't know how um but we're gonna go look at these buildings I'm gonna switch to my phone because I just I'm gonna do that the first one we're looking at is going to be I think it's a little less expensive and it's smaller perhaps I don't know we're just gonna go take a look at them honestly we wanted to only see the first one and then the realtor was like oh I have both of these listings and they're only a block away if you want to check them out so here we go hey guys so I'm just realizing I don't think I made it clear that the actual realtor didn't come he just gave us the pin code to the building so we let ourselves in and up and that's why my family and I are not wearing masks when we're in the unit because it was just us he's just my mom my dad and me so just keep that in mind because I realized that it probably looks weird but there is no realtor and that's why I was able to like filming stuff             all right this is her the counters are really nice and I love the sink it does have washer/dryer we've built it together oh is that the dishwasher these doors I almost think you could put like a desk there like very narrow and like push it in there because where else would a Dusko to the size yeah the closet is quite spacious which is nice and I love that I know you don't like hanging out on fire escapes or whatever but people do that yeah Wow we've just been doing some driving around you guys um in kind of like the area I guess we got some takeout from cats I don't even know how to say it Katz's cats cats Oh oh my god these fries is my favorite kind of fried a nice thick potato we fry and I got I got a grilled cheese they got some sandwiches these are the MVPs of the day we've been hunting around so I guess I'm just the worst update so basically we went to the city we're supposed to see two units I called the realtor I was like hey we're here and he actually was like I'm just not even gonna come I'm just gonna like buzz you guys in there was actually another girl looking at the unit too but my family and I like went in and then she went in after us so I got to get some content of it oh and then the other unit that I really was excited about it's about the same size kind of similar finishes and like features and stuff like that except that it did have a big exposed brick wall which I just for some reason I'm really into that some of you guys are telling me that it's like bad for temperature regulation and stuff like that like it gets really cold and really hot so I don't know maybe it's for the best but I really like the unit that I saw today obviously you guys saw I mean all the finishes are really nice I don't even know if I have video the bathroom but it's really nice just like pretty tile work very clean the building felt really safe to me I really liked the area like there's really not many Hanz except that there's no doorman and no elevator which obviously I guess those are cons but it's not like undoable and it's basically around the same price it's actually a little bit less than what I'm paying in Boston right now but I'm sure that by the time I factor and everything and moving expenses and stuff like that like you know it's fine my parents were like you really need to rethink this because it is very small it is super so I mean like you walk into it my parents like where's the other room because we're just used to my place in Boston which is like I'm so fortunate it's a little bit bigger I think now I'm just used to bigger places but I'm so down to consolidate I just really like this unit but I feel weird now because it's the only unit that I saw we drove around the area and like some other apartments that are doing only virtual tours but we got to see the area and those are all really nice too but obviously I got to get in this apartment so I texted the realtor and he said that I could put down the deposit basically if you guys don't know New York real estate it's my first time doing it too so I don't really know what I'm doing either but there's this thing called a good-faith deposit so basically you put down it's a thousand dollars which is a ton of money this stuff is crazy to me you put down a thousand dollars and then you fill out the application and if you don't get it you get the money back and if you do get it it goes towards your first month the first step is to submit a good-faith deposit of a thousand dollars this will go towards first month's rent or will be refunded if your app gets rejected for any reason I will then send you the application and a list of required documents for the application to qualify you need to show income of 40 times rent I think that's crazy I mean I I can afford it thank gosh I really don't want out my parents as co-signers I haven't had my parents as co-signers actually in my last apartment either but I didn't want to do that for New York and have a credit of 700 Plus once the app has approved you'll sign the lease and pay first month's rent - a thousand dollars and one month securities we have to pay two months rent than at first and I feel like I remember watching like Michelle reads videos and things like that and then saying that but I was like that's a ton of money like whatever yeah you do so I didn't decide yet I just text him and said like I'm interested and then he just said that back so I have to go talk to my parents and decide what we're gonna do I've shown New York real estate moves fast I'm just thinking a lot of things no I wasn't planning on moving this soon but I found this unit and I really liked it and then I know that things get taken this would be for a July move-in by the way - but then I just brought it up with my parents like when is the world going back to normal because I don't want to move to New York and run into the same issue of like everything is still closed and I can't go anywhere because I'm moving to New York I want to be able to like socialize and stuff because especially over the summer like a hot New York summer just cramped up in my apartment that doesn't sound fun but in New York summer where I can actually go out and do things does sound fun so it's a lot to think about right now there's no right answer for what to do right now so I don't really know we also got that delicious food and now my stomach is full but I did get a coffee because I was hitting that afternoon slump we zipped home and it's 3:30 now and I have a lot of work to do except we were obviously like in the city all morning we toured at 11:00 so and we left for the city of like 9:30 or whatever so I've just been doing all that this morning but I'm gonna drink my iced coffee I got a venti cold brew with soy milk and some pumps of sugar-free vanilla and the nitro laid so no straw no so really thirsty go drink some water I have a ton of packages to open and I know this is weird now because it's half moving vlog half regular vlog I really wanted this to be a more so like moving vlog touring up for touring important's trying apartments and stuff like that but I only saw the one and I guess you guys will just stay updated with what I'm doing I know there's gonna be a lot of mixed opinions on the internet people Tommy oh you should move now it's great deals and there are amazing deals on real estate right now in New York like I this unit probably would be way more expensive had it not be for The Times and the timing of the world but then I know people are gonna say don't move to the city in the middle of coronavirus so I completely agree and I sympathize with both points and that's why I'm really torn right now so that's what's up and everyone on my Instagram I posted Instagram of me in the city like with the mask on everyone's like are you moving like tomorrow so I'm not but I just like looked at a place today so I just post a picture me in this that's that and then I know there was a bunch of questions I'm like what I'm doing with my car um my parents are gonna take this car and put it somewhere I don't know I don't even know where you guys I don't know what they're gonna do with it exactly my mom might use it as like a work hard at some point I don't know technically it was my car but I never paid for it so just being totally transparent got that so I will no longer have a car you don't really need a car to live in Manhattan I feel like and this area that I would live in I can hopefully walk everywhere that I mostly need to go or take the subway alright guys so now we're gonna do some halls while I'm here my kitchen my actually my bathing suit on underneath this because it is such a warm day I immediately got home and it was like wow I guess I'm gonna go sit outside and enjoy the sunshine got a little warm so I figured let's do the hall so first up we're gonna start off the thrive market I know you guys love a good grocery haul slash like products hauled not really actually I saw this discussion going in the gals on-the-go Facebook group a lot of you guys said that you like like grocery hauls and stuff like that but you don't like clothing hauls which i think is interesting because i'm kind of like in the same boat but I love grocery haul so hopefully like this this is another thrive market hall I paid for this entirely with my own money I think I might have gotten a small discount because we are working with them forgot something on the podcast but I am still so patiently waiting for them to sponsor me on YouTube so there I have market if you see this I know the talking point so please sponsor me cuz I love it this is my second thrive market box it shipped so fast it was actually kind of I think I ordered this like two or three days ago and I just pay the membership myself so I'm really excited bout this okay so first off I got a bag of BCAA grain free tortilla chips we did like a Mexican night the other night as family we didn't even have to retain chips and I was like damn and I just got frustrated and out of these two my box I like them they're definitely a little healthy tasting but they're good I got two bags of smart sweets these are just great I've been really snacking a lot at night and that's what is my downfall so I got these to have in the snack drawer make a healthier choice I got this this is really random this is an herbal eczema treatment which I know is so random but I have been getting some patches of like eczema on my face actually recently you can't really see any right now cuz I makeup on but I really wanted to try like a more natural treatment for it because I tried other ones but I saw this on the website and had really good reviews so let's give it a shot I think that was like ten dollars oh I got some lip balms I just wanted to try some new lip balms these are the dr. Bronner's peppermint oil I think these were like two or three dollars each I love to keep just like a chapstick in my car or just honestly my purse even though I'm not like going many places these days but I want to stay to date on the chopstick game I'll let you guys know if I like those I got some cotton rounds these are organic cotton rooms for my Bioderma like micellar water I used to take off their makeup which I think has been helping me keep my skin really clear I used to use a makeup like removing oil switched to the Bioderma again and my skin cleared up so I think that's a really good product if you guys are looking I'm excited to try this brand cuz if I like it I'm gonna order it in a bigger container these are the wandering bear cold Brews they're really strong and they have like 300 milligrams of caffeine in each of these which is like a ton I definitely will mix it with like ice and water and make it into like a little iced coffee I'm gonna throw these in the fridge it just says cold brew your coffee on the go galio coffee on the go straight black really excited to try these so that's a little I just black iced coffee they have this in a bigger container that you can get it has like a tap it's like a cold brew on top it was like 20 bucks or something but I wanted to try in the smaller size before I commit to the bigger size you know excited to try that those in the fridge oh I know this is and then the final thing I got you guys know we love our chopped salads in this house and I wanted to try a new dressing this is the primal kitchen which I love their dressings cilantro lime avocado oil dressing and marinade I just thought I would try it sounded good I like avocado and lime oh it's cilantro lime avocado lime I don't even know I just thought it would be good like a nice little vinaigrette II I don't like too much dressing but just like a nice splash it makes it fun so that's the thrive market haul let's see what else we got and now for the clothing haul portion of this video I got this matching set from one of you guys killer dyes I saw it on Kenzie's Instagram and I was like obsessed and she made me a scent - she's the best so I got the matching sweat shirt and shorts these are literally like their Sophie shorts and just an oversized sweatshirt precising reference I got an XL top and a large bottom if that helps any of you guys out and she is so sweet and made my mom is watch her - I love this pattern maybe you could just say like dye powder in that Brooke God I'm not over the tie-dye trendy and I'm still going strong on it guys I got two pieces from her at SIA which is kind of shocking I normally don't splurge on clothing that I found two pieces I really liked I did try these on before but I was wearing a bra and it just wasn't really a look so I'm just show you guys I know without the try on it means basically nothing but you know sorry I'll get better in the future this is just a top that I really liked because it has removable straps it is like a linen shirt but it's like one of those bustier type shirts I have another one it's a bodysuit like this from princess Polly and it's really flattering just on my figure I think like larger boobs figure this with dark jeans I thought would be pretty or this also paired with white pants for like a summer I'm trying to do more of that like the monochromatic stuff I just really fell in love with it specifically this one to another investing in myself moment oh by the way I got the top in a 10 and it is tight and I got this dress in an 8 so this is just a black dress I like the straight-across also for a larger chest and I just realized that I don't have basic dresses these days if I wanted to dress up I don't really wear like I'm not gonna wear like a little black dress or anything like that but at the same time like something like this for an event or just whatever I could just slip it on and it could just be like easy compare leather jacket pair denim jacket it could go a ton of different ways I really like it has a little slit here in the leg so yeah the aid fits me well it's comfortable in the back because it's like stretchy so it's a little adjustable this was expensive too but the quality I don't know I don't know I'm not gonna be doing too much shopping from expensive brands anymore ok someone hold me to it a bunch of stuff from babe lash this is just like they've sent me this kit before to I'm excited to try these brightening under-eye gel patches but you guys might know maybe I use the iconic combo to grow my eyelashes out I'll use this one day and then this the other day really really like these and I just put it on right before I go to bed just a thin line it is a little pricey but I've definitely seen more expensive on the market for like lash growing serums and stuff like that so for the price I think these are very that's to do it they also sent me mascara eyebrow filler and a plumping lip jelly which will just go in like my PR that I have that I'm gonna like give to friends or whatever so thank you so much babe lash for the products this is exciting not working with case to find this video but I thought this was very cool they sent me two of their cloth masks a black and white and I was like oh yeah like normal like whatever these actually have a activated carbon filter in them a lot of you guys have been saying I've been wearing those really cute masks that I wore in this video from reused masks but they're literally just a piece of cloth and I got some comments from you guys like it's cute and all Brooke but it's not doing anything cuz it does have a filter so apparently you're supposed to wear mask with filter I don't know I think we're all learning and improving it as we go so but these do have a filter I didn't even know that cased if I had masks I know that they donate masks but I didn't know that they sold them so I'll try those and really pumped about this they sent me more of the sanitizing wipes for your phone I use these on my computer - and you get them free with any purchase right now so not sponsored I just freaking love case defy you guys know that yeah 300 my gosh I know we could be matching it's the same as mine where'd you get it her name is Killa dies she's a subscriber look it matches my like gray and I told her that you don't need any bottoms cuz you wouldn't wear shorts you do look very nice when she did this for yeah she was like doesn't Deena want anything so we'll link it down below fo sho very impressive I know so I just got stressed and picked off my nails because that's what you do I guess when you sit in for the couch we've been watching mine hunter now my mom my dad and I there are definitely some rated-r scenes though it's one of those where I'm like all right we gotta fast forward through this part when watching is a family but if you know what I mean you know what I mean if you guys listen to girl's gotta eat Ashley talks about how like some shows you just can't watch with your dad and it's like one of those in some parts but the actual rest of the show is incredible I really have to take off my makeup it's basically all rubbed off I just want to wait for right now sir I just used this I decided need to give my nails a break from the press-on nails for a sec just because they are pretty weak a lot of you guys have asked if it's damaging to my natural nail and I feel like it probably is and they just don't look the best but whatever this is the back to life repair recuperate and glow from nails Inc so hopefully that works want to conclude my thoughts on the New York thing because obviously that's what we did today in this vlog I texted back with the real turn I decided not to go for this unit I just think July wonder for a moment is too soon obviously if it was like the perfect perfect all-around unit I would have sucked it up and made it work because I wouldn't want to pass up on like my dream apartment and it was a fantastic apartment I think and I sent it to a lot of people who live in New York like New York youtubers did you guys probably know and many of them said that it is a great unit and like it's a you know for the price and everything but it's just too soon for me right now like I don't really want to move in July first like I said unless the perfect unit comes up so that's the conclusion so I texted the realtor for that listing and I said like hey I'm gonna pass look if anything else pops up that you know like in the building or whatever in a few weeks like let me know especially for August hopefully things improved by then but it was still a really fun day and a really cool experience that we got to go in and check it out obviously wore masks and everything it was also the first New York City like one-bedroom apartment I ever toured I like have visited friends that live in the city and stuff before of course but like does my first one that I toured also my parents and I talked about it I really do want to look at buildings with a doorman obviously I don't think I'm a popular person at all like I don't even me like that but for the nature of what I do and things like that like I think for my own safety it's important to think about that I know this is like really like four packages and Mail purposes I get a lot of those things and I can't really have those left out on the street but more so for safety and my own comfort of knowing like I'm a single girl like living in the city he pretty young and I think it would be best maybe if I started looking at buildings with the doorman which obviously brings it to a whole nother price range which stresses me out immensely but do know that I am being smart here so like I said chill home for a few more months so I know that this bug was probably so confusing to most people that I would she's moving now like what but we were just gonna go look and take a drive and a walk around the city and like look at some areas today and you know it ended up that this one was really great really thankful that we got to see cuz it's gonna put everything else now into perspective like if I go and tour something else in like two or three weeks from now I'll be able to compare it to this one of my head and be like it was nicer it wasn't as nice for the price you know so that's the conclusion I also have been talking to a lot of people like what's the situation right now are people leaving the city are people going to the city I'm pretty much everybody's leaving the city which is good I feel like for the real estate and for me of course but do I want to move to a city that everyone's moving out of right now like it's kind of weird I don't really know what to do so I'm asking you for your advice please let me know down below what you guys think please be kind and let's take a shot I get cozy for bed I have like no really chill podcast listen to some battles into a little literal like productivity podcast wash our but you know it is 10:20 I can't wait for this I have a way to voice one it up hi guys another day since this vlog I I'm sure it's already quite long I'm gonna go ahead
