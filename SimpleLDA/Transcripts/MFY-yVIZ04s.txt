 Robin Thicke don't even get me started don't do it don't you know that was my man right I've hit Kanye West in the restroom I could barely get my dress up like my dress was like half off like this and he comes out and we were like hey guys I know I know I know my bad has been one day has been two days I'm not sure because all the days are squished together now guys I'm sorry today I took care of my goddaughter Aubrey if you guys follow me on instagram you might have seen my stories the reason why she was over here is because we are obviously not leaving her house the only place that I go to really it's just to get food and to go to the post office I had to give my sister a break listen a lot of you parents out there can understand you need a break right me and my younger sister are going really hard on this quarantine thing so we haven't seen anybody girl I haven't even seen my mom well and as you guys know she's dealing with the shingles so I'm not trying to see her anyway but I haven't really been seeing anybody and our Bible studies keep getting prolonged and like put off or canceled because there's just so many different factors we have essential workers that are in our group too so it's really scary and you don't want to get sick if you guys follow me on social media you probably have seen some of my stories of us doing yoga together some activities today I think it's always fun for kids to go to someone else's house to play with some else's toys and eat different foods and stuff now that I'm getting a moment to breathe I looked at the time which where's my phone at around here somewhere I looked at the time and I'm like crap it's almost five o'clock again so I think I've missed maybe two days maybe going on my third day and I didn't want to be like completely gone so even though this vlog is going to be late I wanted to make sure that I posted so that you guys know that I'm still like with you just going through the motions of Turin teen I don't even remember what day it is unless I check the calendar so many of my zoom meetings conference calls I even had to go over like my finances with my financial planner luckily for me I've been blessed with such a great job here on YouTube hi-oh a lot of money it's all good it's all good the Lord takes care of me and I'm not gonna complain hopefully this is not like to movie for you guys that you guys get motion sickness and I'm hoping I'm still in focus I am also going to be starting a podcast I was wondering how many of you guys would actually even listen to that do you guys even listen to podcasts pretty much I'm going to end up taking my storytimes and moving it to the podcast realm that way I don't really have to censor myself too much because here on YouTube I really have to like be careful what I say I mean not that I'm like crazy or would say anything like disrespectful or saying anything offensive I just don't want to be censored in the in the sense where me my friends can't talk openly about very controversial topics Sark's you all know I love Jesus but one of my favorite words is I can't help it I can't help it not to do it well that wall this is my podcast you guys my sister also just bought a house right as is career stuff happened and my goddaughter Aubrey just turned three years old so imagine moving into a house where your kids running around I decided to take one for the team one for the mom team and take care of her daughter today well she got to relax and of course me time and mommy language means doing things around the house without your kid harassing you she was painting and then also making tons and tons of masks which were awesome because she gave Jude and I four of them you can't just wear masks like these over and over and over again it's gross can imagine if the dentist or the doctor surgical doctor wore those over and over and over again with each patient like if you have one of these kinds of masks we can wash them you're supposed to wash them every time that you go out don't even get me started with the gloves the people who are out there ring gloves you know you're like spreading germs all over the place and then you get into your car you're talking on your phone with your gloves like to know that defeats the purpose of wearing gloves literally doctors wear at different gloves with each patient that they see because if they use the same ones over Wow even the people at Subway they're making your freaking sandwiches change gloves and wash your hands it's protocol come on anyways Jesus of masks my sister made me so cute right also one of my subscriber Turner friends made some really cool masks for us to all shoot there in the car I want to show this to you guys maybe tomorrow and then Jude's TK teacher made one for me too these little dogs on it TK teacher you guys I wasn't even a student must have made an impression she was thinking about us and she made me one I thought that was so sweet this one actually comes with like a little pouch to put a filter is this a weird flip this is a weird flex y'all that I have multiple masks the weird flex I'm just waiting for designers to come out with face masks I can't I can't if anything it reminds you to floss your damn teeth and if you have cavities I'm sorry dude can you shut your door please damn I can't you think every time a thought would come to my head and he would interrupt me by yelling with his cousin's on the yes I had Jude has a head set and he's like talking so freaking loud I don't even know why just memory popped in my head but that I okay so for missus in 2015 or 2014 I was backstage at the Grammys and I was getting my hair and makeup done I got to walk the red carpet super cool I love those kinds of experiences I love doing red carpet interviews because that's super fun one of my favorite people to actually interview had to have been Gina Rodriguez and I will never forget it now I know she fell into some controversy she was so cool when I met her she even gave me a hug and a kiss girl the reporters were like how you know her I'm like no I don't know her I just latina we kiss everybody like I literally will hug and kiss you if you're in my arms reach it's going down I got fake outfit anyways I'm distracted I have shorts on okay chill ah hopefully this is like okay for where I'm sitting his like my arms aren't starting to shake from holding it okay so what happened was I went to the Grammys with a brand and I want to say was L'Oreal Paris but it might have been only or caress I don't remember so I was getting dressed in a makeshift like dressing room but it was like shared restrooms on one side it was like a bunch of chairs and mirrors do you have your make hair makeup done on the other sides the same thing and down the middle was like a walkway so there was a bunch of makeshift tents I kind of look like when you would go to a haunted house and they would make all these rooms but really it's just like piping and curtains and you would just like move the curtains and you can get into those rooms and on each room was like a piece of paper that was stapled and it told you what was the name of the artist that was inside so as I'm walking to go to my dressing room which it really wasn't a dressing room okay I wasn't cool enough but it got cool so let me tell you right across from me with hozier things ain't right poacher man and next to them was uh sure pitbull Ricky Martin was there too I don't know why he had a dressing room though cuz I don't think he even frickin performed it doesn't matter and then next door to me with Kim and Kanye West someone else was on the other side of me so like I'm right here I know where the restroom is so the stars has no choice but to pass me to get to the restroom trying to be professional trying to keep it cute cuz you know I'm there too I'm getting my hair and makeup done too okay so uh she walks in Robin Thicke don't even get me started don't do it don't you know that was my man right until he cheated on Paula then I was over her skirt I didn't want anything to do with him ill can't with cheaters after my last story time of the cheating guy I know I never tolerated cheatin ever again so they came through and I was like shocked right and I was trying to keep it cool and they were doing my hair and makeup and they're filming it so it's not like I could jump out of the chair and like jump on top of Robin Thicke after I got my hair and makeup done I had a change into a second look and I'm in the handicap stall not because I'm rude it's just literally they had it set it up for me that I could change into my different outfits because I didn't have like a legit dressing room you know whatever so I'm in there getting dressed and at the time I am with my ex-boyfriend who I'll just climb sugar because that's what I called him I don't talk about him anymore who was holding up my clothes we were just trying to hurry up and you know get changed someone walked into the restroom and he was he goes oh my god someone just walked into the restroom find you I'm happy okay literally covered in head-to-toe Spanx I was like mortified that someone was gonna see me someone had popped up behind sugar and was like kind of like trying to see like what is going on in here put his arm up like what the Frick get out of here so the guy goes into the restroom sugar goes oh my god someone's in her what and then you hear a voice come out from the stall goes yeah that someone is Kanye West I'm like what I could barely get my dress up like my dress is like half off like this and he comes out and we were like oh it's really Kanye West I don't get shocked like that I really don't I've seen so many celebrities and a lot of them don't even look like half the way they look on camera or on in pictures because there's so much editing crazy lighting and stuff and he was so sweet - he was like hi nice to meet you and I asked him can I shake your hand he's like I just use the restroom you know even thinking and they both come in him and Kim Kardashian come in so we were both like what the Frick that I couldn't believe that really freaking happened I guess it wasn't that crazy but you know what I mean like I guess it could have been cooler but I thought it was cool I've hit Kanye West in the restroom and I asked to shake his hand and he didn't wash it imagine oh now oh my god no no I'm not sure I get the corona from you girl bye it's got four kids right
