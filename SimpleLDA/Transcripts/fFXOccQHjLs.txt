  hello hi everyone welcome back it's me Jenny I'm in Colorado I have been wreak warrant eating here I'm from Colorado I am back in my hometown I am in an air B&B that I am renting for a month and then gonna play it by ear on if I stay here longer or not for a few different reasons I decided to relocate for the time being which I'm not going to get into super in-depth but definitely was the right choice for me to be a little bit closer to home and in a less chaotic environment for like health reasons etc so I'm here and I have to say it has been really nice my home town is very small it's there's a lot more room for social distancing and still being able to be outside and be safe while you're doing that so yeah I'm happy to be here and kind of like out of the eye of the storm for a bit and I'm gonna do a little vlog today and over the next few days I think just like some bits and pieces I'm here staying with a friend who's also quarantine with me so that's been good and just show you what I've been doing while I've been here I've been here for about a week and a half now I guess it will probably be around 2 weeks by the time you see this and yeah  but she's pretty cute I also forgot that at high altitude you have to like account for that biggest things I've been thinking about are one like a slow slowing down I feel like everyone keeps talking about slowing down just because we're all inside but I definitely don't think that Nestle necessarily means that we're actually slowing down so being here I've actually been able to tap into this sense of calm that I have not felt in a very long time which I'm really glad just to be like back in my hometown for this long I haven't been back here for this long for years so that's been really nice and have been doing a lot of inner thought around that idea of what it feels like to actually like get to a good place within yourselves I was reading the spikes article the other day which can be a hit or miss but I was talking about how mentally draining it is to constantly be absorbing news especially traumatic news and taking all that in on a daily basis is extremely draining which is why a lot of us have probably been feeling less productive obviously more depressed anxious all those feelings take a lot of work and also will make our physical body you feel tired I think it's good to take that into consideration so think about that  all right just got finished filming my other video okay I'm a time crunch but I'm gonna do a level yoga because I've been really enjoying it one lens now I'm working out this like period of time of being inside has been like the first time I've been consistently working out in a very long time biggest takeaway has been this idea of like feeling very stagnant at home not moving enough and it's really easy to feel like your brain and your body are not like connected in that way where like you're feeling very stagnant mentally you're also probably feeling a lot of that in your body which I realized I really was and just doing the simplest movements getting your heart rate up moving breathing a little bit has been helping me a lot through this process but yeah it definitely has been very helpful for me I was just taking a break I'm gonna do ABS and maybe like another hit workout because I'm feeling a little bit energised today so I'm gonna take advantage of that feeling okay just finished working out came out here to this little enclosed patio which is my favorite part of this place that I'm saying quickly wanted to talk about today sponsored which is where he gave me the basics I'm really excited to be working with them they're this beautiful small brand based out of Denmark they focus on organic basics so they have underwear tank tops activewear t-shirts things like that and I just immediately became very interested in them because they have a really cool emphasis on sustainable fabric so I'm going to break down their different lines for you really quickly because I found I'm really interesting all the ways that they've incorporated really great fabrics for the earth so to start off what they have their organic cotton LED which uses got certified caught in you might be more familiar with working at kind but it uses less water than traditional cotton doesn't use pesticides or harsh chemicals that are harmful for the environment and crops their cotton is sourced from Turkey and also made in Turkey for this line I love that they are very transparent on where each line is also made and produce fairly okay so there's soft touch line this line has touched my heart it is so so soft tank top I'm wearing is there soft touch line and I have not taken off since I received it these QT underwear that I have this nice little organic basics logo so this line is made from tencel or lyocell you might have heard of that name before so basically tensile is made from the wood pulp of eucalyptus trees at the cellulose fiber it uses about 80 percent less water than cotton to produce so it's a lot lighter on the environment as a fabric it's also a lot more breathable super super soft I definitely would prefer it over cotton in my humble opinion this is just yeah really soft um they also have their invisible line here they went into recycled textiles so they use a recycled nylon for this line creating kind of invisible basics they're very stretchy but also very like form-fitting which I find really helpful have their solar tech active line which is what you just saw me working out and it's awesome recycled nylon but they use a blue sign approved finish that's anti-odor is actually made from recycled silver salt treatment so a lot of different types of fabrics traditionally are sprayed with very harsh toxic chemicals that we don't know about so I think it's really cool that they found an alternative way to also create activewear that is anti odor and has some of these cool properties but it's also done in sustainable way so overall very impressed with all their products all of them really great fit style throughout the pandemic they have also been donating to the UN refugee agency they're just all around a really beautiful brand so I'm happy to support them in any way they can if you want to get 10% off your first purchase you can use a little discount code linked below in the description but yeah I'm gonna hang out here maybe read a book for a bit and then I'm gonna go jump in the river
