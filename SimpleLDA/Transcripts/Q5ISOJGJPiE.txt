   good day everyone welcome back to my youtube channel if it's your first time joining this is Catan Julie from Queens New York today is May 18 2020 and Here I am doing another vlog and how it is to live in New York City during quarantine today is a workday and I just finished working so I decided to come outside and take some fresh air I have been trying to do my afternoon walk here and there when the weather is good so I've been working from home since March 16 of 2020 and boy hasn't been the transition as soon as though I have a nice little flow going for me like to share this routine that I have been living by for the last two months or so I pretend as though I'm going to the office but I'm really not so what that means I wake up I you know brush my teeth take a shower pray have a cup of tea and I dress as though I am going to the office I feel as though by doing that a mentally program to think that I am actually going into the office and at work we utilize our zoom and jabber to interact with our colleagues and our stakeholders so you know you always have to be presentable and you're representing yourself and your company so just something to be aware of so yeah I feel like I tried my best to incorporate a 30 minute lunch break and and coffee breaks where I go to my kitchen I make coffee or tea and I feel like you know is just like being in the office but this is that I'm working from home and I created a space in my tiny apartment where it is dedicated offer you know     there's this area in my neighborhood a super-rich so quarantine has developed my confidence and now I had the courage to invite myself into this beautiful and rich area in the neighborhood okay let me give you guys a preview I hope I don't get it to trouble    my dad works part-time at JFK Airport and he gets all these like goodies for me so he got me a bunch of baklava and I usually have one of this with coffee before I I you know call it a night thank you all for watching my vlog I really hope my high-level morning quarantine routine was somehow helpful to you and as I do more vlogs I'll give more details and perhaps share a checklist that I used every morning during the work week and I also hope you enjoy my little tour I took in my neighborhood thanks again the please don't forget to subscribe to my youtube channel if you want to see future videos stay safe
