 wow hey guys welcome back my name is athena and today's gonna be a really productive day so i'm just gonna show you along and show you a little day in my life but it's already 10 30 so yeah i really need to get out but okay first off i need to make my bed okay so right now i'm just applying my daily facial cleanser from center film and i think it works pretty nicely gotta take my band out okay so after i applied it to the entire face i'm just gonna let it sit for like a minute or two and then while i do that i always brush my teeth during it to save some time so now that i've done brushing my teeth i'm gonna wash my face too aveeno daily moisturizer supply a little bit of that and i really like how it has spf 15 so it makes me feel like  moisturizing cream from my doctor because i get some dry patches um in some areas my neck tends to get really dry you can also grab my lips now i'm gonna get dressed okay for some reason this always pops up every single day it's so weird oh td i just put my hair in a bun and then i put this little head wrap um just a pink t-shirt and black jeans so this is my makeup i didn't do any mascara because i'm going on a run later and i didn't feel like wearing mascara on the run yeah i'm getting really hungry right now so let's go make some breakfast i mean brunch it's already 11 15. wow it's actually really good i did not expect it to be that good here's the edom that i'm making right now just udon fish balls and bok choy that's it very simple and also add some soy sauce and salt oh my god i just carried it back to my room and my hands hurt so bad oh to add a little bit of spice and flavor and i'm gonna eat it up now so this is what i wrote out for me to do today i'm pretty sure i need to do some other stuff too was under last week because i still haven't done maze setup yet so that's part of my task but right now i'm gonna do my diary because i know that's gonna take really long and i'm not gonna do it if i do other stuff first all right so this is my diary yesterday i caught up till february 29th and today is currently may 2nd so yeah i still have march april and the first day of may jk today is may 3rd so i have march april and the first two days of my schedule literally been procrastinating since december because in december i stopped for two months and then i wrote a couple weeks worth of diary entries and i stopped for two months again and then i wrote sarah andrews again and last night i went from february 10th to february 29th it literally takes so long to just write one dire entry and the only way i'm remembering everything is by looking through my camera roll and then because i take pictures like literally every day i just click on the picture specific to that day and then i'll try to remember what happened during that day because i feel like i'm a really good visual learner and sorry if i'm talking weird because i have like a heavy band and usually i put on medium band so it's pulling on my teeth and it's just really weird turn this on oh my god guys i started at 12 30 and right now it's 4 58 so i've literally been doing this for the past five hours but i'm so happy that i'm finally caught up now and i can finally start writing in it on the actual day again for the past couple months i've just been like procrastinating and just like storing all the memories in my head my hands are so tight right now i can't i did not expect me to spend this long on my stupid diary but i wrote a lot i guess i didn't expect me to write that much i just had lots of feelings stored up from all the stuff that has happened these past couple months these past couple months have been pretty crazy i gotta make in like 50 years when i look back at this i'm gonna be like wow corona really hit you hard huh i'm gonna go on a run now i think i yeah i'm going to do a running challenge where i run 30 minutes every single day for a month as a video idea i'll watch out for that if i stick to that challenge so i don't have any desire to i'm back for my rug obviously let me just tell that was a huge ass struggle i ran like three blocks and then i was gonna run around this mall that's like really close to my house then i stopped and it ran around neighborhoods because i was too embarrassed about how slow i was going and i already had a cramp literally dying the entire time but i guess that's okay if that always happens to me on the first day but i just feel so bad myself and i did a plank when i went home and i just stretched a little bit hopefully tomorrow will be better 30 minutes isn't even that much i'm gonna go shower and then get some  done because i have a lot more to do today hey guys i just finished eating dinner and then i ate half a bag of salmon and bread chips so just
