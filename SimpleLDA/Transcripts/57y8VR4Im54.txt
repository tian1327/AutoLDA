 what's up everyone is Ashley and welcome back to my channel so I live in New York City New York City is currently under a huge lockdown as is most of the country here in New York right now we have about 60,000 cases in the entire state and where I am in New York City we have 30,000 I have been self-quarantine for about two weeks I have not left my apartment for anything and today I have to go get groceries and I thought I would take you with me obviously following all the precautions I'm not gonna be walking down the streets of New York and not being mindful of who's around and I'm certainly if the stores are too crowded or too small or too stressful I'm not gonna be worried about filming but I did want to show you what it looks like because I haven't been outside in two weeks the CDC says that we're allowed to go out for necessities we're allowed to even go for a walk by herself if we want to and that's what I'm gonna do today but before I go I'm gonna make some preparations I am going to hand make ignore my closet is broken I need someone to help me fix it but obviously I'm not going to be able to have anyone come over and do that but I have two things I'm gonna do before I leave today I'm gonna make a mask I know that there has been information saying that masks are not effective or it's just conflicting information about everything to be honest but for me I will feel more comfortable if I have a mask and at the very least it will remind me not to touch my face and then I'm also going to be making some disinfectant wipes which I will show you how to do as well so I have cleared off my desk here this desk is super old it's a little bit beat up that's just where we are that's just what I have so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and start making this mask DIY disinfecting wipes disinfectant wipes wipes to disinfect basically just need paper towels you need rubbing alcohol that is at least 70% proof a plastic bag or something to put them in and also something to mix your mixture in is super simple this is very strong do your own research decide what's best for you I am NOT an expert I am following recipes that I have seen online for my own personal use you do your own research make the wisest decisions for yourself and just be careful be wise be mindful so yeah let me open up a window because you definitely need a lot of ventilation when you're working with rubbing alcohol so this might change my lighting situation here let's move the procedure to another area one second all right so instead of making me as at my desk we're gonna make them at my windowsill I normally have like my laundry stuff and my iron sitting here but I moved it for the purposes of this video let's open our window you need a lot of ventilation when you're working with this kind of stuff the cool thing about living in New York is that I have a I have a cool fire escape but and my neighbors can definitely see everything that I do through the windows and once a neighbor up there decided it would be a cool thing to stand out his window naked yes eight open very much my window keeps closing what this book okay we might have to change windows here never mind I think I figured out the problem we can stay at this window okay also my neighbor my neighbor keeps playing with her window I think she might be watching me so they take however many however many you want to do I'm gonna do I guess we'll do a lot just because I'm gonna take some with me to the store and then I'm also going to have some here to disinfect my groceries I'm actually going to cut these in half and I'll grab the alcohol in the water that's pretty much all you need water alcohol and dish soap you need something to to mix them in I'm going to put my cup of water into here then I'm going to put some FD dish soap in there now whole reason we're here at the window just eyeball it maybe I'll put a little bit more just to be safe okay oh and I mix it up just using my scissors and so I'm gonna cut these in half too now I'm going to take these and put them into a plastic bag I'm gonna take these with me to the store when I go because like I said I don't know I don't know what to expect when I go out I don't know if they're getting outside anyway but what I think I'm gonna do is I'm gonna actually make some more paper towels and then I'm just going to pour this in my bathroom over the sink so that I don't make a mess on myself and then I'll show you the final result all right so I poured the mixture into here I didn't pour the entire mixture so I put the lid back on that coffee container and I'll have it for later if I want to make more but yeah you just saturate it until you think it's enough now I'm gonna get ready to go out so let's see how this goes it was definitely a really weird going out I haven't been out of my apartment in two weeks well there were two stores I want it to go to that we're right next to each other one is more of a health food store where they have vitamins which I wanted to get and a lot of vegetarian stuff the other store sells just like just like regular everyday things and is a little less pricey so I decided because the health food store had online I would go to the other store I got a little anxious in the regular shore because I realized the reason why there wasn't a line is because they weren't regulating how many people were in the store and it was literally impossible to socially distance it was impossible to keep yourself sink 6 feet away from people at all times in the store and I decided that I would just get the rest of the stuff at the health food store because at least they were kind of regulating how many people were going in in both stores everything was pretty much stocked the health food store I was really surprised that they were out of tofu they were also out of these noodles that I really like that are kind of like a healthy ramen noodle and they were also surprisingly out of a lot of the ice creams as well and out of the non-dairy cheeses but obviously there's like more things in the world to complain about like I'm not upset but I will say that it was really eye-opening going out because I didn't know what to expect it was like two things were happening on one end it felt kind of crazy to see not a lot of people were wearing masks I only saw one other person with a homemade mask and then my mask got loose so it ended up falling down to my neck and I thought that it would just not be it would just not be a good idea to put it back but that's touching my face so I don't know if this mask is gonna really be cutting it but going out just felt a little bit grounding but it was also stressful too because it's stressful Wow I need to clear off this table and sanitize it because I'm gonna sanitize to the best of my abilities my groceries I'm gonna link below a video of a doctor who has shared some really good technique okay I can't talk oh my gosh heck Nick's on how to best sanitize everything and I'm just gonna try to do that I forgot to get toilet paper but there was plenty of it and went out of toilet paper and I have some from last time I went out so I was fine anyway I'm gonna do this now and then try to reel a card I thought I would show you what I got as I go along so these are still on the dirty side I haven't wiped them off I'm using my disinfectant wipes but I got two two frozen pizzas veggie cheese veggie meat so this stuff has been wiped down this is broccoli florets some french fries more vegan cheese arugula some salmon and then this is I believe a vegetarian pork more frozen vegetables there so there's that okay so this is round 2 for everything that I have cleaned up so this is a hot and sour soup that I got it is dr. McDougall which I really really like this is another one I got which is the tortilla soup these are just good for something to have pretty quickly and they're really really tasty and they're not too expensive so I have cucumber I got butter because I want to do baking I bought this vegetarian chicken salad that I like a hummus I made sure to get a larger hummus just because I I really do love hummus and I'm trying not to go out again for a while baby carrots this is my favorite brand of peanut butter ever the peanut butter company they were out of every other type except for maple and chocolate so I just got the maple and I said before I want to try to make Japanese souffle pancakes and it might be kind of good to try to make a topping with the maple peanut butter I think that'll be pretty good I also have my adoptive parents were so funny they were like make sure you get vitamin make sure you get a vitamin so I'm definitely gonna be taking vitamins now especially since I'm not really going out very much this has vitamin D in it which you typically get from the Sun but I'm not going out then yes I did go to the liquor store I got some vodka whiskey and some fireball that's because sometimes we drink on cam and I'm really just trying to stock up for a while here this is the last little bit of my haul I always find the candles to be something that calm me and soothe me I love a good candle so just to add a little bit of comfort in my environment I got a new one so they had almond breeze on sale two four five and I am gonna be using I use almond milk in my smoothies I use it in my coffee and I'm going to be using it too in a lot of my baking this week so it's good to have those I was out of ketchup definitely needed that and I got some Tapatio here which is one of my favorite hot sauces yes I also have two bottles of wine this is Chloe wine and it's a Chardonnay and it's really really good and then I have all-purpose flour because like I keep saying I'm gonna be baking hopefully some bread some cookies some souffle pancakes all of that so I'm gonna put these away and then I will show you the fresh fruits and vegetables that I got that I need to wash off in the sink so I got a couple oranges because vitamin C is super important they're saying I got four lemons because I'm so obsessed with lemon and lemon water it just makes me feel really good when I drink it avocados because I was really really craving them some apples I got a red onion and I also have two yellow onions and I have a red pepper oh and I also have some tomatoes as well so yeah that's my grocery haul it is kind of a lot but I'm trying to just stay in for the next two weeks so we shall see how that goes and yeah I'll see you in a little bit all right so I just infected my phone my camera my wallet everything now I am just gonna put everything back on my desk here now it's about 655 for the past two nights people have been opening their windows and clapping and cheering and just basically giving it up and really showing thanks and appreciation to all of the hospital workers and all the doctors all the grocery store clerks all the delivery people on the sanitation workers all of the post-office workers all of the MTA workers basically everyone who is really working so hard to keep the city going and everyone opens up their windows and we all yell and it makes me really emotional every single time and hopefully it happens again tonight so that I can share that with you because man I just think that that is such a really beautiful thing that people are doing great starting it's not even 7:00 on the way I wanted to make this vlog today just to show a little bit a small portion of one person's life right now in New York City obviously different people are having different experiences so yeah that that was my day today in lockdown New York City everybody stays safe out there big hugs to you guys thank you for watching and I will see you next time
