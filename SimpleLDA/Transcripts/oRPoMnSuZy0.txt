   well hey there all you cool cats and kittens it's Cody from who knows what number weaknesses of quarantine if you understood that reference you like me and millions of other people wasted a whole lot of time watching a crazy documentary about Tigers which was weird but you know what today is gonna be a weird day it's currently 6:30 a.m. it's been 3 maybe 4 weeks since the last time that I went to the grocery store so this morning that's what we need to do we're out of just about everything and got a three stock out of stock back up now I can't swim this morning however the routine of waking up early in the morning and doing something physical and doing something that sucks has got to remain the same grocery store opens in five minutes gonna get in and out as fast as possible let's do this normally Ali and I go shopping together on the weekends but for obvious reasons there's only one of us needs to go and they can't find sriracha sauce but can't complain about that right now you know I mean all right we're pretty much done  I'd like to take this moment to thank everyone who is still currently running an essential business everyone at the grocery store over at the hospitals we appreciate you I talked with three different Kroger employees today all of them were super super friendly super helpful really appreciate those people and now it's time to earn to earn the laziness for the rest of the day I've got this route around my neighborhood and then around three other neighborhoods it's like this big circle that's what we're gonna do I tried to take the Helius route possible cuz you know if you're gonna do it you gotta do it you know I don't like running but with everything that's been going on I've gotten a lot better at running my running is better now that it's probably probably ever been before I do like the satisfaction I get out of completing a run or pushing through the extra couple miles that I don't really want to do similar to like when I'm in the pool I think maybe someday I'll do a triathlon I think I've been thinking a lot about doing an Ironman someday giving all the cross training that I'm doing now that is hell he's not my friend not my friend at all four miles in about halfway doing good a squirrel almost attacked me squirrel attack avoid it oh my goodness snow scores and pools pulser Oh homestretch there's no Street yes come on like hate me that's okay oh please don't kill me car please don't get me car nice definitely a swimmer space but nada not bad okay now it's time for workout number two my lawn has never looked better  my neighbor has kids and they're always hitting balls over and that got it makes me happy got to keep the Legos tree all nice and trim he likes to pee-pee on no that's his tree  with all this extra time we're doing a lot of lawn work nothing I'm good at it or anything but a lot more mowing a lot more trimming I think the key to this whole quarantine thing for me is just staying busy constantly making myself do stuff even if it's stuff I don't want to do like I don't like this stuff I've never done this stuff before I don't hate it but it's something to do it's something that needs to be done every day I make a checklist of things to do and today was finished trimming around the house yesterday I mowed it's not like that  you know I was thinking I don't love running but I do love things that are challenging and things that I can improve upon and see progress and that's one thing that you see a lot with with all these wrongs that I've been going on I've certainly got a lot better really fast same with this yard work like I'm I'm better at this now than I was like a month ago progress while I'm out here a little bit of breaking news I just landed an awesome new sponsor I can't announce who it is yet but I am getting a pool in this backyard very soon I'm gonna have my own pool here I can't share any information more information on that now but it's coming soon I'm really excited about it now that I'm sweaty and grassy it's gonna feel really good to take for the rest of the day I'll still feel okay about it oh I've spotted a wild alley a wild alley siding total honesty I played probably eight hours of fort night yesterday still worked out like still have a long CrossFit super hard workout the morning but I've been playing an awful lot of video games you know some parents might not understand this but online video games interactive video games that you do with your friends can keep you sane and sharp during times like this when you have an abundance of free time now I'm not condoning playing eight hours of straight video games which is what I did just eight hours a fortnight yesterday being able to be online was like six of my best friends and talked to them for a long period of time and play a game where you're strategizing and working with one another hand-eye coordination it's engaging it's stimulating I think that there's a lot of value and a lot of benefit to it that a lot of people might not understand once again eight hours probably a bit excessive I admit that but just the fact that I'm able to socialize and engage with people in a constructive way for a period of time yeah I think I think it has value hey Ally what are you doing in there do you wanna watch a movie or a shower or something good morning leggo good morning would you like some cheese you can't have any nope you can't have any cheese and crackers tough nut you gave him some cheddar the Karl puffs good girl oh you make me shoot I suppose I can make you some soup
