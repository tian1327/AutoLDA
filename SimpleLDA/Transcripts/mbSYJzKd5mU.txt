   okay so I just finished a brunch or breakfast whatever gonna call it and now I'm about to get my day started so basically I have a lot of work to do today this is actually gonna be a productive vlog at first I was gonna name it a chill quarantine vlog because I was just like chilling but I realized I have a lot of work to do even though that sounds hard to believe right now supposed to be on break but I do have some assignments and YouTube stuff and internship stuff to do so it's gonna be a productive day of my life hopefully so first I'm gonna clean up because you know you have to have a clean space so let's do that and I'll talk to you guys in a little  I'm not cleaning up it's one o'clock let's see how I am on my schedule so I made a little schedule yesterday last night because I really need to stick to this stuff right now it's 1 p.m. basically 1258 and on my schedule is clean room and recreate calendar so I'm kind of ahead of my schedule cuz I already cleaned my room and it's 1 p.m. so now I just have to recreate my calendar and like I said this is gonna be a productive day so I still have some work to do and financial stuff to take care of for the Stanford school year next year then work on YouTube internship stuff so this is not a chill vlogs as a productive vlog today and if you can't tell by the quality I got a new camera keys up so I got a camera that I was talking to you guys about later because right now I kinda want to stick to my schedule I had this calendar hanging in my room and as you can see it says September so this was from before I even moved to Stanford so now that I'm gonna be here for six months I need to redo my calendar   it's done it's very basic because I don't have anything to put on there and it honestly took a long time so one day I will go out and buy an actual dry erase board like white calendar but for now I just made all the boxes and stuff it's kind of messy it's not perfect but it'll do so that's another thing off my to-do list so I'm gonna go ahead and mark everything off that I've already done from my to-do list and I'm actually ahead of schedule because I'm not supposed to start my work until 2:30 but I'm ahead so that means I will be done earlier so I'm gonna try to keep this productive mood up and finish my psych assignment I woke up I had breakfast and now I have to do so I don't know if I told you guys in the last video or like any videos prior to this but they basically made all final exams optional so the essay that I had to write for psych I now no longer have to write it they just cancelled it but they did offer us an extra credit opportunity to make up the grade that we could have got if we did the test so we have to write to one-pagers about different studies so I'm just gonna go ahead and get that done and then I'm gonna do my CSS profile and if you don't know the CSS profile is basically FAFSA but more in-depth and it's provided by the College Board and Stanford uses this to determine the amount of financial aid that you're gonna get so if you applied to Stanford you probably have to do the CSS profile if you are applying for financial aid so I have to do that for the next school year I don't think it's due anytime soon but I just want to get out the way so I don't have to worry about it I've definitely been procrastinating this whole time y'all I've been chilling Netflix tik-tok Twitter everything so I'm about to do that and I will talk to you guys in a little  okay also I finished my psych assignment which I'm super happy about because I've been procrastinating that for days and that was my last assignment due for the corner so basically I'm done with winter quarter of my freshman year I turn in all my assignments did all my course evaluations and now I'm just waiting on my grades so we will see how that goes hopefully I did well but we won't know for a while because they pushed the grade deadlines back so we will see so now I'm gonna work on my CSS profile which like I said is basically just an in-depth version of the FAFSA so I'm gonna go ahead and do that and get my financial aid all squared away for next year so I don't have to worry about it later so I'm finally doing my CSS profile that probably took me like 45 minutes to do it with so much stuff I had to get the tax returns all this different information for my parents and stuff but now I'm finally done it would have cost me $25 if I didn't qualify for a few waivers that's how you know like they're just pulling costs out of nowhere like if I didn't qualify for a few waiver imagine if I had to apply to a bunch of different school send my CSS profile to a bunch of schools it would have cost $16 per school plus the $9 fee waiver like that's ridiculous they honestly need to just make it free for everybody but anyway I'm not about to rant about that let me check my to-do list and see where I'm supposed to be now I can work off and those two things and clearly I'm not supposed to be done with stuff so 5:30 I was definitely giving myself like three hours to do this work and it only took me about two hours because I started at 1:30 and the next thing on my to-do list is to do my YouTube planning camera tour Stanford update and my internship work so two of these things they're supposed to be like reminding me to explain to you guys what's going on in my life so as you can tell by the quality of this video I got a camera I got the canon g7x mark ii and i used the money I made from YouTube to kind of make an investment in my channel just to bring you guys like better-looking content better quality sound quality video quality cuz I'm really gonna start taking YouTube seriously my channel is constantly growing which I'm really thankful for so thank you so much if you're watching this video if you're subscribed if you've watched any of my videos before or anything like that go ahead and subscribe to my channel I'll be making a lot more content and while we're in quarantine though I'm really grateful to have been able to purchase this camera I think it's a really good investment in my channel and it'll just bump up the quality a lot and it makes me feel like a real like youtuber like this is something that I actually want to do so I will continue to make these videos for y'all and editing and all of that so and thanks so much for watching which kind of brings me to my next topic which is the Stanford update as I said earlier I'm gonna be home for the next six months because Stanford has just officially released an email saying that all Spring Quarter classes for the whole quarter are online so Spring Quarter was set to start on March 30th I have a flight already scheduled back to campus for March 29th that I have to go and cancel what we were supposed to start Spring Quarter on March 30th I would have flew back went to class but they just send out that email saying all the classes are online we're starting a week later so we're gonna start on April 6th as opposed to March 30th they're gonna find a way to get us our stuff I'm guessing they're gonna pack everybody's room up and ship them their stuff oh because I know they don't want everybody like swarming back to campus to get their stuff I don't know how they're gonna do it but they're gonna update us on that so I'll of course let y'all know I just want them to sue me my clothes my all my clothes out there my pillow my monitor like I have some important things that I left there but I know that they'll get it to me eventually so it's not really I know they have a lot of other things to worry about so that's not really like a priority but hopefully they'll figure out a way to get everybody their stuff since we're starting a week late we're gonna still have 10 weeks of instruction instead of 10 weeks plus a finals week so they said there's going to be no time for a finals week so basically we're not gonna have final exams in Spring Quarter we might have papers assignments whatever we're not gonna have final exams because the reasoning was that some students might not have a quiet place to take the exams so that really makes a lot of sense I'm glad they were like looking out for everybody also they are saying that commencement which is the graduation that they held every year is not going to be traditional so it may be like a virtual commencement or they might postpone it I'm not sure how that goes but that was just the update and now I'm about to get started with my youtube planning and my internship work I can talk a little bit about later when I start doing it okay so my camera just died I wonder if I'll be able to see like the difference in the quality you probably will but so now we about to get started on YouTube planning I kind of want to make like a day in the life of like a college youtuber and stuff cuz I do a lot of stuff for my youtube so firstly I mostly check my analytics on my recent videos so my most recent video was my online school tips and stuff so I'm just gonna check the analytics on that and then I'll get to planning out my next videos for the next week and checking my content calendar and updating like my spreadsheet of subscribers and stuff so that's what I'm about to do this is the dashboard that they show all the YouTube creators so here's my most recent video and they allow you to compare it to your other videos so as you can see this videos ranked fourth out of the last ten videos that I posted which means it's gotten it's like four thin views so as you can see my number one video was to online Stanford vlog then over here I can look at my top videos in the last 48 hours the summary of the last 28 days and my current subscribers so I've gotten 682 subscribers in the last month so thank you guys if you're new and you just subscribe to my channel thank you very much you've contributed to my channel growth and so I just checked my analytics on a daily basis I just check it randomly so just to see how like my channel is doing how my videos are performing and see which videos I'll actually like and respond to so now I'm gonna go to my content calendar and see which videos I want to do next plus my content calendar is kind of messed up now because I'm uploading more times a week so I kind of have to go in and input different dates but I can show you all that oh here's how I've set up my content calendar I have the title the date the status of the video and the subscriber count' when that video was posted so as you can see here is the video that I'm post and then I'm filming right now at show quarantine vlog plus a life update that's not the official name that's just like the idea of the video right now and that is set to post on March 21st 2020 which is a Saturday the videos plan because I planned this video out yesterday and then when I post it I will put the subscriber count right here and as you just saw from the time I posted this video on Wednesday I had five thousand forty nine subscribers and now I have five thousand one hundred ninety three subscribers so I've gained a few subscribers in that time period which lets me just monitor the growth of my channel on my own instead of just on the YouTube dashboard so I'm just gonna work on that for a little and I will talk to you guys in a second okay oh so it's like 3:45 right now 347 and as you can see I'm way ahead of schedule because I just finished all of this stuff that I wasn't supposed to start until 4:30 so as you can see this is all I have left on my to-do list so basically the rest of the day I can just chill because this is all like content creating that I can do while I'm like watching Netflix Hulu and just chilling okay so I've been getting a couple questions about the internship that I do so I am a digital marketing intern with this company called bullseye Admissions I promoted them on my channel a couple of videos ago so they sponsored my channel and I also have an internship with them they are in college advising service so you guys go check them out if you need help with college applications essays interviews anything and this video is not sponsored but I do work for them so if you want to follow our social media we are on tik-tok Twitter Instagram I'll be above that I can put them like right here so go check those out because I make the content for that basically I run the Twitter and tic-tock accounts and I also make content for the other accounts so right now I need to be making a social media campaign for our admitted students so that's what I'm gonna do and I'm just gonna watch Netflix while I edit some photos and do some stuff so that's basically what I'm about to do I'm way ahead of schedule so I can honestly just chill for the rest of the day I was very productive today okay so this is kind of like horrible quality but as you guys can see a this app called buffer to plan posts in advance so I've planned posts for the week okay you're not gonna be able to see it but anyway so it lets me connect my social media accounts and then I plan posts for the week so I have right now I have a post per day until Wednesday and I'll just going like retweet stuff but these are my planned tweets for the bullseye accounts so that's how I stay on top of like posting and stuff so I'm done with Twitter but I also have to do tick-tock stuff and I have to work on the social media campaign so I'm just gonna keep working on that and I'll check in with you guys as I finish as I check stuff off my to-do list okay yeah I'm a might say talk but now I have to go in and add the words but so I have to go through a net yeah I'm making it tick tockia so hard I never knew it was so hard and it takes me a while to go but I can add the words that make sure all the timing is right but I basically just do like little college tips and tricks and advice and just like clever videos using the the popular sounds on tik-tok I don't put my face as like the brand of the tic TOCs not like dancing or anything but I think they're pretty interesting especially if you're like a high school student about to go into this college application process we have really helpful tips on there so go follow us our username on there is bullseye dye admissions but like I said I'll have everything in like the description and up here so go follow us to see how my take sock turned out okay so I'm done with my tick-tock I'm about to walk my dog because the Sun is setting and I don't want it to get too dark this would be like my first time leaving the house today too so let me get out okay hey y'all so I got back from the walk and then I ate dinner with my family and now I'm in my bed changed into my pajamas very comfortable and I'm just gonna watch Netflix and just chill for a little no I'm so tired I don't want to go to bed but today's Friday and this video has to go up on Saturday my thing is so out of focus it's a lie still learning my way around the camera it's finally 9/16 and I'm just gonna spend the rest of the night editing this video I'm gonna edit on iMovie like I always edit and that's pretty much my vlog
