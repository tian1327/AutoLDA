 hello brothers and sisters in Christ and welcome back to my channel excuse my morning voice today I'm going to be vlogging about how I spend a day in quarantine I am a big routine person so not having anything to like set my day around is kind of annoying to me so what I have been doing is I've been making my own schedule I covered my external mic for some reason here it's really important to set intentions for your day I do that every day but they but especially one there's nothing to really dictate your schedule so the first thing that I do after waking up is I spend my time with Jesus that girl I I've kind of been struggling to connect with God's Word lately because I am kind of at a transition transitioning to living at home again and that's not good because it's it's really revealed to me that my quiet time was just becoming something that was routine it wasn't necessarily something that I desired to do so I've been getting back into that I'm in Matthew right now and I have a whole video my quiet time if you want to check that out I just got done with my quiet time and planning my next video I'm really excited about this one it's really challenged me I'm excited for it to challenge all of you guys as well on my schedule for 10 o'clock is my workout    so it's now 10:30 yeah I got a little distracted I am about to grind it out I think I'm gonna do some hit and then just do some walking I like doing hit because it makes me feel really powerful and I like walking because I can just like put on a movie or something I'm in the process of watching all the Marvel movies because I hadn't watched like any of them I'm on the Iron Man 2 right now so enjoy some of this embarrassing footage of me working out so it's a little afternoon now I took a shower and I just drank some iced coffee but I guess I just wanted to talk a little bit more about working out I really like to work out I think it's a great way for me to glorify God in the body that he's given me and just be able to take care of that gift something I have to constantly be checking my heart on though is that I'm that I am working out for those reasons to glorify God and not to glorify myself or to idolize my body in the way it looks because there's so many opportunities for us to do that now for us to just idolize our bodies and compare ourselves to other people the fake images we see on social media and things like that something that I've wrestled with a lot is making sure that I am working out for the right reasons it's kind of random but I thought that needed to be said so next up on my agenda is reading and I am reading the death of Christian plot by Michael LeMay it's really good I recommend it I think I'm gonna do a book review on this keep your eyes peeled for that it was a lot this book is really good but it like hurts my brain a little bit not gonna lie bless you bless you there is so much good stuff in here it's just like a lot so I have to kind of take it in small chunks I guess I've been reading for a little longer than I thought I've been reading for like 20 minutes yeah I'm gonna take a break and I'm gonna have to come back and reread everything I just read I think I'm gonna organize now about once a year I go through and I organize my closet and I organized my desk at my neck stands and I've already done my closet because I can move all my clothes back home from college but now I think it's time to do some other stuff so we're going to shop sorry okay name Jana I'm Alexis sister the best youtuber basically a pro at this   I so it's been a little while since I've checked in with you guys where did the day go I haven't done the greatest job of sticking with my agenda but that's okay I guess I just been to have a little heart-to-heart with you guys about this whole corona virus quarantine thing it's been hard so far for me because I haven't seen any my friends not only my friends from college but also my friends from home because I can't see anybody in person right now and that's kind of tough but honestly the hardest part about it for me is staying off the news and social media and stuff because I just want to know what's going on but there comes a point when you are as informed as you can be so just like scrolling through endless news articles about the corona virus isn't gonna be helping you it's just gonna make you worry more and steal your joy because we can't know everything we weren't designed to know everything we were designed to trust that God's got it all handled and I know that but sometimes it's hard for me to believe that and actually like apply it to this situation that's happening so if you find yourself feeling that way you are not alone I feel that way too so I'm just trying to make the best of it there was one more thing on my agenda that I need to accomplish and that was to practice so I'm gonna do that now that usually takes me around two hours if you're new here I am a first year music education and oboe performance major in college and even though I'm not in class right now I can't let my skills wane so I practice so we're we're doing a lot of cleaning out of house cleaning so this is fun all this Wow we found the pixels and I made this wonderful design so I had a little bit of lingering homework that I have to do yeah so that's fun to do on a Saturday night okay yeah it's raw to eat supper we're having a lot of fun here and Quarantine subscribed to things I thought I was gonna do some coloring now I think instead I'm gonna work on next week's video I hope to drop more than one video this week cuz I have so much time on my hands I'm so sorry I feel like my day was so boring I hope you guys found this entertaining coming at you from my normal filming spot my bed I'm kind of tired so I'm gonna go to sleep during this time of social distancing and staying in place and all those kind of things make sure that you're setting intentions for yourself for your day today kind of got away from me like I see even said intentions and today I went really fast and I didn't necessarily accomplish everything I intended to do and that's okay that I didn't get everything that I wanted to get to because I did some things that were far better like spending some time with my family and those are the kind of things that you just can't put in an agenda I hope that you liked this video and that it inspired you to set some self quarantine intentions for yourself and I also hope that you are spending your time in self quarantine intentionally that you're spending some time with the Lord you're spending some time really taking care of yourself and self examining this is a really great time to just kind of reflect the song of the week this week is ever be by Anthony Evans it's kind of like a remix see you guys soon but until then thank you so much for watching and remember to always choose joy
