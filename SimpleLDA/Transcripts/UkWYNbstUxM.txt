 hey guys welcome back to my channel I just filmed a little clip with some of my thoughts but what's going on right now but I think I'm going to use that clip and maybe a series of other clips and kind of its own separate video about how I'm feeling about everything that's going on right now with the whole entire world but I think I'm going to make some separate videos just basically like what it's like being quarantined because of a pandemic virus which I never thought I would ever say those words and I still can't believe that like the world is at the current state that it's at I literally am in like shop and I can't even wrap my head around what's going on but I am I mentioned this in the other clip but I am officially out of work indefinitely and unlike a lot of people that are salaried I am NOT so I am NOT going to be working and therefore I'm not getting paid so that's a little bit weird to not know when you're going to be getting any income I mean obviously I'm married so I have that going for me but it's just weird to like not have any income and then also be not know when the next time you're going to work is like my whole entire life is just like I'm being dramatic my whole entire life but you know the next couple weeks or however long it's just kind of like out there in front of me and I don't know what they're going to include like am I going to be going to work in a couple of days or in a couple weeks am I gonna eventually be like quarantined to my literal house so anyway it's a weird time but I thought I would really want like to document this little weird very unique bizarre circumstance that my life is right now and everyone's life is is affecting everybody in some way and it's just kind of vlog daily of what I have going on so I've been up for a while it's actually just about lunchtime we're about to eat lunch but this morning I got up and had some coffee and just you know updated my planner cuz it is Monday so it's like the first day of the week I made Ken breakfast I actually edited and uploaded a video which I had like on my to-do list I wanted to get that video edited and uploaded so that's already ready to go I just sort of shower so I'm in just like comfy clothes right now it's kind of cold still and I'm actually working on just finishing up some laundry so I've gotten quite a few things done oh and I also unpacked I just got back from my Hilton and bachelorette weekend with him on to my girlfriend's so I've been pretty productive I'm kind of organizing and getting this room together I took a shower so I'm getting stuff done and it's just weird because I feel like the next however many days or weeks is just gonna be filled with a lot of free time which I usually don't have very much of so in a sense I'm looking forward to it you know just staying positive about the circumstances that I can't change but also too much free time can be maybe a little bit overwhelming I've never actually experienced what it's like to have too much free time so I might be fine because I have tons of books I want to read my watch later list on YouTube has 522 video designs so I can definitely watch a ton of YouTube there's definitely a ton of like organizing and cleaning that I would love to do and switching out our clothes for the seasons and things like that so I definitely think I will stay busy so anyway I thought I would just kind of start this video up and I'll bring you guys along for however much longer I am I don't know on like coronavirus quarantine okay so next I'm making stock Ken's over here working but I'm gonna make a big huge thing of stock my mom actually gave me like this massive stock pot which I've been wanting for so long and what I'm doing is actually saw this on this Instagram account I follow but it's basically like the best idea ever and I'm literally so sad that I didn't realize it or learn about it sooner because I could have made this like a bajillion times in my life by now but you basically just keep all of your like a veggie scraps and if you want it if you're like not vegetarian and you like bones and just keep all the veggie scraps and bones traps in here in a big giant Ziploc bag and as you can tell it's like all pretty much frozen because I just leave this in the freezer until you fill the bag totally up and like this can barely close anymore so I have to make this like now I can't add to it any further but you just keep filling up a bag slowly with like all your scraps until you get the bag totally full and then you just throw it in a stockpot with ten cups of water and like salt and pepper and let it boil for probably six hours I think and it's just gonna make like a massive batch of so much delicious broth I'm so excited to try this I love homemade broth but I don't end up really having it a lot because it's kind of rare that I have enough like either bones or scraps that veggies like make broth which is why this is the best idea Plus is really good for eliminating waste I really don't like wasting like anything like literally even like the ends of a zucchini I like I hate throwing it away because it's just wasteful so this is a really good way to not waste anything you can get literally use out of every single scrap of everything you cook and homemade broth is just like the most delicious thing ever I love like using in soups and like boiling stuff in it it's so flavorful and this is gonna make a ton of it so I'm doing this for the first time but I'm super excited it's obviously super simple but I really wanted to share it because I think it's a really good hack so I'll show you guys how I do it there's a good ton of stuff in there and of course you can add more to it you can like throw like whole garlic or whole onions or carrots or anything you want to like flavor it up and while that works I'm just like making I haven't even eaten yet today but I'm not crazy hungry so I'm just making a little salad I want to throw some sweet potato on top of it I can actually throw these little ends in here and I'm just gonna have like a little spinach arugula sweet potato salad alright get this going so I figured while I'm here in the kitchen I will work on dinner so I'm making like stuffed like zucchini and squash and I'm gonna be using on me like a ton of pulp or so I think I'm just going to stuff it with some of the leftover whole pork so I feel like that'll be really good and like fairly healthy right     computer   so I'm actually cooking is yet I'm just putting them in here because I'm gonna bake them in a little while but these are how the little zucchini boats came out they're like I literally meet just the perfect amount so I have the insides of the zucchini plus pulled pork and then I put some like salsa at the bottom of them does this it keep them moist and then a little mozzarella on top and then these will baked up it'll get all melty this is like super healthy but I think it's gonna be really yummy time to check some stuff off my to-do list which is like my favorite thing ever Wow it's like two o'clock I've already crossed off one two three four five things it's pretty good honestly and I ain't stop it now all right so I'm so tired I think I would have take it out but I just finished editing and uploading you did the thumbnail everything for a second video of the day so I'm kind of on a roll getting videos done I actually just got some communication from my job about how they're gonna be like paying us and like what the expectations of this continuity pay program will be so I mean I'm kind of surprised I got that communication out to us so quickly cuz I didn't think that they had like anything really discussed so it sounds like they kind of like hopped on that so at least they're getting it together and we're gonna be compensated in some form over these next however long so I'm very happy to hear about that I think they really like they were efficient with all that kind of communication so that's good so I have my video uploading here I'm working on the stop it's house smells so good because the smell of the stock is just like weeping everywhere it smells so good I'm going to a cycle class I think Ken's gonna come to the gym with me to in like two hours from now so I think I might just close my eyes or like just lay down maybe just like take a little half hour nap something small just because I don't feel like I'm fully recovered from my like girls trip weekend I slept like four to five hours a week for like the entire weekend for three nights so I'm a little bit behind on sleep anyway and I think that's why I'm so tired so I might nap but let me show you this broth situation it is looking and smelling so freaking good Wow all right well excuse all the junk here we're about to go to the gym together he only has cords on his headphones cuz it's kind of like a vintage vibes and it's kind of like retro not because yeah not because he's out of touch with hold it down by little guru out to the gym I thank you not coming I don't think I'm gonna bring my camera maybe a wolf at my camera in my bag I probably have to run to Walmart so maybe  okay so that was a really really a really good workout I've learned like 750 calories in like less than an hour so that was really good I should probably stop going to the gym though I know I'm like my aunt and my mom were all messaging me when they saw it was at the gym and were like stop going and I know but I probably should stop going I think they're honestly gonna close it or at least they're gonna probably cancel classes and probably cancel the whole gym to like close it but there were only like six people in the class and we're in like a confined little space and we're only using a bike so I like Lysol the bike really good we were all like at least 10 to 12 feet apart and there was only a couple of us so I feel like it was fine but then again I know that you know social distancing and we shouldn't be voluntarily going to things like that so anyway speaking of that I'm at Walmart now which is probably gonna be a complete mess like you know everyone is freaking out about everything and stocking up on everything so but I just don't have any more like salad mix so I literally just need like arugula and that's pretty much it so I really don't like feel like I need anything crazy that other people are gonna be like scrounging for hopefully so we will see but I'm gonna run in here I think this might be kind of interesting to document and like the shelves are stripped it's just bananas so so it literally just filled my clip and just parked and realize that ken drove to the gym like he's still at the gym I just wanted to run in here really quick so since he drove I didn't bring my wallet and my keys so I don't have my wallet or my keys therefore I don't have credit card or anything to pay for my groceries with I have Apple pay on my phone but I don't know if Lamar takes that while my face is so red maybe Ken can send me a picture of his credit card oops okay never mind he leaves his wallet in the car when he's at the gym I didn't know that so I have literally like some of these frozen food things with about a little empty like there's just nothing here look it's completely empty everything just empty empty and over here MD and mg empty this is wild you see this literally not even a one thing  that's pretty funny I mean it's not funny but it's like kind of comical but this is what's happening okay this has to be like the craziest part there's not a single meat product oh wait there's this random bacon and a couple of packs of Meatballs oh my gosh that's insane alright the bikini bikini boats zucchini both bikini but what probably nice right about now are done why do you think you need one more bite to be able to tell okay also look at these beautiful flowers can't got me yesterday I already showed on the blog but he got this for me as soon as he picked me up for my trip he came out of the car with them and that was so sweet hmm thank you honey so you hate it um it's good wish it was a zucchini well it's so it's good regardless the other ingredients are good you don't like the zucchini part be honest yeah I don't like the zucchini part because I wish it wasn't so keenya which it was anything else mmm mmm all right how about time for bed kids like watching me what that boys is but that is the end of I don't wanna see quarantine day one because we're not like technically quarantine but because I don't work right now it kind of feels that way so that is the end of day 1 see what tomorrow brings
