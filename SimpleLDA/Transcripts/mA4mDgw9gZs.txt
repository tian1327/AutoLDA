 hey everyone welcome back to my channel so this week is a very special week we are under a social quarantine it's actually the start of week number three it's Monday March 30th and it is a new week of social isolation I want to show you guys what it's like what I've been doing to stay busy and taking you around New York City while it's completely empty of course being socially isolated I'll take you along with me when I go grocery shopping and when I go on walks all non-essential businesses are closed and leaving only grocery stores liquor stores and pharmacies open of course you can still go outside for exercise taking walks just making sure that you're away from other people at least six feet obviously lately it's been like really ugly and raining so the next nice day I'll definitely take you guys outside so great to get some vitamin D as well and also later this week I'm gonna have to go grocery shopping cuz I'm almost out of food I definitely have been staying a busy inside I've been doing a lot more working out cooking a ton reading a ton watching TV also like creating videos like this always works from home so it's not too much of a difference for me it's just a lot of emails are kind of dead and right now it's not really much going on in terms of emails but definitely creating content is still on so so hope you guys enjoy the week really quiet are you here are the parades and recycling this Monday the streets are really empty looks like just so low people walking around I guess I have a package I hate walking down these steps but it's my first time walking down these steps in like two days  this one's for me oh my god it's heavy is there anything better than getting in a care package during the party you know I don't think so sir my mom and dad so I'm gonna open it up and see what's inside it's like the highlight of my quarantine this bonds is spaghetti this actually is made from chickpeas it's so good less carbs there is then this regular pasta oh my god vitamins we are totally set with all these snacks and lotion and vitamins I'm so excited for all that I also received this package from the fold London and I received the amazing white like work pants they also sent a white blazer it's super nice so this is what the suit looks like on super cute it's a high-waisted trouser and this really cute suit jacket really really nice quality this is from the fold London this is super cute can't wait to wear this it's like a meeting or something once the world goes back in order but yeah loving this suit super cute so I've been home just watching youtube videos looking up places that I really want to go to so kind of doing some summer travel planning hopefully it all goes through but I'm actually going to order some takeout from my favorite restaurant in the East Village they're finally open for takeout they were actually unavailable for two weeks and finally open so at 7 o'clock everyone is clapping for all the people who are working this truth seems a little dull  no so we ordered some Korean popcorn chicken this lobster mac and cheese which is new noodle that is a brand new item for the menu as well and they added in these amazing soju drinks that get me so strong I don't know what it is with this Korean soju but it's so good anyway we are about to be was a super chill day I did a little bit of a workout and then I had lunch facetimed with else nao lunchtime facetiming without say hi here's some proof that I did spend some time working on the computer good morning today looks like a beautiful sunny day I have my coffee today looks like a beautiful day for a walk so today we have finally a nice weather day the past four days have been like rainy cold and just super depressing actually so it's a finally sunny here so I'm definitely going to take advantage of the weather get some vitamin D and just get some fresh air so I'm gonna go on a little bike ride probably go down to Battery Park and then bike back of course I'm gonna sanitize the bike I think it's super important to get vitamin D so I do take advantage of just getting some little exercise in and taking in the Sun to go get on the bike  made an afternoon snack of some shishito peppers actually it's almost dinnertime but looks pretty delicious I've been cooking a lot of neat things lately let's see how this tastes absolutely I will be making these organics I'm really good I've never made them before and they're so easy I just added olive oil and it cooked on one so top for like five minutes because they are making these weird popping noises oh yeah these are really delicious so we're digging in this is how I'd like to start my morning little coffee with almond milk No oh my bird yeah today is not a nice day and today is a grocery day I haven't been to the grocery store in over a week so I'm definitely overdue what's left in my fridge is literally two eggs butter and some cauliflower so definitely want something more to eat than that so I will be headed off to Trader Joe's you do at the waited line but once you're inside though it's super quiet my hair also looks so much longer than usual like it's just like grew overnight  so the last time I went I went right when they opened and I had to wait in line for an hour so I'm very curious see how busy it is now because it's raining and it's afternoon so hopefully it's not our wait so last time I had to wait all the way back over here so it looks like there's hardly line this is great news  so the weight actually took about an hour they were letting in senior citizens first and then but we were not moving for like ever but the store itself which is great and I'm just going to get immunity for the that experience was so exhausting that you don't even want to go more than once a week just because you have to wait in line for like a good true hour just waiting in line so tell me why that I spent the most amount of money on this chair Joe's trip I spent $96 how is that even possible like what did I buy my almond milk is pretty expensive but I honestly nothing is under $5 I don't thinks is the correct path I guess it is so obviously I like a lot of salads need some tissues for my room eggs I'll do that without some cheese on there sausage lots of lemons and limes onion my favorite potato chips some tomatoes cooking spray broccoli chocolate celery zucchini the almond milk that I've been buying lately it's literally just almonds and water so super organic today is a much sunny writer day and it's so funny on the weather app on our phones it says that it's gonna be cloudy all day but in reality it's like a full Sun so I think we want to trick us about staying inside but thankfully I live in an apartment with a fire escape so I'm gonna go out there right now and it's just so awesome to have New York style outdoor space because I don't have a terrace or backyard like none of us do here in New York so so it's really cool that my mom made this customized pad so I can have a nice space custom measurements thanks mom coming out here is always a little sticky so this oh my god my knee just cracked the view here is really cool so I come out my fire escape probably every day that it's nice out especially in summertime I've read books out here I would love to have like a table or something so any other configurations we're not even supposed to have like flower powers because there were a fire we would have to run down these steps so I've brought out the element I'm just like my fire escape honestly it's like it's like a bar you know it's like happy hour right now it's like 4:00 p.m. you know enjoying the situation that we're in where my favorite dishes I had a ton in southern Italy it's a zucchini pasta zucchini cheese and your pasta noodles spaghetti noodles and I'll show you guys how I make it so we cut up the zucchini into like very very thin slices for just doing sauce with garlic and then we shredded some pecorino romano cheese  this is the final dish it looks so delicious a super easy pasta to make it's just the cheese that makes it so gooey so I'm going to dig in so at seven o'clock every night we have some bells ringing         thank you so much for watching this weekly blog who guys thought it interesting and I will keep you updated on what I'm doing on my Instagram so you gonna check me out it's at dnumber Eze and i'll see you guys in my next video
