until like april 30th as of now so hopefully you guys are still staying safe staying clean and hopefully you know you guys are still following your fitness goals but yeah guys i know it's hard right now for everybody um to like uh stay motivated and stick to your plans that you made from the beginning of the year you know for your health your wealth all that um especially your fitness goals man it's been really hard on us people like basically you know on us and um yeah man i totally understand you guys um but you got you you guys just basically have to make work for what you guys have and yeah like not all of us have um you know access to gyms you know like not all of us have access to dumbbells you know to the equipment that we need you know to maintain the gains basically so yeah guys basically like during this quarantine thing um my whole goal right now is to just maintain basically the physique that i have or you know try to because you can't really gain anything right now especially you know with the lack of equipment with the lack of you know basically resources right now since basically everything is closed except for essential stuff so yeah and can't really train the way that i used to train you know before this lockdown so yeah guys i've been using beautiful days like today right now it's saturday i'm off the weekend been working all week um basically that's what i've been up to guys i've just been working um at my job so yeah i'm an essential worker so yeah guys um i've just been working since i can't really do anything else um you know outside of work except for you know just stay at home and play warzone and yeah all that stuff man and that kind of gets you real hard and boring so then you start thinking like damn bro i should have just been working like don't get me up at home i'll still be making my beats i'll still you know try to be um be productive make my music um try to make some content for you guys on youtube but yeah um so i took this weekend off anyways you know i'm gonna be off tomorrow anyways and like you know everybody at my job gonna be off tomorrow for easter because it's a holiday and also today i'm off so i would i would have you know came into work today but you know i need a day off i need to get my mind straight um and take advantage of days like this where the weather is nice because you know i live in chicago it's usually cold as and windy as hell so it's been like that for like the past like a couple days now um it was random as  like earlier this week it was like 70 degrees and warm for like two days and now it's cold and it was actually snowing a couple days too so that was kind of that kind of caught me off guard yeah you guys right now it is currently let me just pull the weather out for you guys um it's 11 a.m right now and in chicago right now it's currently 55 degrees as you guys can see right there and it's probably gonna rain like around five at night today so that's why i'm trying to take advantage of right now of the weather before it gets too cold or you know before it starts raining and all that and basically like today is the only day that i'll probably be able to run again until like next week um where you know i get off of my work or you know where i'm off so yeah so after today i'm gonna have like a three day break maybe four from like doing workouts i've been working out for like the past like four days now um so it's pretty good um four days out of the whole week so today i think i think today's gonna be the fourth day or might be the fifth i don't know but yeah um i'm gonna go and stretch and basically get my mouth run and probably do two miles because that's what i've been trying to do um i've been always doing 2.5 miles you know almost 3 miles in the gym but yeah it's kind of hard when you're outside because you factor in the weather and the terrain and all that but um the place where i run right now it's it's in my school um my old high school so i there's like a field over there for turf is and then like basically like the whole track is like like it's like her and that's rainbow like um it's just cement you know just like a little path like little circle um so yeah i i told you guys about this in the last in the last vlog you know six laps equals one mile i believe according to them and you know back when i was running and also you know from my uh apple watch it tells me to so yeah it's about six say um six laps equals one mile so yeah um i'm gonna try to do at least you know 12 laps you know around jogging running whatever  but i just want to get my 2.5 miles in for today and yeah so i'm gonna go ahead and get started and yeah let's go all right you guys so basically now i'm here in my field at uh my old high school still the old um stomping grounds right here guys so you guys can see but yeah man this was where i was at um the last time with foiling so from that last video that you for that i posted you guys saw that um so yeah is that i'm slow key so there's not really that much people and right now i'm about myself right now so which is a good thing so i got this whole place to myself so yeah um i'm gonna go get this uh stretching in so i'm gonna go switch to my running shoes um yeah and then start stretching and then start doing some cardio and yeah let's go   so    all right you guys so i

my activity app hopefully this focuses man but as you guys can see april 11 outdoor run 25 minute session uh 2.5 miles burned about 308 calories but yeah man pretty good run today for an outdoor run i'll take it man as long as i do my 25 minute session and try to do 2.5 miles or better around that area i'm happy with it happy with the results man my camera is flashing red right now um hopefully this doesn't die on me if not then i'm probably gonna have to start filming on my iphone but yeah i'm gonna go start training right now uh do the um upper body workouts that i showed you guys bodyweight workouts so yeah i start doing that but first gotta get my after cardio stretching and yeah let's go  so  so   so  so  so    all right y'all so as you guys can see i'm currently vlogging on my iphone right now um my camera died earlier so rip i forgot to charge it last night i don't know i was going to vlog today but it's all good though all right i need to i need to get on track and charge my man but yeah man um right now just wrapped up doing uh body weight exercises basically the same exercises that i showed you guys from the last video so yeah um if you guys want more in-depth um you know how to do it pretty simple straightforward um i explain it like what the name of the ex of the exercises are um so yeah if you want check out the last video um so right now thankfully i have a 15 pound dumbbell right here um i i like i already knew i had dumbbells in my house i just didn't know where they were but i only found one and it was a 15 pound one so i found that a couple days ago and i've been using it ever since so it really kind of saved me um you know from my mission to like maintain um especially since like you know everywhere it's sold out and right now like online prices if you're trying to buy them on ebay or amazon they're basically raping you for some dumbbells man like a 15 pound like this for brand new could be like they're going for like 80 dollars man 80 80 you know almost 200 per dumbbell which is insane so whoever like if you guys are out there trying to finesse people um go yourself but yeah man um so yeah um blessed to have these dumbbells gonna put it to good use and yeah so i'm gonna start trading so i'm probably gonna do a little bit of everything today probably will start with um legs first um i kind of want to get i kind of want to do legs again um i've done legs like i think that was like back in tuesday this week so it was a couple days ago back when the weather was still good too so i want to hit it again um so yeah i'm going to start off with some lunges then after that probably do some squats and yeah i'll show you guys my routine for quarantine leg days let's go whoa i've been thinking about you thinking how we even got to this place i always feel i need you girl tell me how you feel baby come my way i've been on my grind now my daddy always told me money's all used to chase so i'm using all my time now securing all the bags that advantage without the trace hey before the money i was so in love with you i was so in love with you i would do this all for you i was running making plans out for me and for you then you switched up on me and told me that's why and yeah i know it's hard been going through some things in which i know we can get over those but but i need you yeah you you make me feel complete when i'm with you it feels like we're the only ones i'm a young ass making all this money all the people that love me they're looking at me kind of funny all the i with and i wish they ain't dump me now i'm looking all right y'all so basically done with like warming up the legs uh doing some warm-up squats lunges and all that um so basically you start off with four rounds of lunges there and back four rounds of that it's all about the squeeze and the hold when you go down so yeah keep an eye on that uh when you're doing them and also do 10 squats uh 10 squats of three sets so 10 reps each set um as i showed you guys earlier so yeah now i'm trying to go use the dumbbells and i'm gonna try to do i'm gonna go do some uh squats with that so yeah i'll show you guys how that looks like damn like who the biggest dummy clearly that ain't me i got on from overseas yeah the finest brawls in the cars you won't believe yeah you won't find another  who got it like me yeah how many you know like this i got a bad and she priceless all my watches i start any timeless my heart is so cold like my eyes so yeah guys that pretty much wraps up the legs so it's just mainly squats and lunges so yeah you guys can do this anywhere outside inside doesn't matter you need a little bit of space and if you have dumbbells use those dumbbells like i only have a 15 pounder so 15 pounds is good enough so yeah um so basically just take everything to your advantage and yeah just use your creativity because right now all i can really do is just maintain maintain the gains that we had yeah all right y'all so right now um i'm gonna work on some triceps and biceps so i'll show you guys what i'm gonna do with that so yeah i'm gonna show you  complete guys i'm with you it feels like we're the only ones in that one world yeah i can't believe you made me do this you turned me to a savage yeah with the music you could have been with me if you wasn't ruthless now my paper up and all i do is make the music imagine if you stayed through the crisis through the long days of the night yeah i've been too busy making money with the music i can't even put myself  how many do you know did it like that make the music and pop off  you make me feel complete when i'm with  in which i know we can get over those belfast but i need you yeah you you make me feel complete when i'm with you it feels like we're the only ones in our own world  all right y'all so basically that is pretty much it for the circuit that i do for um arms it works on your triceps your biceps and yeah that's what i do for basically biceps contractions let's take it right now man oh it's been a while it's been a long workout um but yeah uh right now i am going to finish up my sets i'm gonna do three more rounds of the same thing
