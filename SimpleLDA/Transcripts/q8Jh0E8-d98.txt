  hello everyone it's issa and welcome back to my channel if you have been watching my videos for a while now you probably recognize this area that i'm filming in i am back in new york city um i got back yesterday morning um i don't really feel like i should justify why i'm here but i am um my apartment has been sitting here for like three months now untouched and i didn't leave it here to be left here for that long um so actually when i got here it was pretty gross like i'll give you some details it was too dead nice disgusting a lot of mice droppings everywhere it was really gross my ac wasn't working um a lot of dust everywhere obviously that's normal but i just really felt like i needed to like see what was going on here i left a lot of stuff here and i just didn't feel comfortable leaving it that much longer here without me checking up on it so i'll probably be here for like a month um obviously i was very careful on the plane i'm careful here always wear a mask washing my hands and everything but yeah so i kind of spent the day yesterday cleaning yeah i thought i would just vlog a little bit i'm very very happy to be back um my friend was in new york for the day because he um he had to pack up his dorm room that he left here like when we left school and um so he came and picked up his stuff and he dropped this off for me a little it looks kind of weird it's a little like incense cone or something a bottle sample and it smells so good i've been lighting it on and off all day so i'm going to light it up right now um but yeah all i've done so far is clean it just smells so good i love lighting this like after i clean my apartment so yummy so it kind of just burns out a little bit i kind of move it from room to room and it smells really good but yeah i have a flower right here so pretty um and i also have these flowers here i love just having like some nice flowers out i've been that was like my goal when i got back was to like have pretty flowers i have these two and my plant actually was a lot of it was dead there was a few pieces but i watered it and it's coming back to life really nicely i'm just leaving it in the sun um this one i might have to remove but yeah little updates um i have not unpacked completely yet um and if you can hear my air conditioning um i'm not gonna turn it off because it's really hot when i do and it wasn't working for a while i have to unpack still i literally just have my suitcase sitting here does this happen to anyone else every time i check a bag lately like um the tsa have been looking through it which i know it like it's their right whatever but it's really weird you just never happened to me but now it's been happening to me every time i travel i don't know but i had ordered some hand soap for when i got back and i just got it smells so good it's from the parachute and oc osea oc collection and it smells really good and i got the matching hand cream because i've been washing my hands not stop non-stop obviously especially being here and my hands get dry so yeah i don't know i don't know what else to say i'm just so happy to be here like actually ecstatic no it smells so good but yeah i'm literally just walking around right now i'm so happy i need to unpack i'm also going to be selling more stuff on my depop here i have a lot of clothes here that i just don't wear anymore but they're super super cute i have like cuter things in new york i think but yeah i want to sell a lot of things and organize my drawers and i'm not even going to show you they are so disorganized it's appalling but i thought i would share i'm gonna move the palo santo to the kitchen i'm so happy like i'm so happy to be here i just feel like so good when i'm in new york and i don't know but i don't really know what to do right now i had a coffee earlier i made some eggs and toast because my avocados aren't ripe yet but yeah it's going to be a chill vlog i guess there's not really much to do obviously in new york right now everything's still closed as it should be but today the governor announced that new york city will be open on june 8th which is very exciting obviously like restaurants and stuff don't open yet but it's in the process of happening which is very exciting um yeah i don't know what else to say i'll let you guys know i guess when i do something else fun i might go for a walk later explore it's so hot in new york already last week i was checking the temperature here and it was like the 60s and 70s and i think it's like 80 something right now so i'm really sad i missed like the good spring chilly-ish new york weather but i'm still happy to be back anyway  i just got back from my walk and it was so nice outside it's like sunny and a little bit breezy but hot it's really really lovely and it was really nice to walk exploring seeing what's going on right now i went to the health food store and picked up a few things that they didn't have at whole foods and i did my um prime order and i already wiped everything down so i'll just show you guys what i got it's really small and simple so they actually had my favorite bread so i picked up some of the bread they have this chocolate is so good this is my favorite flavor and this is the only one they had which was amazing i got some red sauerkraut i love sauerkraut on salads i got some tofu i have been loving tofu lately in the airfryer like cubing it up and throwing it in there for like 15 minutes and it gets nice and crispy on the outside and then the last thing i got is just some tuna some tuna um i don't know i've been really liking tuna lately um and i just like put it in salads chickpeas and like i'll do a greek style salad with some tuna yeah so i'm gonna put that away i wore a hat because um it's really sunny outside and i figured like i'm wearing a mask so that covers this part of my face and then this part like my forehead would be getting so much done so i just put a hat on i want to get like a weird tan line on my face but yeah i'm gonna put all this away good morning it's the next day now and it's a beautiful day so beautiful i think it's in the 60s right now so i want to go for a walk um yeah it's just so pretty i will show you guys what i'm wearing it's just really simple chill but yeah it's just so pretty outside and so sunny maybe i can find somewhere to get a coffee okay so i'm wearing this crew neck from auritzia i love ritzy crewnecks i think this is a size this is a size one but i've been getting size twos and for some reason this one seems more oversized than a normal size one but i really like it and then i'm wearing these biker shorts also from ritzia these are the five inch they're pretty old though so i don't know if they still have this color and then i'm wearing this free people tank i love those tanks i'll link everything down below if i can find it and then i'm wearing these yeezys these are one of the newer collections they released like right before quarantine happened but yeah i'm obsessed with that i love like the orange detailing because i always wear like neutral colors so like the orange gives it a little pop and yeah so that's what i'm wearing today and for my little walk um yeah on the agenda today i have to work out i have to clean out my bathroom i have so many products that i don't really use anymore that are expired that i just want to clean out and then i have to actually i came to new york one of the reasons that i came here and i didn't say it before is that i kind of wanted like a space that was quiet so i could study for the lsat i'm i think i'm gonna take the lsat possibly um and possibly go to law school not really sure what's gonna happen there but that's like something that i've been considering so i want to have like a place to study for the lsat that's quiet without a lot of distractions so i can like really focus because it's really hard for me to focus on things like that sometimes there's like a lot of other things that i could be doing in people i could be hanging out with so yeah i'm going to do that today and make a schedule of like all the different times that i want to study throughout the week and like what i want to do when all that kind of stuff i don't know i'm going to go for my walk now i put my sunscreen on and i'm gonna have my mask and we're just gonna go for a little stroll see what's going on feel the nice breeze so yeah i didn't end up getting coffee but i picked up a bagel from the bagel place near me and it's a whole everything bagel scooped out and toasted with tofu scallion cream cheese tomato onion and lettuce and this is my order always and whenever i get a bagel this is what i get and i always get it from the same place because it's super close to me so i'm not gonna say what it is but d wish okay so i'm in my bathroom now and i'm gonna clean out my cabinets so this is like one of what my cabinets look like it's kind of a mess and also a lot of these things i've had since i moved in here and i moved in here like this is my third gonna be my third year living here so it's just like stuff that's probably expired so i'm just gonna get rid of a few things organize this and you guys will see what it looks like when it's done okay wow i got rid of so much stuff so much of it was expired i was like looking back to figure out when i got them and a lot of it was like over a year ago so and a lot of it i don't really use so i'll show you guys my organization method so this is like stuff that i use every day so this is my cleanser that i use every morning and every night i'm getting the full size soon but this is just a little one then i have my niacinamide serum my dermatologist um treatment it's called veltin that's what i use three times a week for my skin hyaluronic acid my current moisturizers that i like this one is one that i've been using every single day and then sunscreen is very important obviously and then here i have a spot treatment extra moisturizer and eye cream some oils these are like lip serums and then in here i kind of keep like facial razors spoolie my eyelash serum and then on this one i keep all of my masks and treatments so i have these masks here this one and this one are my two all-time favorite masks and then i have my like a treatment that i use sometimes like an exfoliating one and then this is really really great if your skin is really dry and then up here i just have a body cream that i barely use and then my drunk elephant um cleansing balm that i use usually every day but sometimes i just don't but yeah and that is that it's a very organized very minimized not cluttered i'm very happy about that   so i just made some lunch if you watched my last video this is the same exact recipe that i did in my last video it's just lettuce tomato cucumber red onion a little bit of olive oil and vinegar because i don't have like another dressing to use some sauerkraut hilary's black rice veggie burger in the violife feta which is so so so good and yeah that's everything it's so delicious is the best salad ever i highly recommend it i just put on my diffuser it's from vitruvi and i used grapefruit and lemon because i just want to have a little bit of like a fresh scent in the apartment like an invigorating snack so i'm kind of tired i just picked up some sugar fish oh yeah so i got the toro cut roll and the crab cut roll i love sugar fish i love sushi i feel like sushi is like the best healthiest food to get for takeout because it's just fresh fish rice and seaweed and all those things are very healthy so um they give you this little thing for the soy sauce but i actually i'm gonna use coconut aminos not only because it's healthier i just like the flavor of it better than soy sauce i think and yeah it's just so delish you
