 it's 249 p.m. and I've been working all day but at the same time it's one of those days where it feels like I haven't gotten anything done I've just been on the phone posting videos talking about a secret company a and then secret company B if you didn't know there's there's kind of two secret companies going on one will be very soon you guys will know what it what it is the other you might not ever know what it is it's kind of a secret secret company but you know what makes me feel like I've accomplished something in a day making a vlog so that's what we're gonna do now but first uh I have to clean up so what why is there why is the red bull in the middle  this just is not my day I got into like a minute of cleaning and then something shorted in here and half my plugs turned off Internet's off Red Bull fridge is off so I hate dealing with this stuff but uh okay the office is looking much cleaner much better to be fair I did mostly just move around things so it looks more tidy alright we're gonna have to just rely on window window lighting here because the power isn't on still but that's okay yesterday I did a review on the new Sony zv1 which is a camera made for vloggers youtubers but like we saw I feel like it kind of fails that that mostly just because it's it's too cropped in it's too zoomed in and it's just kind of a floating head in different places and 24 mil is as the white as it goes which is it it's like right on the cusp of being wide enough but then with the active image stabilization it crops in a little bit more it just feels a little bit too zoomed in for me but all last night and today I've been thinking about what are the actual best vlogging cameras right now like if my friend was like I want to start vlogging once to our YouTube channel what camera and good conscience recommend a hundred percent to what are the best vlogging cameras in 2020 that's what I'm gonna try to answer it but first we need to look out what do we actually need in a vlogging camera because there's a lot of things that would be nice to have or we want but we don't actually necessarily need and to me what you need is an easy enough camera to use but still with a high quality image a flip LCD screen would be really really nice it's almost a must for me but you could get away with not having it we need a good wide-angle frame because a lot of times you're just holding it in your hand and you don't want it to be just a floating head in different places good autofocus is a must and lastly you need good audio everything else like high frame rates and that kind of stuff is just kind of extra so first off let's say you have little to no budget and you want like the easiest camera possible you don't know anything about filmmaking you just want it to be super convenient and easy well you don't need one of these instead what you do is you reach into your pocket and you grab your smartphone when I posted the cb1 review someone commented the quality coming out looks like a phone camera and that's the truth all of the smaller sensor cameras that I've tried there they kind of just look like smart phone footage except a lot harder to use and it's another piece of gear that you need to be carrying around and in some cases the smart phone just looks better because of all the software advancements they've made like adding dynamic range and the crazy stabilization they have in things like the iPhone nowadays almost every vlog that I've made during quarantine which is I think like 40 vlogs I've basically been like daily vlogging during the week almost every single video I'd say at least 80 to 90 percent includes some iPhone footage and I bet a lot of people don't even realize and so often when I post on on Instagram stories I'm just using my iPhone 11 Pro and almost every time somebody's asking like what camera are using what does it look that can't be just your phone like what are you doing to it this is an incredible tool and there's not one smaller camera cheaper camera that I would recommend more to a beginner to someone who's starting out and vlogging than just your smartphone especially if it has an ultra wide lens so this is what I recommend for minimalist vlogging a lot of people also want to start using action cameras as logging cameras because they seem really convenient and easy to use but I would probably skip that and instead go a little bit better if you're willing to invest money before that I would just stick to your smart phone if you are gonna go action camera I'd probably get something like the insta 361 hour just because it's modular it can be a bunch of different things and most of the time I would be using something like that in the 360 mode and then just reframing afterwards but that's not very conducive for vlogging so I don't recommend action cameras for vlogging I just I don't think the image is that great and your smartphone does it better now if you do want to step it up and spend some money to get a little bit better quality what I do recommend I think the camera that I I think I would recommend the Canon RP because it's full-frame so you're gonna get that what nice wide angle it's got a flip LCD screen the autofocus is really great it's easy to use the menus all of that stuff and the price is reasonable so you're not gonna have to sell an arm and a leg to get it it is one of the most underrated cameras I think for vloggers and youtubers the only problem is is that it's kind of hard to get a nice wide angle lens for it because if you want the lens that I think you should be using which is this one the 15 to 35 that costs $2,300 which is a lot of money like a lot of money and the other options are only 24 millimeters and they're still pretty expensive but what you can do is buy the adapter so that you can put EF mount lenses on here which costs about $100 and then you can get something like the canon ef-s 10 to 18 mil which is $279 not too bad or the Canon EF 17 of 40 which is 6 and $50 if you're going canon EF mount lenses I would probably just buy them use and you're gonna get a pretty good deal on those and the only other thing that you're gonna need is that good audio so I probably just get something like this the road micro it's not too expensive and it's gonna give you nice audio especially in comparison to the built-in microphones and if you want to go hardcore YouTube like the best of the best then you get a 1 DX mark just kidding this this would have been my recommendation like a couple years ago but no need for this to me right now I've probably said this a bunch of times to you guys the King for something like vlogging in YouTube is this the Canon EOS R that I'm using right now it's not crazy expensive but it's full-frame the autofocus the flip LCD screen the high bitrate so the image is really nice the C log for dynamic range if none of these make any sense to you then you're probably not ready for the EOS R yet there's no extra bells and whistles it's kind of just bare-bones and that's why a lot of people like to hate on the EOS R but I think anybody who's tried it for vlogging would agree that it is the best or one of the best vlogging cameras that there is right now and then the best lens to go along with that is the 15 to 35 it is expensive but it is the best range I think for vlogging nice and wide and then you can get a little bit tighter when you need to or when you want to get some cool b-roll or anything like that and if you want the best audio I would recommend the rode videomic pro plus it's gonna give you really nice audio it turns on when you turn on your camera really nice and easy to use it just works well but we do have to keep in mind that the new Canon r5 is coming out which is like the EOS R except it has all of the fancy bells and whistles it's got the slo-mo it's got the 8 K it has all of these things that we never ever thought we could get in a camera and did you hear the rumor I heard on Canon rumors that the price is gonna be below $4,000 us that's a lot of money still but that is way cheaper than I ever imagined I thought it was gonna be closer to like $10,000 with those specs yeah that's very exciting so that will probably become the top-of-the-line vlogging camera as good as it gets the future 1dx mark - and then the eos r will be next and then the RP I sound like a Canon fanboy but honestly Canon is just maybe by accident making the best cameras for vlogging right now in my opinion except for the good old trusty smartphone and I hope companies like Sony with their a7 s3 listen to us more and give us the same great specs that they always do but then also add on things like a flip LCD screen and give us an even better vlogging camera than Canon is doing I am all for the best camera I have no loyalties I've signed nothing I will 100% switch to any company that makes a better camera for me and with that being said these are just my opinions for vlogging YouTube cameras these are not the best overall cameras for everything if we were talking specifically about wedding photography or videography I would have very different recommendations if we were talking about corporate videos or cinematic documentaries I would have very different recommendations these are what I think are the best vlogging cameras the best cameras for YouTube right now also Sony please just deal with the menus the menus are not the best I don't think it's that hard to make them a little bit more simple a little bit nicer maybe you know take a peek at what Canon is doing and make it a little bit more clean I think that'll help you guys along ok I think that's it for me I'm gonna try to hopefully get some power in this office again and I am still on the peak design tripod if you were wondering so I can do you know cool vlogging shots like this alright see you guys and even though the 1d x mark ii may not be the best vlogger camera it's still a really really great camera but I am selling this guy so if you went on piyah 1 DX mark - I don't know make me an offer
