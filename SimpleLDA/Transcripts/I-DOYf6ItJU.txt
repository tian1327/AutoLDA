 hey everybody this is a solo about that life with me I am right now in Toronto if you can see it behind me right on the lakeshore downtown I'm actually here for work and then go into New York to do some other work and see my family which is really cool but also with the Cova tonight teen virus I'm actually thinking it's gonna be quite interesting being New York because the state's under a state of emergency so we'll see how that goes but right now I'm exploring Toronto hopefully gonna go to a hockey game maybe check out some museums we'll see what I can fit in on the other side of work but just wanted to show you my view and check out Lake Ontario   good seeing my family so this is uh my dad Dan since everybody my brother Andrew yeah his girl Ruby hi and there soon to be a little one isn't there yeah to be named so I'm about to head to New York's see uh kind of a ground zero of all this Cove in nineteen craziness is all about so guys wish me luck good luck don't come back it was great to you guys do too many beloved much love and I'll check in from New York peace peace out so catching the train into New York things gonna be very light today so I'm on the metro-north train right now in south into New York City and as I expected we're pretty far down the line now we just patched the Chappaqua which is probably about halfway on the way to New York from where I'm at on the Connecticut New York border with my family and it's pretty empty so just gonna give you a quick view of the Train still waiting to see what Grand Central look like but I'm suspecting that I'll be pretty late as well but here you go so for those of you who haven't been to Grand Central or New York this is pretty light it's not empty it's not like post-apocalyptic horror movie right but uh it's surprisingly light so I'll just give you a quick run around so you can see just how a few people are here right now well it is a beautiful night in New York City on my first night so just to give you guys a time frame reference it is Sunday March 15th and I'm on my way to my hotel running through Bryant Park on the way and I'll let you see in a second but it is empty they're doing some construction so that might have something to do with it but usually don't pass through here without you know a good amount of people sitting around especially on a beautiful night like tonight so it's looking like it's gonna be a little strange already even though I think the worst is yet to come in a week or two  so on the lighter note I'm staying at a hotel that was recommended to me from a friend at work shoutout to Pamela it's called yo tell it's right in Midtown close to Times Square and Empire State and all that and as you can see it's really funky and modern it actually looks like it was designed by Japanese sex robots they actually have an actual robot in the lobby no front desk person it's all automatic and I'll just give you a sense of the room it's really kind of modular space it's pretty cool with like an automatic bed that goes up to give you more room and I got a nice view of the Empire State so I'll just give you a quick tour of the room all right go bid nineteen Diaries my last day in New York is Tuesday the 17th happy st. Patty's Day everybody now even though there's no parade and margins are close and all the restaurants are closed Times Square still got some people in it like it always will but it is definitely lighter than usual so we're gonna walk through just a second and just so you can see like how much stuff has changed even the last like three days I've been here     all right so leaving ground zero bid nineteen it's actually dead here I went straight to TSA literally walked up took my shoes off went through the line also if you look at the bar over here they shut down all the bars you can do like drinks and food and stuff like that but it has to be to go can't actually sit in the common area so you can't sit in the common area in the airport so not a whole lot of logic there but at least they're trying to limit you know large crowds of people as you can see I got a cold buff mask and mostly because I ran into a group of randoms who started talking to me and offered me their ex dress so when they get in on all the hype and gonna walk you over to my gate just  all right so left I'm checking in on the trip just for did my Southwest flight and there's literally 20 people on the whole air okay one good side effect I've gotten my own row this entire sequence of Sidious so just check it out real quick you can see behind me sumit spread out take a nap and bouts I'm here to wake me up so it's going to be awesome and back in Colorado I'm in my apartment is Monday March 23rd I have been in my apartment for six days now haven't gone out I haven't seen anybody isolating myself because of everything going on New York and if you've been paying attention at all to the New York situation the Javits Center was they basically turned into a giant field hospital with you know the National Guard health workers it was basically about a block or two from my colleague Pamela's apartment that I shut it out in one of the videos so I spent you know quite a bit of time in that area in the grocery store that all those workers are using now they weren't there when I was there so but it's got more real you know when I was there it was much more you know you could tell something was going on but um you know it was New York you know that's all the forget about it we've seen it all you know everyone kind of has this bravado on and a lot of that's changed now my colleague Pamela actually her her building has its first recorded case of kovat 19 another Lee gentleman who's unfortunately probably not gonna make it she just helped him with his groceries on Friday so she's obviously worried and she's isolating herself in her apartment now and she has some pre-existing medical conditions that makes her a risk case and if she does catch it so been spending a lot of time thinking about this and for those of you don't know me I'm not really a person to give in to you know irrational fear or you know kind of a media hype or any regard for personal safety for for better or worse but this one kind of you know it has me shook a little bit because you know when it's kind of an unknown an invisible force and it just kind of makes you wary of everything you know I'm like hunkered down in my apartment across the street once and it felt weird to just be outside you're kind of eyeballing everything like it you know it's dangerous and you know it's just a weird situation to be in and I'm you know just it's become more personal for me I'm worried about Pamela I'm worried about family I'm worried about Bob's death the most you know it's you know it's it's a real thing and it's only gonna be getting worse over the next week or two so I don't have any you know really inspirational words for you I don't know you know where this is all gonna go but I think you know Bob really had it right in his video when he said even though we're forced to you know be distant from one another in our personal spaces we should still be connected as a community and if this virus proves anything is that being selfish as a society and you know having haves and have-nots you know we're all interconnected having have-nots makes makes life dangerous for everybody so I really hope this kind of is a chance for us all to realize that we're interconnected no matter where in the world we are no matter what our politics are you know what food we eat all the stuff that people have you know ridiculous you know hatreds and violence over at the end of the day we're all human beings and you know and putting others at risk only comes back to you in the end so I really all I can say is I hope you and your family and your friends are all safe and that we come out of this you know stronger and better than ever before so signing out for now hopefully Bobby and I will be going on trips before too long but I suspect it's gonna be a while so you know take care of yourselves  you
