  so today is Monday May 4th I don't know about where you guys live but for me our stay at home water is through the 31st I never made a video like this the whole quarantine so I thought better late than never another day and I'm grateful for that you guys this is not gonna cut it I actually had a day last week where I didn't make it as soon as I woke up and I waited till like 4:00 o'clock and I think that is why I had a bad day so we need to fix this I'm not wearing pants you see anything don't look okay this is my workout outfit for the day just a little Oreo action from fabletics I did not work out yesterday so we've got to do the thing this is kind of it Wow I wear this while working out all right let's do that every single morning I cut up some strawberries before I work out because usually I am starving in the morning but I don't want to eat anything before I work out it's this beard thing you've got to figure out this is the level of laziness I'm at because I don't want to dirty a dish and then have to wash that dish so we put it in the hand it makes a great bowl  I feel like I have turned into such a grandma this quarantine I come out here I'll read I'll drink my coffee who never thought that'd be me but it's honestly really great I'm a cool grandma it's like every day or every other day kind of depending all I switch it up with doing a bunch of arms and more fast-paced ones and more leg heavy ones just so that I'm not doing the same thing too much yeah my studio has been renting these out so it's been so nice because this used to be my favorite thing to do before all this happened we're gonna do that and then I think I'm gonna do some glutes and abs  workout is done that was a good 40 ish minute sesh and what is going on here why this thing vibrating hello oh hi mom hello I'm just gonna eat a little apple banana I feel like I thought people know what this is but I always get comments why are your bananas so small first of all they're much better than normal bananas that is the one perk about Hawaii is that Apple bananas are indeed a thing they're cute and small but packed with deliciousness they're just a lot sweeter I find myself when I'm in the mainland I just I can't call me piggy call me spoiled but I just need Apple bananas there's so much sweeter they're so good I just made this water I'm gonna try and drink this whole thing before I make my coffee just so that I'm hydrating so I believe that coffee isn't hydrating but I could be wrong we're in a shower and finish this a mistake I used to make a lot was waiting after I worked out to shower and wash my face and I feel like it's one thing waiting an hour ish to shower if you're like eating and you're not super sweaty but I would always just let my sweat stay on my skin and like the dirt oil and stuff and I think that's what was contributing to breakouts and stuff because obviously it's not good obviously it's not optimal to have that stuff sit on your face every workout so I've been trying to wash my face or at least like rinse it off after a workout and I've noticed that the skins doing a little bit better I don't know if it's just that but I definitely feel like that contributes to it  so I just showered posted an Instagram picture if you guys have been following me on Instagram then you know I have been stepping up the game not well now that I'm all clean it is time for the most important part of every single day Animal Crossing yes at first I was like this is so boring out and what I'm doing but now that I figured it out it is so much fun I'm going to take this downstairs and take my book and make my coffee free to play games it's the best of both worlds yes I've been loving just come outside listen to the construction work drink my coffee play and read he's a great time  here's the thing so Monday's usually I either try to get a lot of stuff done like filming but I'm doing that right now I feel like I want to do stuff and I want to do stuff anyways because oh my gosh last night I was lying in my bed laying my arms and get so mad at me I always forget whether it's laying or lying I don't know why English I don't know I was about to sleep in my bed and I realized I had not stepped foot out of my house yesterday which is crazy not even to go outside and usually that's part of like my morning routine to go sit outside but for some reason the vibes were pretty weird and I just did it today I kind of want to just get out a little bit obviously there are some restrictions to that but I don't even care I just want to like go for a drive I want to get some yummy food because I've been having some crazy cravings mostly for french fries I don't know why the past four days if you ask anyone in my family that's all I've been talking about and it just needs to be done it just needs to happen so I think that's what I'm gonna do I don't want to do like a beach day thing but I kinda want to just drive down to North Shore and support a local restaurant and get some yummy food I just that sounds so good I think I'll just end up going for myself because I used to spend so much time by myself before all this and I have it and he's so long and I kind of improving that I just want to do something fun and enjoy my own company because I was working on that so much before this whole quarantine thing of trying to be more okay with spending time by myself and not wearing so much about oh my gosh I'm alone I can't do things alone I've gotten so good at that and I just want to keep doing that I'm not gonna go for too long obviously because there's no point I can't really sit inside a restaurant or anything cuz that's not allowed right now and I still have school stuff to do because it's in Monday so we've got to get school stuff done but first we're gonna do this I haven't eaten yet so I think I'm gonna save my appetite to have a nice big meal and I'm so so excited for it I'm gonna do my makeup I haven't done my makeup I just put on three products and I feel like a whole brand-new woman I'm gonna add some red lip balm it is such a nice day out today I can't wait show you guys the drive there it's one of my favorites it's so pretty ready to go oh my oh my we are ready to go ha it feels so good to be in my car to go somewhere safely of course I got the mask we've got a 25 minute drive ahead of us it's such a nice one I can't wait to just get out of this house and listen to music do the thing and have you guys come with me this is so exciting it's like a little date I will talk to you guys when we get to our destination  yeah  okay I just arrived at did I say that weird and I just arrived at my destination I am treating myself today like I said I'm craving fries so I got a chicken bag with garlic bread sure it should be coming out soon and I'm so excited about it if you don't want to see really delicious food that's gonna make you super hungry even though I suggest that you do because it's gonna be so so good watch the next oh look at heart oh wow it's literally it's such a nice day because people like fishing over there and there's people paddleboarding three perfect day my dad wants french fries and a milkshake so I'm gonna pick that up for him and then head home I have school stuff to do I think I made it back home it's still very early in the day it's only 243 which is awesome it's time to get down and dirty and do school it's gotta be done the one thing about online school that not sucks but sucks you really have to be self disciplined to do it because I can totally put it off and stuff and that just would not be good so anyways I think I'm gonna bring my computer outside and do some work I just don't really feel like being in my room and it's a super pretty day out let's do that  done for the day I'm gonna do an unboxing of one item this is been sitting in my Sephora basket for longest time I just waited for the sale so that I can get it for a cheaper price you might be wondering Eva what is that this is the nurse Jaime uplift massaging Beauty Roller I have seen so many people use this I always watch on YouTube those allure or Harper's Bazaar videos of different celebrities and famous people doing their makeup or their skincare and I always see them talking about this and it's just so fun to roll in your face I read it till I could get it for a cheaper price and it finally came in I'm so excited to use this maybe we'll try it out together tonight that'll be really fun it has a rolling hexagon head and ergo not making handle this sounds crazy cool so we'll try to sell it later today was a good day I feel like there are days where I literally do nothing and I used to feel bad about that but now it's kind of like okay dude it's literally fun you don't have to be this productive machine every single day of your life but yeah overall I've been spending a lot of time with family which is just the best thing and it's been so fun hanging out with my sister all the time I just started a new class for school I talked about it before but if you don't know I just started my SEO class which has been so interesting so far my sandwich burger and french fries we're so good I decided to get garlic fries I don't know if I told you guys that but I just feel so satisfied it is let's see what I can cross off school done worked out and you just check if my credit card was paid I'm pretty sure I set that up adulting it's been nice to still create somewhat of a schedule because during this time there is really just no schedule and if I don't have a general idea of what I want to do my head the whole day is just a mess so this thing has helped me so much I've seen in spam stories that you guys have tagged me in of how you
