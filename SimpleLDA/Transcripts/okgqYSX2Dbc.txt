  tonight's cloth is going on for a really long time this is the longest I came out to my little secret secluded place okay I don't really need to be wearing this I just had a realization I don't know if anyone else can relate to this but sometimes when I have a secret spot that I think only I know about not that only I know about it but somewhere where I want to have for myself and I go there and I find someone else is there whether it be just a place that I like to sit by the river or this place where I filmed my quarantine tag video is not actually on the other side of this building is this nice little area with chairs I mean I'm on the other side which is fine but it made me realize Who am I to think that this is my spot like oh this is my little spot this is my place to sit it's my area it's like no Melanie the world does not belong to you only there's other people in it who want to go the same places he goes you so I shouldn't get it no I don't know why I feel annoyed cuz I go over there I see this woman doing these stretches standing in my spot and I was like okay so made me realize don't be selfish anyway welcome to week five not week five welcome to week six seven and eight nine I don't know what week we're on now I can't keep track anymore but having to upload a video since week five so this is going to be what I've been up to since my last vlog so I hope you enjoy  today's family painting day today we're doing the anxiety relief mountains landscape painting my brush using a bit of water  Mille just have fun in stop stressing out just do your best like it doesn't have to be perfect am I the only one having fluttered out  around it so instead of just going straight the blue it's gonna reflect the sky that's so cool all right so this is the finished product I'm not super happy with it I feel like it needs something but I guess we'll just leave it for now    this is our live stream setup for today  going to get coffee because honestly I've been getting so sick of just drinking the same K cup watery coffee at home I feel like there's at least one thing that happens everyday that makes me question am I losing my mind today I was looking down the street and I see this man and I was like is he walking does he have a little pet pig and he's he walking his Pig on the sidewalk and it's a little dog with the pink jacket on it and I'm like am i okay like what's happening so things are like right now there's lime pretty much any store that's still open like that's a beauty store they have lines outside only a few people in at a time most places are closed though honestly like this coffee shop I went she taught her to walk to it because a lot of the other coffee shops are closed I'm just so grateful to have good coffee and I used offal tea for the very first time which is exciting I only had cash and they were all an accepting card or Apple pay I didn't have a card on me  needed a change of scenery this is actually the farthest I've been since this whole pandemic started usually I've been keeping with in my neighborhood directly but today I walked farther down I'm at Columbia University now the place I got food from it was really amazing they're doing this thing where you donate ten dollars and that money goes to serve meals to the frontline workers there's somebody who's wearing a cap and gown which I'm really interested in wondering like what's graduation like are they doing it six feet apart graduation or something like how does that work or are they just handing them out and then people are taking pictures another failed meal literally a frozen meal that like how do you mess it up I don't know I set the timer I put it on ice turn it occasionally but still I guess I didn't stir in enough cuz it burned another failed meal tried to make probe's there's smoke everywhere I can't do this the thing is I was scared of burning them so I took them off but then the inside was frozen so I don't know what to do I mean it's like you burn the outside the inside is frozen I can't cook okay we're gonna try this again except this time instead of doing on the stove since it burned I'm gonna try to bake it so hopefully this works because I ruin everything so these are the loaded baked potato pierogies this was a fail so we're gonna try this period oven to 400 ok oven is preheated spray cooking sheet and both sides of frozen pierogies with nonstick cooking spray both sides of pierogies so you spray the pan and both Sun this is why I can't I can't do this bake 18 to 20 minutes until the golden brown and puffed turning half way through big time so the problem is it says golden brown so the problem with this saute is last time it was golden brown and burnt but it wasn't eight minutes and it wasn't cooked on the inside so I don't know how to do this okay are they puffy and golden brown okay so they don't look burnt which is the good news but one of them is kind of exploding I don't know if that could have been avoided now is the moment of truth let's see okay so they're slightly rubbery but they're not bad oh my gosh this is amazing I guess we're having neighbors movie night hello blankets  Lionsgate is streaming these free movies apparently every Friday night so tonight is Long Island he won Best Director at age 32 oh they're raising money for movie theaters I think we'll have my wine so I'm ready oh my gosh I just I remember watching this movie in the theaters being so blown away I'm like the first opening scene of this the way that it's filmed the way the camera just pans like those continuous shots and you watch the motion in the camera just follows along and you just it doesn't cut it's it's just amazing the thing I love so much about this movie is it shows like the reality makes with the fantasy like we have this like romanticized musical like idea of the world like moving to a new city like LA New York but then it cuts to the reality of actually you're just sitting in traffic for hours and hours and actually if you want to be an actress you're gonna like go through all this rejection and all that stuff and the love portion the love story portion of it not to ruin the ending if you haven't seen it but it's just so good jazz was born in a little house so much  he's like and it's dying I remember watching this in theaters like crying we cooking during quarantine this movie is just so good this ending sequence though so good  that movie is just so good Damien Chazelle Wow right good news good news everyone Delhi has reopened so don't have to starve to death which is a good time today is such a beautiful day so I figured I would go for a bike ride because one thing I've been wanting to do since all of this started is I'm so curious to see what Times Square is like and what downtown with no tourists looks like obviously not getting on the subway not taking uber not really touching anything I'm just gonna get a bike and go down there this is so sad they looks like they indefinitely are closing down this beer garden suicide it was just such a nice place to come have a beer outside on a nice night especially when the weather is getting more we've already stressful there's so many people in the past it's so weird being down here this is like the farthest away I've been for my apartment in over a month I feel like a little kid again when your parents are like okay you can go outside but don't go too far away from home I don't want anything to happen I made it to 40th Street and there's the Empire State Building it's so fun to be in a new place I feel like that newfound excitement of when I used to visit New York before I moved here getting a glass of rose a to go in New York feel like I'm in New Orleans where you can just get alcohol to go it's so fun made it to you at Times Square area so weird seem like you know before I got to know of a nice day usually when you come down here it's packed like jam-packed you can't even walk tourists everywhere people taking pictures people stopping but now it's just some people on bikes it's a few cars so weird made it to Times Square testing out my gimbal hopefully this is balanced  yeah I just I really was curious to see what Time Square would look like with no tourists so yeah there's not really that many people around this is so weird because usually there's so many people the line for tickets to my Broadway shows but there's no one there the Disney Store is closed yeah pretty much everything is closed down I mean McDonald's open yeah forever21 clothes so all the stores are closed so there's not really that many people about it was just like a few sparingly there's just one couple who's running around blasting Frank Sinatra I forgot it's 7 p.m. and every day at 7:00 they do the the clop in the chair for the essential workers so I just heard some people honking their horns and stuff I was just thinking Earth Day recently passed and I remember coming out here when Chris was visiting in New York he was like in Times Square they're gonna do Earth Hour and they're gonna shut off all the lights not all the lights but most of them and so we were so curious we were like we need to see what it looks like it's gonna be so crazy seeing x squared dark an hour on usually the last Saturday in March usually big cities and things around the world turn off their lights for one hour but right now we are in Times Square and you can see it but they've either dimmed or turned off all the non-essential lights within reason this is cool Jr's sign is out jr. thanks if you look back this is crazy because time Spurs always like the brightest oh it's very quiet you can't hear Time Square you just know quiet that was a year ago or was it two years ago now I think it was a year ago I'll have to go back and search through my old memories but I just think that's so interesting because now kind of doing the same thing I'm like oh I need to go see what Times Square looks like not when it's dark because I still need to bike home I think for many of us we started out this whole situation with a lot of a lot of like a lot of fear a lot of anxiety a lot of unknowns I think we're at the point now that it's been a month we're kind of used to the new normal if that's what you want to call it we're all I kind of settle into our home routines used to wearing masks outside used to washing your hands and all that stuff it's kind of like shocking at first and your whole world is basically turned upside down but I think we're many of us are just settled in to this weird style of living and I just wonder I wonder how long it's gonna take for things to get back to normal for like the Tories to start coming back you know how when are people gonna want to start visiting New York again I thought it was really interesting to come out today to see how empty it is well that was a fun adventure this is Harry Potter and the cursed child honestly this is just so this is so this is eerie this is just a weird feelings there's literally no one on this street me and one other person up there sokka's me and Alex were supposed to come see this I forgot when I mean whatever things are back to normal who knows when that will be but it's weird it's Saturday night in New York City Broadway closed completely quiet no one on the street except for me on a beautiful night it's a really weird feeling it's got my bike to head back home biking through New York  and honestly when I first moved to New York I moved here with my bike and I was so intimidated this is really annoying them fellows kind of is so intimidating because there's like so many cars zooming past you and people it's really crazy but now we're in a nice time and there's like not as many cars on the road and it's a little less stressful so I can just kind of do a leisurely bike ride hopefully it doesn't get dark by the time I get home made it back good timing so getting dark  beyo cross-eyed you
