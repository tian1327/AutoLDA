 this video could change your life forever I mean probably not but it might you never know but first drinking a hazy IPA from Deschutes everybody is drinking Hayes's right now and I am a part of everybody what they taste good this one is even better because this can is a proper English pint and it's a scientifically proven fact that those extra three ounces make the beer taste better I've never thought of myself as a qualified giver of advice about life success or anything else except for booze I'll advise you on booze all day but I was reminded of a universal truth yesterday and I want to share it let's say I'm channeling my inner Tony Robbins this truth pertains to the video I did yesterday which if you haven't seen it you should jump over and watch it right now and like share and subscribe this video kept me up until 2 in the morning why it wasn't that complicated the most stress it should have caused me is whether or not the song I used would get a copyright claim it kept me up because I let multiple things get in the way of finishing it there was one voice in my head telling me that I should not be doing these things and another voice telling me that I had time and I listened to the second voice you could say they were important things and you might be right but they got in the way because I let them some time between midnight and 1:00 a.m. while I was nowhere near finished my own voice kicked back in saying the only thing between you and your goals is your own bad habits the owner of the bar I work out who's as business savvy as he is nice once told me that there are no bad ideas just ideas without action this got me thinking how does some people accomplish so much with their lives while other people accomplish nothing the Henry Ford's and the Elon Musk's of the world had the same number of hours in their day as I do you could say they're smarter than me and you'd be right but I don't want to colonize Mars I just want to make silly videos on the Internet I'm speaking for personal experience here these words are my own 95% of success is time management start early and you'll finish early never start and you'll never finish the biggest sense of personal accomplishment I feels when I hit that upload button I have mine and you have yours you can feel that sense of accomplishment at 6 p.m. or at 2:00 in the morning except at that point you're so wound up you can't get to bed and end up sitting on your sofa drinking rum until 4:00 a.m. you also run the risk of trying your spouse's patience I mean not me but theoretically life is a game of chess and the opponent sitting across from you it was time take control of your time because you can't get it back
