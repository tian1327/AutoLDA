mean people is still driving around but there's not a lot of people like walking the street so in the stores things are clearly closed yeah which is good that's like really safe but it's just we've never seen lla like this it's just wild like our generation hasn't experienced something like a crisis like this but this is like a two on one with the pandemic but then that has caused such a financial I just I mean it's where I think we're in a recession and technically okay yeah are not I saying it's like very gloomy yeah well the times are like this is happening people could get sick because of all that people can now not afford yeah to pay rent and that all that stuff and then if they do get sick that's even worse you know what I mean there's just like a lot but it's it's crazy but it is interesting for people like us like I mentioned earlier you know some of you know our projects and stuff on hold so like we're not working in that regard we're very fortunate as youtubers to be able to keep working like this just keep posting videos because we work from home they do this from home so we can continue doing you know these videos and Jess has been able to do some of the brand deals that she's had this week as well and we're very very fortunate to have that so calling our thoughts and prayers are very much situation who are either and lost their jobs or just don't have as many hours and struggling to pay rent and bills it's like sending love your way guys this whole conversation might be really anxious for a lot of people Mike yes anxiety guys I read it a tweet today not the best place to get information from but I read a tweet about a lot of positives yeah I said I've happened ooh  yeah it was like they're working on a vaccine that they're testing now that might work and China's already in the recovery stages so like there's a light at the end of the tunnel at the end of the tunnel and I think that's a positive to look forward to as we're like in the valley of it all right now hope you guys are just staying that's my rant and cautious yeah and safe yeah try to make the most out of this situation enjoy your family enjoy your friends on FaceTime
