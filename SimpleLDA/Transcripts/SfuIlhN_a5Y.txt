 okay so I'm doing rollerblading for the first time ever well I've done it when I was like seven years old but I'm trying them right now and I'm so scared all right here goes oh my god good they have the car right here so today's been a long and productive day I woke up at 6:00 in the morning and I went for a row with my mom and then I got home lifting some weights I got a haircut obviously you can tell right maybe you can't because it looks the same all the time because I get a haircut once a week and right now I just came back from washing my car and I went to get some coffees for my mom and to myself I have been drinking this Starbucks teto approved drink for the past year already and I freaking love it so much the one that got me really into it as my friend Liz she's the one that was in my video a long time ago she was in the video not my hands challenge and that was like super funny and it was super awesome it was like one of the first few challenges that I ever did it for my YouTube videos so yeah she told me about this recipe and I've been using it like every single time I go to Starbucks so thanks Liz for the addiction and I know you guys are saying Michael why are the hell are you wearing a mask if there's nobody around you I wearing a mask because I'm ugly okay I got to go home I got to give this coffee to my mom before it starts to melt because it's freaking hot today you know I was on Twitter snapchat Instagram Facebook all of that stuff and the riots and LA are freaking crazy I even saw clips from Seattle and Seattle is like a disaster there's like everything's on fire people breaking in stuff I think National Guard's are now there so yeah the whole world right now is like so chaotic and I am waiting here in line for in and out of as you can see right and there's a guy over there preaching it's so crazy out there all I'm trying to do is get some in and out as most of you know there was a lot of riots yesterday and I'm here in Santa Ana and it was pretty peaceful and then it got really violent there was a lot of people being sent to the hospitals and it was just so crazy so I'm actually gonna go to the scene where they vandalized and broke into the smart and final and so yeah I'm gonna head there right now let's go check it out yes so they have the news reporters here because they vandalized this smart and final here and there's all the vandalism on the other side so they blocked off all this whole section and they vandalized all this here for all this up too and the whole section the whole plaza too they closed off the whole section you can see the glass broken into oh my God look at that autozone they really didn't like that autozone and they're good people out there cleaning up look at all that mess look at Santa Ana College okay so I'm here with Ariel and we want to get some coffee because that's always a must when were with her and we came to the mall because malls are now opened actually where I main Place Mall as you can see the thing is that there's not a lot of people so okay that's a good thing yeah I think that's super funny of that they would have the mall open but not the stores I've never seen them all so empty ever yeah that was always empty like no one really goes there but Main Place Mall is usually always so crowded and it's freakin empty let me show you a little bit more look at that everything's shut down the Wi-Fi lounge closed for cleaning all right then have the only throw open but do you want to buy anything for me oh my god a 50% off okay let's go inside okay so Ariel finally bought some things that she's probably gonna return later anyway that's for sure there you go see that's just the way it is it goes what it thank you ooh where is it we're gonna go check if barn Sandoval is open hurry up green light I'll go press a light come on you're gonna leave me that's true it is open really oh my gosh that is so exciting that Barnes & Nobles is open because that's like a place where I used to go study for like all my college classes and then Ariel started studying there for all her college classes and then sometimes we would just go just for fun it sounds like perfect I'll take a little bit yes one hands get look at the streets I'm gonna buy this for my next ghost hunting this thing freakin fell I know I'm super super surprised to like I literally touched it I put it there and then if what okay so we came now to the block or now it's called the outlets of orange but we're always gonna call it the block because that's how I grew up here and that's just the name of it okay and it was so funny because we were driving and then from far away we saw these figures over there right we thought it was aligned to go somewhere a little bit more crowded here stores are obviously not opened this stores closed that one's closed that one's open but there's a line for a Paxson a little bit more crowded oh no it's closed yeah still same thing like Main Place Mall it was closed a lot of the stores are closed none of the useful ones are opened and it's freaking hot but it was more crowded here there was actually lines to go inside stores it says please practice social distancing I'm already a pro oh my god they're they're looting just getting another they're tagging coming soon and yeah none of the stores here are opened as well this is Westminister mall as you can see it's pretty much dead I think that everybody's tired from the right yesterday so that's why they're not here here's a little back story about this thing right so me and Ariel used to come here we stack up every single Sunday every single Saturday as well to just play this game and we will actually Ariel one air pods from here so yeah after we got those air pods Ariel went to go get them checked they were fake they were freakin fake so don't spring your money on that machine because it's not worth it unless you want to get finger puzzle that's fine we came to another mall break em off it's a little crowded here actually come on let's go let's go let's go  No Oh Oh can I do the cinnamon sugar the sugar butter nice look at that look at mine finally we went to a dining restaurant I almost felt like I forgot how it feels like to be in a dining restaurant and I've never been to lazy dogs either but I belong here because I'm a dog so peppers now
