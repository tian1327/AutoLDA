  good morning good afternoon or good evening you're new here I'm Kaiser welcome to my channel wow it's super windy right now so sorry the audio is kind of bad anyway for today  going on our little hike so lately I've been thinking maybe after all donnager lager our podcaster for sure I actually do want to talk about a certain topic again so podcast number to see how it goes i strictly studying right now but it's too nice to be inside thankfully the winds god that's a good thing and what I want to talk about today is no complaint so I usually use to complain a lot of things one is schoolwork or stress or complaining that I've been eating working out as much you know little things like that and then there's this one time me and my family went to a grocery store and I saw somebody take it off the trash and this person was way older to me and there's a lot of not working there or way wiser you know more knowledge more mature and I was thinking to myself if these people are working continuously without complaining at the age that they are what gives me a room to complain in the first place  take a break a little bit kind of out of breath if I complain so much such little things like schoolwork how would I make it out you know I already have a part-time work where I do research and study at the same time what I found out is the more I put myself out there the more I'm able to really see how people deal with service that helps me to just be kind you don't know what that person is working towards excuse me for sure you're gonna be mindful of people around me if I just bump into me almost it thankfully not so back to my talk there's people that are constantly working way older than me and more mature more knowledge and I was wondering why can't they just use that time to stay at home and appreciate the time they have left for their loved ones that's when it hit me that time they're using that doesn't necessarily mean is for their work but it's for the people they love their stock is pricing that time in order to provide for their loved ones in order for their loved ones to be able to obtain that the goals that they couldn't have but ever since that day that I would spend with my family traveling places I realized that I should also appreciate the time I have with my work when I'm watching this video I'm gonna promise myself I'm gonna appreciate my time more no matter where I'm at you should too so if you're watching this video you're also promising yourself I appreciate the time you have more to really understand more of what you're working before we just take this time to appreciate how nice this neighborhood is so spring is coming and the beautiful trees are starting to bloom matter of fact just an appreciation of how nice to stay where it is I'm gonna keep walking keep walking I'm gonna keep talking because I like to talk sorry it's also nice to blog and be able to see how you progress in some way because when we talk to other people it's not like you can hear yourself talk to those people when you're vlogging you get to see what's been on your mind that day and understand more of who you are I always told myself to not be as open as I should be I was actually scared to continue this whole thing too because you know in some way we all like to stay mysterious or importantly I have been here as to what it's like to maybe walk around another country or even just another state and do this kind of thing there's some crazy vloggers out there who constantly use vlogging or podcasts or video production for their own business I'm talking primarily people that are using it to travel and look like that and I also want to take this time to appreciate the work they've done because it's opened up so many things for young people maybe more mature people of getting tired of working a regular nine-to-five or the job that they've been working on for sure haven't been smiling as much as I showed in this video but I'm okay about a week or so if plans go accordingly can't wait for you guys to see
