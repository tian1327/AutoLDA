 what's up guys i just decided that i wanted to film a little vlog today because my family's going a little stir crazy and quarantined it's saturday and it's really nice outside so we decided that we're gonna go on a little drive to manhattan i'm just kind of curious to see what's happening there i don't think it'll be too crowded but it is a nice day so i wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people are outside but yeah my family's been doing a lot of drives recently just because it's really nice to get a change of scenery after being stuck inside and working all week i think it'll be really nice and i don't know i'm i kind of want to just see when manhattan is like empty because i only see it super crowded all the time so this should be interesting and yeah we'll see above it  wow  kind of support them so yeah definitely a lot of people still walking around um oh it's like wearing masks and stuff that's so cute i don't know if you can even do that but magnolia but not that many cars on the road which is good and definitely not as crowded as a normal spring day in new york would be  so  it's not every day we can drive around like this   you do look like a movie star having your driver escort you around it's time for coffee i was just gonna say that it's so crazy to think that i lived here a couple months ago and now everything has changed and i was kind of forced to leave i mean i left by choice i could have quarantined here but this is like a major hot spot for the virus so i wouldn't have wanted to put myself at that type of risk i wouldn't want wouldn't have wanted to put myself at risk like that but yeah just being back now even though it's warm weather when everyone usually comes into the city on the weekend it is really empty compared to what it normally is i just miss life normal in general that sounded so sad  so i guess i didn't really explain why i moved out of my apartment or anything i mean i kind of did but basically my i was supposed to be working and living in the city from january till the end of april in um an apartment that i was leasing from that does that make sense yeah i was supposed to work in the city from january to april and i had a sublet so i was gonna live here for those four months but since coronavirus and all that stuff happened i decided to move back in mid-march so my team at the company i was working at was already transitioning to start working full-time from home so that we don't have to physically see each other to work more remotely and protect ourselves against the virus before the company or most of the major companies especially in this area put in the fact that i was only essential workers so i was working from home in my apartment for a little while things were starting to get serious and it's crazy because early that week i you know i was like living normally i went to like a spin class i one of my friends asked me to go grab a drink at like a bar on like a wednesday or a tuesday and looking back on it i'm very happy i went because that's the last time i went out with anyone because spontaneously that friday i just decided like i'm gonna go home and live at home for a week or so just till things calm down cause i didn't know how long this would last and then i ended up living at home for over a week and i had to come into the city and grab all my stuff and then i came to move out because my lease was ending and i knew i wasn't going to come back and live here since this is the hot spot in the u.s for covid19 i just moved out very suddenly and i didn't expect the end of my winter spring internship to be like this so it's kind of crazy to just look back on it and be in this v now i don't know never take a moment for  granted  um  this is a little dark okay we just got back from the city i didn't really film a lot towards the end because i was getting super tired like i almost fell asleep in the car but in case you couldn't tell it was not that crowded especially for a day like today i would expect it to be super full and lots of traffic and people just being out and about it was nice to just have a little change of pace and do something different this weekend because i've just been staying home and going for walks in my own neighborhood i mean this time right now it's just so crazy and so unprecedented i don't even know what to expect but hopefully things get better soon um i wish we could have stayed in the city longer and now for the past couple of months every okay i know that every day for the past couple months a lot of the residents in new york have been going outside of their balconies or opening their windows and just cheering at 7pm for the healthcare workers which i think is super sweet and i wish that was something that i could have stayed and seen just so i could participate and recognize some people who are the essential workers during this time i think that's absolutely amazing and if you're one of those people thank you so much that means literally the world i don't know how any anyone or anything would be functioning right now if it weren't for the people that are working in the hospitals and grocery stores delivering mail and ups and all that stuff it's just we're really relying on those essential workers right now and i just wanted to express my gratitude for everything that they've done but yeah thankfully my family is back home we're safe or healthy and i hope you guys are staying safe and healthy as well yeah this has been a pretty chill vlog i haven't been able to do a lot of my normal stuff where i'm always like out and about and with friends and everything and running around the city or wherever i am but yeah i just wanted to choose something a little bit more chill and look back on this time because i don't know i'm gonna be telling my kids someday that like new york city was empty during a pandemic where there was a hot spot an epicenter of code 19 coronavirus i'll talk to you guys soon i hope you're all staying safe and healthy and i'll see ya bye
