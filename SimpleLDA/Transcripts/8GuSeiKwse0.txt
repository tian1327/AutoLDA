 hey guys it's Liz here so obviously ahead look like crap right now but I'm basically just gonna be taking you guys throughout my entire day today obviously we're in quarantine so I figured I would just do a video showing you guys like how I've been dealing with it and basically yeah basically how I've been dealing with it so I'm still in my pajamas in my room but the first thing I always do when I wake up is I actually do my workout so I'm not to change and then I'll take you guys downstairs and show you guys what I'm doing to work out       so I just finished my workout that you probably saw a clip of I couldn't get the whole thing because for some reason the first clip only recorded 10 seconds on my camera so I did a couple workouts before like I did a couple different exercises before I realize that also I don't know how the lighting is right now but um that's better I would be taking a shower right now except there's someone in the bathroom so I kind of have to wait until I get out so that's gonna be but um I might like eat something really quick like probably maybe a protein bar or like yeah probably a protein bar or something and then once I shower and get ready I'm going to the cemetery with my grandma and then once I come back I will probably be recording more things it's just like that I don't really want to record just cuz you know for personal reasons but I was thinking of doing like something about like what I eat in a day maybe in this blog as well so I'll just show you whatever I eat and whatnot right now right now I've just been drinking a lot of water because I'm tired from my workout that was only half an hour long but it felt like forever and those burpees killed me at the end so by the way if you're wondering where I get my workouts from there's a fellow youtuber her name is Kylie Jaeger Kylie Kellie Yeager she is a personal trainer and she makes guides and she I follow I've been following her at home guide right now I'm just because you know the gyms aren't opening stuff and I'm actually at home back in New York so I've been doing her at home guides and they are killer I'm on week five and I've definitely noticed like strong arms and stuff so anyway someone just went on the bathroom so I'm about to go in picture so this is my outfit today my shirt picture a secret pink these are my mom jeans these are from I think Hollister and then I just tucked my t-shirt into my bra and then I'm just wearing some gray slip-on vans and my hair is just a bun and I just put on mascara and get my eyebrows so that's today's outfit I will let you guys know if I do anything fun hey guys so I just got back from going to the cemetery with my grandma I'm about to excuse me oh my god Duncan - if you can see it behind me yeah I'm just about to do some work on my computer and then I don't know but if you guys want to see this look it's so windy outside right now um it's really like the temperature is pretty nice but it's just really windy outside so yeah hopefully I get to take my dog around her walk later because I know that she loves that but hi okay so I have my Duncan and my package and basically I'm about to just show you guys how I package stuff up when I sell something on Poshmark which I've been doing a lot recently so you can still see me um I've been doing a lot recently because I just realized that I have a lot of clothes and I don't even wear all of them I have a lot of workout stuff that I don't really wear so all the stuff that I have posted on Poshmark I keep in these little boxes under I've gotta get him out though like whenever I make a sale I'm Poshmark I will just get the item that sold so for example I sold this like tan colored Nike sports bra it's super cute I really liked this I bought it because it was on sale and it was like I love sports bras but to be honest I just don't really wear it anymore so this is my little mailer I have literally just a plain white Mallard I'll just make sure everything looks good it's all like nice and clean and obviously it's clean but then sometimes I'll put a little note in there like thank you for purchasing or whatever but seal it and not sealed and then I just have to go for it out the label and then tape it on and then if there's only like one or two packages I'll just put them in my mailbox and the mailman will take them the next day because they're already pre labeled but like the other day I had like five or six packages to send out so I had to take them to the post office because they wouldn't all fit in my mailbox so once I print the label out for this I'll probably put it out either tonight or if I wake up I don't know if I'll wake up tomorrow before the marryin cars so I'll probably put it out tonight and just hopefully the mailman um I'll take it in the morning if he doesn't take it then I'll have to take it to the post office tomorrow when I wake up but yeah basically that's just how I do by Poshmark sales but you know if you guys have any questions about Poshmark or anything like that definitely leave comments down below because I have made so much sales or I made so much money off of selling my stuff on Tosh Mar you guys have no idea I've had a Poshmark since I was 12 and by the way I'm 19 now so if habits for seven years and I've probably made like close to like six or seven hundred dollars off of selling my stuff on there so if you guys are looking for a way till I get rid of stuff and make a little bit of money off of it definitely try Poshmark especially if you have name-brand items so Nike Adidas Lululemon if you have purses you don't even like if you have nice persons like Michael Kors or you know coach or whatever if you have those you can sell those on there as well I know Michael Kors sells pretty well yeah a lot of stuff Kate Spade all that sells really well on there so yeah if you guys are looking for a place to sell your items definitely sell them on Poshmark the only thing I would say with Poshmark is they take 20% of your say help excuse me okay so if it's less than $15 they take off 295 like regardless but if it's more than $15 then they take off 20% so yeah that's the only thing the seller or your the seller so the buyer will pay for shipping you get the shipping sent to your email and yeah there's like certain like sales you can do where you can give the option of free shipping but then it would take it out of your earnings so it's not always the best idea but yeah let me guide if you guys have any questions about Poshmark definitely leaves are down below because I've pretty experienced in Poshmark like I have a lot of experience using it and the do's and don'ts and everything so yeah I would definitely suggest if you have any questions you can definitely leave them down below I'm pretty sure I also have like a $5 like referral thing that they have for like everyone so if you guys want a $35 when you sign up definitely I'll put it in the description you can click the link down there and you get five dollars off your first order I'm like Knight backwards not sure it's not an affiliate link or anything it's just like they have that as your like we're fling everybody gets one once they make an account so yeah so that's this package I'll probably figure out something else to film for you so I'm back and I tried to think of things to film for the rest of this video just because it's like but I'm totally random and pretty like all around I haven't really been doing much today so I figured I would show you guys um a little like tiny tiny mini haul of the things I got from balance yeah I bought I got these like probably a week ago but I'm super obsessed so if you guys don't know balance is an athletic wear company they're based out of Colorado they're basically like just a really good athletic wear company I have now three pairs of leggings and a pair of joggers and I'm really I really love the joggers I really like the leggings so I shopped their overstock and I got cheated pairs of leggings they're over soccer but up five items that are a little bit cheaper that they just have too many of they want to get rid of them so yes if you guys are looking to buy items from their and you need them a little bit cheaper they're not too much cheaper but just a little bit shop they're overstock items but anyways so these are the two pair of leggings I got I got these ones yes I was right these are the og pants in the color intuition they this is probably like my absolute favorite color right now it's just this really pretty mob it like matches my pants if you can see that I don't know if you can see that anyways it like matches my pants I'm so obsessed with these my favorite part about the balance leggings is this part this is in the back and the butt part right here it like goes down to the curve of your back your lower back like right to the top of your butt and I really like the little like design on the back it's just a triangle I think that's so cute and simple not about like the sign on the back really matters but I hope the lighting is good right now because I have it behind me but yeah I really like these leggings they're really soft and like buttery like that kind of material so I really hope that I where these soon but yeah these are like really soft I really like them they just look like that and these are in the size medium the other pair of leggings I got are the ascent pants and these are in the shade dawn they look like this the difference between sorry I got snap judgment the difference between the ascent pants and the OG pants are the og pants are a little bit more buttery kind of like not exactly like the Lula line pants but like similar to those and these are more like a spandex material same one the other balance leggings I have those are those are also assembly and so they're a little bit more spandexy made better for like active wear or like cardio and stuff like that but I really like both of these colors I thought it was funny that I got pink like both like I mean these are more like coral but I got two pairs of pink leggings and I like don't have any pink leggings so I think it's funny that they're both like thank you for like at least like not normal black and you know the dark colors that are normally wear for leggings but yeah I really like these I think that I'm gonna get also these are a size medium as well I think I'm gonna get a lot of use out of both of these just because I have been working out a lot recently if you guys watch the earlier part of this video where I was working out yeah I will definitely link both of these down below if I can remember them
