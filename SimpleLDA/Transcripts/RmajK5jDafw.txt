 I love better quarantine they out I'm going to the back again  welcome to the bank deposits and as you can see I have my mask on my chin because I rather just walk without it cause it's easier to breathe then when I get into a venue up at the mascot and obviously have my gloves this that I hate that people are still slobs look at a glove on the floor trash here like just because we are running inside or trying to protect ourselves from this freaking virus me and we continue to harm the earth like it's so gross if we can't clean the earth you're gonna clean your house so ridiculous well humans are gross another one  Oh Oh Lord the bank was packed gotta wear this there's a lot of people are out today so right now I'm going to walk to a gas station to grab a few little tidbits and then take a nice little stroll and our little park over here but it is hot so thing why did I wear this jacket  the Sun isn't supposed to say I haven't thought outside enough to even check the weather and you could even see my skin is so bright where's my tan where's my glove who has my tan where's my brown skin Thanks I walk into this        I've been driving myself a little pero with this whole thing that has been going on and um obviously because I've been stay at home a lot more than coming out if you trying to grab like fresh air and stuff I've been like stabilizing myself in the house which isn't totally healthy I figured why not just come aside like a little bank anyway just go to the bank and take a nice walk back home through the park and I swear to you I feel shows done right now it's flippin amazing like I used to always like just hang out over here just watch the streams go you know what we're gonna do that right now  so maestro beautiful I'm happy that it's like really nice outside today because I wouldn't have gone out and I'm happy that I had at least I had a task at hand to do in order to Klout Lana wait wait so the nice little walk I took I do miss like hanging out apart by the river and we just relaxed and so I'm gonna try to do that more often the rest of the month this whole soft isolation quarantine Fiasco that were there we seem to be in has emotionally has been rocky for me a little bit just like the whole overload of keeping track of the news and everything was took a lot of a lot of my energy so I've been limiting that for the past few weeks what's in the blue like let's say maybe at the end of the week I'll listen to the tailings and NPR but for the remainder of the week I wouldn't even like listen to any news information whatsoever nor would I even read it if I'm curious enough I'll scroll through like the pages I follow on social media to check in with what's going on but the overload of the coronavirus is just too much it's like just let us know when were able to go back to somewhat of a regular life and then I'll be all about you know keeping track of the news or at least let us know man there's a vaccine that we can take in order for us to not catch it in order for us to keep all our immune systems kind of on par and then we could deal with it then well I'm just happy I'm healthy and my family is healthy although the virus hasn't affected myself nor any one of my family need I rectally I had to have friends who were affected by it and I just want to keep them in pairs so I'm trying to keep a positive outlook for them and for their family members who are who have dealt with it and are dealing with it I know exactly how it feels to be in those dark dark unknown spaces mentally and externally the one of the good things about this so I'll have to say is that the world is sort of feeling this at the same time where I'm hoping all the people if they allow themselves tap into their empathy and really really exercise their empathy muscles to understand that it's not an isolated incident it's a global one it's not a personal incident it's a global one and the wall needs a global heartbeat right now you know just send my prayers out to everyone and I hope you all I stay as safe as possible wear your masks wear your gloves wash your hands you know sanitize yourself your family your environment and just a safe yeah do what you can mentally and physically spread love honestly spread love and encouragement and strength and power that's the only way we could truly get back past this without everyone breaking down bye
