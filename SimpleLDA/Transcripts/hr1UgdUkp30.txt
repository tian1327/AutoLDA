 hey what's up guys this is your girl ebony and welcome to my channel as you can see from the title i am taking a trip in the middle of a quarantine pandemic lockdown coming from new york city yeah i know i don't know i don't know what i'm thinking either but i am headed to la where i'm from and um i'm just going to be with my family new york is completely shut down ain't nothing going on my job is on silent um and so until they call me back i'll be with my folks at least in the sunshine because it's raining today um it's super super early and um it's not even the sun hasn't even come up yet and um i'm just waiting for my car service to get here um i'm about to get super geared up you know with my mask and my my gloves on and stuff like that because i got to be super careful out here because i can't bring the coronavirus to la when they waiting on me just become healthy i can't come over there bringing and stuff like that so i'm kind of nervous um i don't know what this airport is going to be like i don't know if i was supposed to leave four hours early or 30 minutes like if it's gonna be nobody absolutely nobody or is it gonna be like super super pac like uh crazy lines and stuff like that but i did project my um my flight or whatever so i'm ready to go where to get the oops i'm ready to get out of here and um i see my family i'm excited i haven't been back to california since september it's may 1st so i'm excited to see my mom and um all the rest of my family if i get to see them i wonder i wonder if they don't want to see me or can they see me during this time like i would oh you want to still see me like i get it but yeah so i'm gonna catch y'all at the airport and um it's 7 a.m at jfk this is by far the craziest i've ever seen literally literally nobody in the airport it's wild it literally took me two minutes to get to check in through security check there's nobody the planes are grounded there's no planes going out that i've seen even on the drive up there's there's everything is closed there's nothing nothing going on in this airport and this is jetblue this is a really big terminal inside of jfk so i mean just look there's there's nothing these are all crew members these are not people that are sitting down waiting for flights these are people that are working just you know waiting to service people the wildest i've ever seen in the airport especially jay okay this is one of probably the biggest international airports in the country i mean nobody's going any where nobody's going nowhere this is wild okay so now i've found my terminal which wasn't that hard to do because i am convinced this fight that i'm on is the only flight that's leaving out of jfk because i don't see anybody sitting on any other um gates um maybe one other across the way there's two flights and i was kind of hoping that this flight was gonna be very empty maybe i could lay out on some get some sleep type because i didn't sleep at all last night at all but it's looking like it's going to be full all these people trying to go to la um one thing's for sure is they're really strict on the like six feet step behind even though there was nobody in um the security thing the six people there was it was definitely keep your distance and of course me i'm been stuck in the house for the last month so i'm just oh hi everybody and they're like man please six feet back please and i'm like oh i have on two masks i wasn't playing no games because these little masks don't be doing nothing but i thought i was going to suffocate but i'm fine um this is a great shock like a great shock i just would never ever not even a million years imagine that the airport would look abandoned um i left i was like six 6 15 and it's barely hitting seven and i went through security i've done my bag check the whole nine and i'm still here with my time to waste i'm curious i'm curious how long this is going to last because they're talking about retail companies being hit and all this stuff like that yo these airlines they're going through the blues i can tell planes lined up like cars outside like it's a car show it's it's who won a jet who who who needs a plane today okay can y'all afford one of these can y'all buy one of these we need to sell these we need some money if they they're lined up it's a trip i i just this is crazy um nobody ain't nobody here security dogs people with their dogs no i'm gonna check back in with y'all and see if i can get you know a little tooth for one i can stretch out a little bit do a little nothing get a little sleep on this plane um i'm at the little bar area because the people that are here for i guess the la flight are really sprawled out on some like obnoxious that i can't even sit down it's like every fourth seat there's a person so of course you don't want to sit next to a person so now i got to sit on these uncomfortable wooden ass chairs or whatever i'm all i'm excited i'm ready to go home hopefully this is a smooth little flight nothing crazy and i can do that  i just landed in lax and i've been having this face mask on for the last five hours fell asleep with it on woke up probably like an hour before the flight landed and was like in so much pain on my nose like it's terrible lax is just like jfk there is absolutely nobody here it's 11 o'clock in the afternoon or in the morning still here but there ain't nobody really really here and this is 11 o'clock so you would think it would be people are up ready to go kinda got my bags i'm waiting for my pups to come pick me up i'm still tired as hell though i know um and the weather is the weather i mean it's la i wish i can get you guys a better review but i am underneath a little underpass right now so it's not really giving me no leeway to kind of step out and show you anything but um i'm here welcome home ebony you're here i'm about to get him to take me to target though you know when you travel you forget things you need things like i can just buy those so before i get back to social dissidencing in my home in california i need my essentials for my home because i don't live here but i know he's taking forever on the freeway because i called him and he's like i'm on the freeway and i'm like you're on the freeway i told you what time i you know land but that's typical fashion for my pops to be late or slow driving yeah well they talking about some stuff i don't know if you watch the briefings i try to at least get the briefings once twice once once a day at least just to see what's going on in other states because i don't always get to catch cuomo but i hear what other states are talking about too they have something in the works that they trying to fast track that supposedly been doing really good i don't know and i don't give a damn everybody's like i'm not gonna get a vaccine i'm not gonna get a vaccine y'all better pump me with a damn vaccine yeah me too because guess what i'm not about to take no chance this is killing people on a on a and i don't care if they just old people it's not just old people that's dying or people in these they yeah they got compromised immune systems and stuff like that but why do i want to just be on the strength of i don't want no vaccines look i'm not going to be the first one to get the vaccines so i'm about to see if the other folk is going to die i'm not going to be the first one to get the vaccine i know it's not gonna reach my in the bronx first so we're gonna see how what's gonna happen well you're gonna know because they're giving it to the people that sing they're giving it to them now yeah and they saying hey they saying that they you know instead of like recovering like in 15 and 20 days they doing it like in nine days when they take this medicine see so hey it's working lord have mercy like this is the last thing we need but it needs to be like something where it's like vaccines vaccinated where we just don't have to walk around with these mass no more we can actually be in a concert well guess what i think it's going to take about a year yeah well for something like that i don't even know what this man name is but he was saying something like i'll give it a year yeah but it was you know obviously it started in january so from january january yeah takes time people are like what happened why are we gonna no who is ever ready for a pandemic nobody's ready for an outbreak nobody's ready for the potential of the end of the world like no there is nothing that we can do but wait and see because ain't none of us doctors ain't none of us researchers don't none of us know what we're doing so all we're doing is waiting on them to try to figure out and and come together and see what they can do exactly it out or something like that no i i'll take i'll be in the house i ain't nobody worried about rent ain't nobody worried about none of that kind of stuff right now can you imagine vegas i know you know what i'm talking about if they open up she was talking about going to vegas this is what i have to deal with if you're going to if you're going to the store you know how many people goes to the store you come home you haven't called anything that is not vegas traffic vegas the strip the people the casinos the clubs the bars the stores the shopping they're gonna do they six feet distance andrew you can't do six feet when there's 30 000 people there not when you're out there walking not when you're out there walking but when they come down to like going into the hotel and all that they're gonna they're gonna have six feet oh y'all just can't sit home huh it's just killing y'all actually you know what it's killing it's killing you guys vegas will be there let's just make sure you know cause y'all young but y'all not young we young but we're not young so i can't have y'all out there being susceptible you you you're not technically a senior citizen but it's getting patrol on the borderline you you really got to just choose your outings wisely i don't think vegas might be the thing let's start with bj let me tell you something vegas said  they say hey you can go over there in that little area and do this and that you're gonna go just to be in vegas exactly oh i mean i get it i understand i understand it's not it's not and it's we're ready we're tired we're restless we're all going through different things and y'all love vegas i can't imagine y'all giving it up because a pandemic is killing everybody uh i made it to target but now i'm like i need to get a couple things because i left like my face wash and body lotion and everything at home how silly of me i just i just don't know why i am drawn to off-brand like why buy sane eyes when i can buy up and up why buy neutrogena when i come back up and up it's the same to me so i don't really see a difference but maybe i should start using some good stuff because i'm trying to see a difference in my skin see if my hand can do something a little better than what i do get a natural glow i don't got no makeup on but you know when it all starts to come together um do that oh what did i like them this is old school super i don't even know should i still be using this type of like is this the type of that like dries your skin out i don't know i need like a real regular routine not like a routine that's going to cost me a fortune but just a regular girl this is all you need these two this works so if you guys got any suggestions on that please comment below and let me know because i need something asap for my skin i just um i'm in my happy place right now i'm in target and i'm just i'm at this point i'm looking for to buy i'm like what can i buy i really don't need nothing but i'm not doing that we're just oh gonna oh okay hmm

like mine's okay we're gonna do we're gonna do that i need a little little pumice stone or something for the feet and i got some hair that i need to dye and i ain't never in my entire life box dye i'm definitely mixologist when it comes to my hair dye but what's this doing hmm maybe not let's hold off on that because i gotta i gotta keep the hair and see what the hell is going on but target is definitely a way to spend all your money on you never ever needed  that you thought you wanted i came in here honestly for some brow stuff because i left i thought i packed some brow stuff on my last trip and the pin that i've been using just is not working for me any longer i need some  any more color my brow that's just that and what's for the low what's for the low okay and when i say the low i
