 over in the dog  Scot  good morning everyone and welcome back to my channel my name is rene for those of you guys that are new hello and welcome to our channel today today is gonna be a really special video we are we showing you guys my new New York City apartment I officially unmov'd n I do have a lot of things left to do but I can't really do them right now as you guys probably already know we are on lockdown and I've just been staying inside my apartment and you know doing a lot of computer work and stuff like that but it's not the official apartment tour but it is like more of an empty / moving-in apartment tour um I did film a little bit of my apartment when it was completely empty so I will show you guys that right now there's the apartment so this is from the front door on the side here it's just like a closet with like storage space and then washer and dryer I'm going to in this because it's gonna beep I was doing laundry and then here is the apartment so yeah that's my kitchen it's really nice like really modern and sleek I really like it this is actually my fridge which I really like this is the fridge that's the freezer I don't know why but this is like something I'm completely obsessed with they're like little like pantry drawers and then like you can push it and it does that little thing that like it'll like pop it into place I don't know I've never had that but I know it's like a huge thing in kitchens and just the simple things that make me happy I got a gas stove this is actually the dishwasher I like when I see like kitchens like that where there's like little nooks and crannies that look like part of the kitchen but it's actually like you know the fridge the pantry and then like the dishwasher it's pretty cool but there's a lot of storage up here I have a lot of space excuse the mess right now because I'm trying to film this before the movers come in like five seconds I got this curtain from Target last night and then the inside I really like they put like the grey here literally along the whole entire back Fareham it's pretty amazing and really cool have a little sink here not much space here but we'll work with it and then this is like my living area if you will this is the view it's not amazing and then when you turn here it's kind of like an alcove so it just goes into the living space you guys look at these windows like I can it's just windows everything and those ceilings are so high it's just amazing so I have all this space to play with oh yeah that's that's the apartment I'll show you guys one more clip of the view you guys are all so sad that I was gonna miss my water view which I'm gonna miss a lot but this is actually more my style if you guys can see that building right there that's actually the Empire State Building this city is actually kind of quiet right now because of the whole corona thing but usually there's like lots of hustle and bustle down there but yeah and then my wristband here it's actually the morning right now so it's really kind of quiet and peaceful looking and I'll show you guys like a clip of what it looks like at night okay let me show you guys like my little teeny-weeny closet I like how I have like storage space up here too so I think I'm gonna give Noah like one side and then I'll get the other side that's the apartment I've been here for a few days now and I have already unpacked everything not everything has a place yet but all the boxes are gone which is like my big thing I hate like being unsettled I am very much still unsettled that it's better than having boxes everywhere and not knowing where all my stuff is so I'm gonna do a quick walkthrough real quick of kind of an idea of what I want my apartment to end up looking like if you guys have any ideas definitely pop them in the description box but I'm excited to be able to play around with this space and you know make it more of a home eventually when this is all done so originally I really wanted to do a move-in vlog where I would like the unpacking with you guys and you know vlogging that experience but you know with everything I just kind of wanted to get off the electronics and get off work and all that stuff in yeah so this is what it's looking like as of right now there is stuff everywhere again this is just kind of how I'm living right now but it's a mess but it's an organized mess like I know what piles are what and I've done the best that I could with what I can do right now so keep that in mind but I'll show you guys what I plan on doing to the apartment I plan in this hallway to have some sort of like piece here that acts is also a storage because I've been just like lacking on storage the closet is looking more and more organized this one is where I'm having a little bit of a hard time so I really want to put a couch here but I don't want to block the view and I don't want to look at my kitchen so what I'm thinking is I would mount a TV somewhere over here and then put the couch here and acts as almost like a divider for the room and face that way I don't know help help me out bathroom is looking better I have this kind of as organized as it can get and then that one does not open and then I have this little drawer down here which again I've organized the best that I can kitchen is also organized believe it or not like I have everything in my cabinets as organized as they can get but basically everything is all set there I'm not going to go through everything but so far this is what we're working with and this space I want to do a circular table with two really like nice chairs that we can eat here this is what I have so far on my wall I have my TV and my fireplace here and I'm actually really liking the setup I don't think I'm gonna do anything different I think over here is where I'm gonna put a desk I want to find like some like really small corner desk where I can get my work done and kind of just have this view I really don't want to put anything here because I really hate blocking the view but I need somewhere to put this a giant computer so that's what we're working with I actually have a tempurpedic bed now that's to come I'm actually doing a sponsor with them in the future it was supposed to be for this video but with everything going on it's just like a lot so we've put a hold on that but we're definitely gonna get that rollin soon it's the best bed I can tell you guys like it's unreal there's like a remote for it it goes up like we're gonna talk about that in the near future but the best bet I've ever ever experienced so I have that all set and the base is the Ergo base so it looks like I have a bed but I I want to get like a bed frame in like an actual bed that's not staying there but that's just there for right now I want to get to smaller and again I want them to have some sort of storage benefit because I don't really want to put anything under my bed I hear that's like really bad luck so we're like bad energy so I'm trying not to do that and yeah that's pretty much what I have planned for this little apartment so I like I've done like a complete 180 there's a lot of change happening right now not just for me but for a lot of people that I know personally and it's just a really weird weird time right now but I have a lot of really fun plans being in New York City I definitely want to like get out of my comfort zone and get out of my bubble so far I've been loving it I haven't been out much because self-isolation but the view is really cool the views like amazing I am just an AW every single morning night day like it's just really nice but I haven't had a chance to really walk around and you know look around my little neighborhood yet hopefully we can do that in the near future I have hope that we can it's just been a very slow adjustment just because of everything that's been going on in my life and in the world I feel like I'm able to kind of get to know my apartment a little bit because I have to stay in here and I am alone you know the positive and this is that I can kind of ease into this lifestyle rather than just getting thrown in the midst of it and then you know how New York is just very hustle-bustle so it's nice to kind of slowly ease my way into it and not just kind of get thrown into that straight away so yeah that's my new apartment I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did definitely give it a thumbs up I love you guys so much and I'll see you guys all in a future video bye guys
