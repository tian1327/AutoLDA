 good morning guys today I am here on this lovely at Friday 10:00 a.m. morning filming a morning routine for you guys vlog style because I find those a lot of fun to watch and I thought why not film one currently I just woke up very recently like 30 minutes ago I just spent some time flying in the Sun out of my window because it's super pretty and super nice and like I just love nice sunny spring days I will now be headed to take a shower and fix this thing right here  now this is my outfit for today even though yes I know I'm staying home but that does not stop me from dressing up this is a top from Primark which is a store in England so I bought it while I was there and then these are pants from H&M my stupor cartoon well I think and they're like he's typical like business great pants actually I got inspired by my friend Diana who runs letting me borrow pants that were kind of like this the material it's like very nice and they're super pretty no usually I do my makeup in my hair before I eat breakfast if I were to like actually go somewhere but I think right now I'm actually gonna make breakfast first because I have my dad and my sister mine to cook for as well and they're already enough anyway so let's head down to the kitchen shall we  good morning this is my sister who refuses to show her face but that is okay what are you making yourself for breakfast she is making it herself smoothie some avocados what am I gonna have for breakfast I don't know dad ask him to make him an egg um they're going to be searching at the fridge for some what all right yeah we have pancakes leftover from yesterday you're so lovable you have a sandwich that I make myself for lunch like yesterday and I didn't eat it so yogurt oh my god guys this is such a good yogurt Aussie Greek plain is I get the best yogurt ever so definitely try it um what else ooh so this has been my recent obsession lately is this Tazo chai tea concentrate to make lattes chai tea lattes  I cannot open this oh I thought because I didn't see you having I thought we just ran out on you throw away joke's on you I'm using this almond oh  so good chai tea lattes for less huh I was like I'm gonna make myself scrambled eggs and then I opened there's only one egg left to quarantine to life with one egg just kidding plenty of other home to me I could easily just heat up this breakfast sandwich for myself should I do it should I not should I do it Evelina should I not yeah these are very good English muffin breakfast sandwiches from Costco and I really craving one right okay I'm doing it I have one of these yesterday and they were so good so that's what I'm gonna have today because I am so lazy so I'm nutrition at its finest to my right  yes I eat my breakfast up in my room because this is our peace and quiet exists but before I eat I'm gonna make my bed because it looks a little rough at the moment and my room is to look kind of presentable so now that Angelina has made her bed she'll be trying to do some productive work while eating her breakfast I think now all the schools are currently closed and that includes high schools and the senior in high school it really sucks because if schools get lose all the way till September and of next year that means that seniors will just never get to go to school again and that kind of sucks and it's kind of a little bit sad but it's okay and unfortunately teachers are also not doing the most amazing job and my district not like assignments and stuff which I get because they also have kids who are off of school and who are in different districts with different online learning systems so it's been very difficult because of that they do try their best though and they send emails and they post you know like review materials and stuff like that it also just really sucks because as part of the flow IB Diploma we have our IB exams in May technically supposed to have them in May currently no one knows what exactly is going on with exams whether or not we're gonna have them what the deal is with them but we do need to keep studying I guess this is just our main priority right now so it doesn't really matter that we don't have assignments as long as we are doing independent studying I do have English assignments and to complete though and that is my goal for today as of the entirety of the day not necessarily right now but usually in the mornings I do it check my school email or any updates yesterday I had my French oral which was online through zoom comm it actually went quiet well except for some logging here in there but glad that we still are able to do things like this online usually in my mornings I've also been doing some editing because I now have more time to film for you guys I'm just going to finish my breakfast  I'm obviously very slow eating my breakfast I've been doing some updates for my Instagram stories like these and also some polls and questions to ask you guys so please make sure to follow my Instagram to keep yourself updated on my life and also on some new projects or videos that I like coming out with after I am done with this delicious of breakfast and chai tea latte I'm gonna go and do my makeup in hair so I can go outside and take a walk and maybe get some nice photos in because the weather is absolutely beautiful and it just makes me so happy even though all of us are quarantined and a lot of us aren't complaining and sad that we can't do anything in life is miserable I think that it's very nice and it's somewhat of a gift for those of us who are in a great place with a roof over our head and abilities to work from home and I'll you know a house and food this is a great time for us to just reflect on ourselves and the world and go outside breathe some fresh air so I put on a cardigan because I'm freezing right now anyways I'm here to fix this beauty right here you're probably asking why are you gonna try and get yourself all looking more presentable if you're setting at home well for myself because what I like clean up myself and do my hair and makeup it just makes me feel like brighter and I'd be more productive throughout my day and I have the time why not you know the very first thing that I'm gonna do is fix my hair I washed it I think three days ago it's like okay I generally don't really do anything with my hair especially lately it's just annoying because when I straighten it it doesn't hold the straightness unless I just don't put up in tiny details for braids or whatnot but overall it's fine no see I brushed it and it already looks better you don't know if I should do anything else with it it's a good question what do you think I think it looks good if you like it is at this point and it's like time that it doesn't move anything right now looking quite nice and fresh okay ever since I've gotten my eyebrows dyed with henna they've been like pretty good and keeping their shape and stuff like they're generally not bad right now I'm still like to brush them out with a nice spoon brush because that's just the way it be now I'm thinking if I want to be extra thumb eye shadow okay so this is my favorite um makeup palette that I have my eye shadow palette and while I was that um you taught at my dance comp I was kind of not very smart and I dropped it and my favorite eyeshadow tints they just cracked and look at these I was at least so heartbroken and you guys have tips on how to fix this and how to like compress it again um please do tell because I don't know what to do with this and it's like not workable a good thing these are all fine but like these two are my most used ones are my favorite ones and they are now non-existent so that's fun so we have definitely done the summit sort of eye shadow look and now I'm gonna put on some lipstick and today's how to do a little nude color because my mom bought this awesome like the lipstick set for me of like a bunch of different ones and they aren't long-lasting but they are very pretty and they smell super nice it's winter where it's like a daily just a regular day out or I'm just trying to look a little bit more possessed for something I use these but definitely not for comps these are not good for comps at all because they just come off so I am done with that now the last accessory I would put on my glasses and when I'm at home or I'm not really going out somewhere fancy I really like to wear my glasses instead of my contacts because they kind of add on to my total look anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this morning routine of mine I am right now gonna go outside on a walk because the weather is amazing and I have an amazing neighborhood that I can walk around and super happy to do that I hope you guys stay safe and enjoy your days at home as well do something productive with yourself take care of yourself make yourself feel good organize your life and as always see my next video bye
