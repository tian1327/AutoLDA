 it is a ghost town in here yep traveling on a Saturday and there's literally not a single other person in here good morning you guys it is the day of the event and I am so excited so for any of you guys that are new to our channel or missed our vlog from yesterday I am actually up here in Las Vegas yes again a lot of you guys may know that I was actually in Las Vegas just us last weekend to go boating but that was an amazing time guys not seen that video definitely go check it out but I am here again because of a work event with my company Adventure hunt so as you can see I'm all decked out got the t-shirt on got the hat on and I got the treasure chest all packed up and ready to go that little thing you guys I have honestly forgotten maybe five or six times throughout this trip nice to usually cannot wait she gave it to the winners of today's event because I don't have to worry about anymore I'm super excited for this event though you guys because it is going to be technically our second social distancing competition that we have going on and we're gonna make sure that they're staying safe staying healthy and having fun so I got to be over there actually in just a few minutes but beforehand I'm gonna clean up around here real quick just make sure I didn't forget anything have you guys ever forgotten anything I had a hotel room it's seriously the worst I feel like every single time before I leave a hotel room I always just scour it to make sure that I didn't leave anything behind and I don't become so unlike this who forgets their pair of shorts gosh that's so weird still mm-hmm anyways I'm gonna take one last look around the hotel room get some breakfast take an uber head on over to the event now I won't be able to vlog too much during the event maybe not even at all but I will be sure to capture the journey of me flying back home because it is going to be a Saturday a Saturday is usually a very busy day for travel so I'm actually interested to see what travel is now I'm going to be like on a Saturday are you guys I love you but I gotta run so I will see you in a little bit boom we just finished everyone and it was seriously awesome the event could have not have gone better seriously we had so much fun so this event you guys was for a group of summer sales man and summer salesmen as you guys know there's the type of people that are used to rejection they're used to just being pushed outside our comfort zone and this event you guys push them even further we had so much fun we laughed so hard we had him do the craziest funniest challenges all of them that were social distancing by the way and it was just so so funny we took him all over Las Vegas so they would start here at the Luxor then they ran over to Excalibur and then from there to the Statue of Liberty then the Brooklyn Bridge then the giant Golden Lion out in front of MGM Grand and then from there they went to the Tropicana before coming right back to the starting line because the starting line was actually the finish line as well I am standing in front of the Luxor Tower I thought that this would be a great place for them to finish because there is so much shade right here and it was a great way for us to be able to congratulate them they can hang out the shade of rest because it's so hot out and then we thanked him for an amazing event and let them on their way guys it was seriously it's so much fun but now it is time for me to board my flight head on back home and meet up with Rick   alright guys I am back at the airport and as you can see it is a ghost town in here yep traveling on a Saturday and there's literally not a single other person in here that is crazy they got workers out so obviously you know this is an open terminal but yeah it's crazy to see that there is no one at all in any of the lines no one's sitting on any of the benches over here I'm just seriously like by myself in this Airport that is crazy  I am standing in front of the security line literally no on and I am also TSA PreCheck guess that doesn't really do much good one of you're the only person in the line  whoa guys I got busted for having a water in with the back of my backpack I have no idea how I forgot that thing how often do you guys forget stuff for your luggage and then when you go through security it's like oh my gosh how did I forget that this is hilarious I am literally the only person here I mean look at this there's no one there is no one here I have not seen a single other person in this entire airport   yep still have yet to see into anyone else traveling in this Airport look at this there is no one here this is just nuts right now we need to look behind me do you guys see anyone at all this is so eerie it feels like the airport's closed and I'm the only person blind today okay so I just got to the top of the escalator just to prove a point still no one no one this this is crazy there's no one here look back this way no one this way  there is still no one here it is crazy how empty this Airport is I am actually at my gate right now and there is no one here I don't know if I'm gonna have the entire plane to myself or not I'm gonna still think that I'm not going to just because San Francisco is such a huge Airport and such a big destination for connecting flights which mine is but I am still shocked but I have not seen anyone yet it is crazy to see though none of these jet ways are being used I mean the airport is literally completely empty hi guys just decided to sit down get something to eat but more people are starting to show up I'm guessing they're all gonna be on my flight only because there are no other planes on the jetways all right guys I got myself a nice veggie sandwich trying to be a little healthier and I got this weird drink I have no idea what its gonna taste like but she said a lot of people ordered those and they taste good so I'm gonna give it a shot okay this sandwich is absolutely delicious if you guys are ever happen to be terminal three definitely come check out port of subs these subs are delicious all right now it's time to try this bad boy out a little nervous oh holy cow that's got a kick but it was good I'm gonna have to get this one get back home I'm you guys ever tasted something like this before seriously it's amazing this business right here just closed the doors and I asked the lady how come you guys are closing your doors it's only like 2 o'clock and she was saying we're the only flight out of this entire terminal today so that's kind of crazy to think that she was basically just staying open until we left  well guys I am officially home feels good to be back my flight had about a dozen people on it but now it's time to go meet up with Britt she has had a quite the interesting day and I hope like crazy she brought Finn come on excited see a little pop tail there's Britt oh is that my uber oh thank you I need that guys it feels good to be back apparently not long enough for some people oh my god did you see that reaction you guys don't know that's definitely Brittany's thing I always have to shower do all my laundry we take burn all my clothes directly the washer yep your shower we're going to I saw your bag yep yeah we're not messing around here that's for sure I'm still not getting a kiss man around the airport Security's coming we gotta go but I would need in alright guys we just got home I got all showered up and changed into a brand-new pair of clothes that way I'm smelling good and I can get that kiss from Brit Brit by the way you guys had the craziest day and we want to tell all of you guys about it but it's still going on like the craziness has not stopped and so once we find out all the details
