 all right what do you think do I look like the part as approached when do I look like a protestor cuz I'm gonna go holy I'm doing this you know it's first time I don't know if you saw my previous video earlier about this feeling the the hesitancy the fear and just never ever doing something like this and I feel like you know what I wanna I want to be a part of this movement right gotta be part of something gotta stand for something got a kind of do something more than just yourself right for yourself we gotta do it for the greater good of humanity to create a good of our fellow citizens and just be there to support you know solidarity unity and all that stuff so yeah I'm going to try my best to document as much as possible I'm gonna have this video camera attached to my chest I got when it was like chest mount got my video camera well it's on my seat I got my video camera and hope for the best I hope to god I do not get gassed well hope to god we don't get gassed you know beat and all that so I don't plan on staying for a long time cuz I got other work to finish I basically saw my patient and just went melee home about the dog and then just go so all right man let's do this alright I just finished my first ever protest and say the least I was actually very fun and now it's actually very interesting and all the stuff you see on TV like the rioting eluding the breaking of window stuff I mean granted and dogs happened but I mean for the majority of the time that was far from the case as far as that experience that I had today like it was it was nice to say that for once it felt like we came we all came together as humanity I didn't matter what race what background whether you were rich you were poor you were homeless people just treated each other like human beings and that was something that just to say leagues again I have not seen that before right people are canning out water bottles people giving out food people are just helping each other out and just overall being nice to each other there are people there who had like they set up like these little like tans with like this food heading him up just pee protesters people walk around annek Clif Bar energy bars just giving at the homeless people just it did it it was just nice to see that and it's a solidarity the unity of all of that was just a unique experience that I feel like you know what the next time they happen or they have one again I feel like I should go and get a beautiful thing about this is you get a lot of exercises because you do a lot of walking you're not too stationary in one area you go from row one city one aspect of a city to the other side of a city and you just walk you're on blocks it's holding up sign just protesting right black lives matter you know one race and and all that good stuff and so I highly suggest if you guys have never done it before you guys are like a fray like I don't know if I should protest I'm afraid of getting injured getting sick and or whatever I mean the sickness part is still a real deal so make sure you still wear your face mask but as far as the real danger behind it I didn't really see any everyone there was very cordial they were very respectful no one was littering surprisingly people were actually throwing the trash away in the trash cans and just people were just marching calmly safely and securely we even had people on the streets or people in the car like honking and cheering supporting the cause and so all the stuff again that you see on TV just understand and news media is always gonna show the negative sides of any event because that's what sells negativity sells drama sells trauma sells like all of that stuff and so find a local protesting area near you and just support a good cause because this is what we're all fighting for we're all fighting for equal rights for one between black people and pretty much just everyone else right equality for everybody as well as just to minimize the amount of police brutality that we just see pretty much all over the place right and so that's what we're fighting for we're fighting for a good cause so all right Cheers
