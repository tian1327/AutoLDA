  good morning guys welcome back it's every day may day 21. i can't believe it i woke up early this morning i got a quick workout in and then i just showered i have just like kind of a random list of things i need to do today and i know i got a couple requests for from people to do longer vlogs so i'm gonna attempt to make this vlog as long as possible so let me know what you guys prefer if you guys prefer longer vlogs like this one or if you want to see more like shortened more edited videos let me know i'm just quickly doing a skincare routine but i have a new product that i want to test out because i'm going to go out and about this morning and i actually haven't been wearing spf which i know is bad when i go outside so should probably work on that i have this glossier invisible shield daily sunscreen that they sent me a little while ago i haven't tried it yet this is spf 35 i think this is a chemical sunscreen but i'm not positive yet i need to do more research on um chemical versus mineral sunscreens but from what i gathered mineral sunscreens are usually better from a lot of people's opinions a lot of like skincare people's opinions but a lot of people say that like with darker skin tones they say that the chemical sunscreens don't leave a white cast correct me if i'm wrong i need to do more research my skin tone isn't that dark and i clearly don't have a tan because i haven't been able to you know i mean it's only may but i haven't really been outside a lot i'm pretty pale right now so um yeah hopefully it won't be too bad but yeah i've been watching a lot of like chloe ting workout videos or work out like transformation videos and it's kind of inspiring me to just get my butt into shape um i don't know what this summer is gonna be like because who knows if we'll even be able to do anything this summer but you know i've always loved chloe ting's workouts i've had her workouts saved for like three or four years now so i've been watching her stuff for a while but i actually think it's really cool how everyone's you know doing her two-week program and watching her those videos it's like crack they're so addicting and once you watch one youtube recommends you all of them but yeah i think i don't know if i'm gonna get to film a video today because i have a lot of like like i said i have a lot of random things to do with today but i'm gonna also try to get another video in i'm not gonna apply this just yet i'll probably apply this a little later because i have some stuff i have to do in the apartment before i go out so i don't want to apply this now so that it kind of fades fades i don't know what the right word is but i want it to be applied like about 30 minutes before i leave so i'm just gonna bring this with me to my bedroom but i won't apply it just yet so yeah i'm just gonna figure out my hair and then hopefully it won't look too bad today also side note can you guys let me know in the comments what your favorite video from everyday may that i've done so far is because i don't know i kind of i feel like you guys have been liking all the videos which is really great and makes me very happy to see your comments but i also want to see like which ones were your favorites just so i get an idea of what you guys like the most and what you guys would want to see more of in the future during everyday may and even after every day may so yeah also i forgot to do my bed this morning i was just in such a rush to get a workout in because i knew that if i waited any longer to go and work out i'd kind of just chicken out and be like not shaken out but i'd be like never mind i'm going back to bed so i was like i'm not gonna do my bed i'm not gonna i'm just gonna go straight to the living room take out the yoga mat and work out  my hair is still pretty wet slash damp so i kind of just put this scarf situation and then tied it around a bun i look like an egg so i'm gonna make a quick protein smoothie and then after that i have to do the dishes um a couple days ago the dishwasher stopped working so we called maintenance and then they came to check it out and apparently like the computer part of the dishwasher just isn't working anymore so they have to replace it and they said that typically the replacements come in two weeks but considering the um pandemic uh it might take a little bit longer so we might go like about a month without a dishwasher which yes i know a lot of people don't have dishwashers in their apartments but for us first of all we're used to having a dishwasher so it kind of sucks because we're kind of downgrading and also we cook a lot like this whole situation is from last night only so yeah i basically just have to wash everything by hand again at the end of the day there are worse things in the world but it's kind of annoying you know i don't know what to eat i want to make matcha right but i don't want to dirty too much stuff and matcha and a smoothie is a little od so maybe i'll just make matcha with like eggs maybe i could add my matcha to the smoothie i'm going to i'm going on pinterest pinterest is such a lifesaver so matcha smoothie recipe okay in my attempt to make a matcha smoothie i don't know i'm basically going to take this banana which looks insane but it was getting really ripe so i tossed it in the fridge i don't think it's that ripe it just the fridge probably made the skin really brown so i have some frozen mango chunks i don't have much so i'm going to use that up and then the matcha powder some collagen and since i worked out this morning i think i'm going to use the serving size which is two scoops i usually when i make a matcha latte i usually only do one scoop but since this has 18 grams of protein if you do the serving size which is two scoops um that's what i'm gonna do instead of adding protein powder and then i have some almond milk and then water and we'll see usually when i do a mango tropical smoothie i add turmeric and or ginger powder but because i'm adding this i'm not sure if those flavors are going to work oh my god i don't want to waste the rest of my mangoes on a crap smoothie i really wish i had spinach but i don't i feel like that would just make this that much healthier guys i think i just did something honestly you barely taste the matcha the matcha isn't that strong i think i am going to add some turmeric because i think it would still taste really good turmeric has really good anti-inflammatory properties and it has a lot of health benefits and it tastes it complements like the mango and banana flavors really well that tastes amazing david dominique posted a new video where you'll get confused in french as an english speaker i love his french videos i'm gonna watch that while i answer a few emails i know that we still have a week and a half left of everyday may but i kind of already started planning out my next project because i just got really excited about it last night and i feel like it's gonna be fun it's not gonna be the same at all as every day may but i don't wanna get into it i don't wanna i'm not gonna spoil anything i just to say that i will continue to be making videos after every day may um i know like last year specifically last year and even the year before i went long long stretches of time between posting videos but i think every day may is really helping with kind of get my creativity flowing again and making me fall back in love with making videos and it's just so much fun i enjoy it so much but yeah let me watch this video get some work done and then i have to do those damn dishes i kind of changed my hair situation because it was not looking cute before i was looking back at the footage from earlier today i was like chloe oh my god why does her hair look so bad so i've been kind of doing laundry for the past couple hours i feel like i'm constantly either doing laundry or cleaning this apartment i guess it keeps me busy which is great but it's also really annoying i mean i've obviously been wearing a lot more clothes recently because i've been changing and wearing different things for the videos whereas last month i was wearing pretty much the same like three tops and three bottoms all week long i was kind of just rotating between them so yeah i guess being productive equals having a lot of laundry to do but it's no big deal my friend sylvie actually shared in our group chat um this new art not new artist but this artist that she found um that she thought we'd like and i really like him so i thought i'd share him with you his name is givian it's like gideon but without the d and with a v i've basically been listening to his music for the past hour and i really like it how do i describe his voice it's very like how did how did sarah say sarah my friend who's also in the group chat she said so deep and sultry in reference to his voice so yeah he has such a great voice i don't want to get copyrighted but i guess maybe i'll play a couple seconds yeah it's really good yeah so i've been listening to that i think i'm going to start uh curating my playlist for june i take my playlists very seriously and whenever i find new music i'm like i'm very careful not to overplay it for myself before i find a like a really good playlist and i think what i'm going to start doing is just a new playlist every month i typically do a new playlist every season more or less but i think i want to start doing it every month especially if we're going to be in quarantine for the next year i don't even know how long this is going to last so let me know if you guys enjoyed my last playlist video because then maybe i could do another one for my new one or i could just link my new playlists down below during in in my vlogs i guess once i'm done folding on my laundry i have a little bit of editing to do but once i'm done with all that i'm going to treat myself to a walk outside there's literally not a cloud in the sky look at that oh my god this is a really good one heartbreak anniversary i am 43 seconds in and i am loving this let me like it  also this isn't something that i've ever really shared because i don't do underwear hauls on my channel but um a little while ago arie was having a huge sale on like underwear bras panties that kind of stuff and i basically did a huge haul of like boy briefs like cheeky underwear like the bikini underwear basically the underwear that you wear when you're not wearing pants you know those super random topic but i feel like i mean i love getting recommendations for any type of clothing especially when it's like loungewear or underwear or bras so i thought maybe you guys would be interested i get i don't know yeah arie has some good stuff i think i'm gonna buy some more things from them  it's so beautiful outside i love it here  i have been outside for an hour that was amazing of course i forgot to put on my sunscreen which i was very excited to try out this morning but i was just so like i was itching to get outside so i just completely forgot to apply sunscreen i walked to gramercy park obviously you can't go in it's the park that you need a key for and only a few people in the world have the key but i walked the perimeter of gramercy park and it was just so serene it was so quiet even though it's right off of third avenue it's still somehow so quiet when you walk around there i don't know it's just such a special place i kept getting whiff of fresh because like the air in the city is i wouldn't call it fresh air unless you're in very specific parts or like central park or something but um i was like walking around the park i was just took a deep breath in and then you got a whiff of like fresh flowers but anyway so i did go to target as you probably saw i think i took a clip and i have the most random target haul ever so i got some boom chicka pop popcorn we needed a little something to snack on while we watched tv tonight i also got spinach which is going to be exclusively for um my smoothies i'm actually really excited for this this is the coconut aminos like so many people on youtube have been talking about this this is basically it says the original soy free alternative to soy sauce so i'm excited to test this out a lot of people say it tastes exactly like soy sauce since i finished up the um broccoli yesterday when i made dinner i decided to get some more i also got this silicone spatula we have one already but it's too flimsy and i like how like firm this one is and it'll be easier to you know break up food and scrape um food off the bottom of the pan and i also got some tide pods and then we also needed a swiffer duster because things are looking a little dusty i've been using those swiffer pads the like dry swiffer pads i've kind of just been using those to dust things and i felt like that was kind of a waste so i thought i'd get this i also got um these individual perrier it's not great for the environment but this is all they had and i really wanted some sparkling water just to like switch things up because all i've been having is just water recently cotton swabs some hair clips in my last vlog i showed you guys i got a toner from paula's choice and i haven't been able to use it yet because we didn't have any cotton rounds um and i didn't really know how else to use it i didn't want to use my fingers you know the nail salons aren't open so i thought i'd switch it up and get a new nail polish color this reminds me of the old sc color lilacism i used to love that nail polish and i have no idea what happened to it i probably threw it out and last but not least i got the cerave um facial moisturizing lotion broad spectrum spf 30. so i i still want to try out the glossier one but hiram the guy who i'm like watching all of his skincare videos on youtube i've talked about him a few times so far this month on my channel but this i think i think this is the one that he highly recommends but yeah he highly recommends cerave or sarah v i've been using this brand since i was in elementary school so i know this brand to be great and i love it and he highly recommends the you know spf version of this lotion so i'm excited to try this out because i do need like a good sunscreen so yeah that's basically it for the target haul now i need to sanitize everything and we need to figure out what we're going to have for dinner ugh i love 7 p.m everyone's cheering it's so nice the fact that they're still doing it though amazing you
