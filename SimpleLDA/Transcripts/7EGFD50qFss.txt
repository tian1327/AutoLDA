 JULE >> Hi, my name is Jule. I'm a second year PhD student studying computer science. My area of concentration is artificial
intelligence and this is my vlog. So today I'm gonna talk about what's been all our minds which is the coronavirus. So like everyone else,
it's affected me and my day-to-day life a lot. All the restaurants are closed, all
the bars are closed, the gyms, the library. My classes are all online now. I'm
actually working completely from home so I brought my computer home from the
office and set up a little workspace in the kitchen. My day-to-day life is a lot
different than it was before and I've had a lot of trouble adjusting to that.
I'm having trouble concentrating and focusing on work now that I'm not in the
office anymore and my usual coping strategies for when I can't focus or
aren't feeling well is to go to the gym or hang out with friends or go to a cafe
all of which are not options at the moment because of the coronavirus. So
it's been really hard for me to kind of know what to do when faced with these
situations. I've tried a few different things - so one I've been cooking. So I've been doing a recipe that kind of takes all day to
make and for the first time I'm actually home all day so I can actually make this
recipe so that's been fun. I also try to take breaks and do some push-ups or
jumping jacks to kind of keep me moving and hopefully help my focus. I've also
been taking random dance party breaks. So for about a couple minutes I'll stop put
on some music and have a little dance party. and then get back to work.
So that's been helping I've also been talking to friends on the phone. Our
friend group is actually doing a virtual game night tonight which should be
interesting. So I'm kind of curious how that's gonna
play out. However seeing people virtually is not the same as seeing someone in
person and I can tell I'm already starting to feel pretty isolated and
lonely. It's been really hard not seeing anyone everyday and not being able to
just go to a cafe and even see strangers. So I think this is gonna be a long
couple of months or more or less so that's the other thing that's been kind
of stressing me out is we have no idea how long this is gonna last or kind of
what its gonna turn into so a lot is up in the air and unknown which can be
pretty stressful though I'm trying to focus on things that I do know and that
I can control like my schedule and the things I do and not focus on things that
I can't control like how is the virus spreading externally to me and things
like that. So overall it's definitely going to be an adjustment but hopefully
we can all hang in there together and get through this.
