  hey guys Eid Mubarak to all those who celebrate Eid if you don't know what it is it's a Muslim holiday a little bit of history for context when the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him migrated to the city of Medina in Saudi Arabia she saw that the people in Medina were having carnivals and festivals on two specific days and he told them that God has granted Muslims two days to special and joyous days and these two holidays are evil Kippur and evil as her tomorrow is evil thicker and it's a joyous holiday for all Muslims because we are being thankful for our help wealth and family just because Ramadan is over and Eve is coming doesn't mean that we still can't be thankful and be closer to God we should still continue to do the things that we did during Ramadan like praying reading the Quran
