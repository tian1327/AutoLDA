Austin north - Austin is like three and a half four and a half hour flight sometimes myself the parent said if they're like 15 miles away so hopefully hopefully it will be downstairs by the time I get downstairs but they never did what she told them to do with the Kota quarantine birthday birthday 30th quality why does it look like everything's open around here guys it looks like the city isn't running full force here it looks like it mom with all this traffic Laura gas is cheap here gasping only a dollar fifty cody has his whole face stuck in that peanut butter jar so funny lord have mercy anyway it's cold here it's like 57 degrees that's chilly for Texas I thought it was really nice but anyway we're all home with my little brother's here and they're just my chill mom's taken brisket I got sweet potatoes in the oven and I'm outside of codeine because he's bored to death beam in that house so yeah I'm not sure what's gonna go on for the rest today but I wouldn't let you guys know and I'll get back to you guys later so she's stupid God does it yes yay Jim loved you from the first time you call me Leigh loved it from your Winston you winking games always on my mind always in my brain yeah with you this one became I'm in another nothing crazy you system person better side-by-side another normally syncing time is gonna fix the inside no nothing Oh Jennifer get in your way yeah yeah  I could being in when you're miles away you can make it shine the hole already is always on my mind always in my brain the days are long and the nights are a my son Oh  thinking Tommy's gonna fix me inside  and to forget it no nothing  make me forget and don't think I want to forget anyway yeah yeah no nothing's gonna make me forget get I don't think going to forget anyway yeah yeah
