 hey Here I am filming a YouTube video obviously um and I have not wanted to film a video in the amount of time that I haven't posted anything for like the past week I'm like you know I kinda film a video like I kind of just had that urge to like pick up the camera and film my day which doesn't make any sense to me because we're literally stuck in quarantine unable to do anything or go out and do anything exciting so I don't know what I'm trying to film but um I was like you know what let me just do it so how am i doing um the past couple months have been I would say subpar some days not so great some days okay but for the past couple days I've been feeling pretty decent so I just kind of wanted to take action and for some reason I had this little voice it's like why don't I film a video and I'm like okay so as you can see I chopped my hair off meaning I literally took scissors to my own hair like the first day quarantine and chopped it off it ended up being 11 inches so that's one thing that changed I'm home from school obviously we have like mmm three weeks left of online school and that's been fine and I actually haven't had a lot of assignments so it's really not that much to keep up with I feel for all my like science friends and stuff like that because I can't imagine doing like chemistry and stuff online so if you're in the science field I pray for you but at the same time it does suck even though I haven't really enjoyed school and I never really wanted to go at least coming out of the house three days a week and if I'm being honest um this social isolation quarantine thing isn't far off from how I normally live but at least I had the option to go out before and I didn't realize how much just going out to random places and wandering around affected my mental stability so so yeah I bet you're all feeling the same way how it's been a pretty tough just being stuck not able to do anything so I'm trying to make the most of it I'm trying to stay positive and just keep myself as busy as I can with meaningless tasks so I guess that's what today's video is gonna be about because there's nothing else I do so yeah today I started off waking up at 5:00 because that's how my internal insomnia alarm clock likes to wake me up and then after a little bit just sitting there I was like alright let me get some breakfast made some banana toast and had some coffee came back up here and I actually did fall back asleep which really never happened so now it's like 11:00 and um my to-do list of all my exciting things really just includes cleaning my room because you can't see it but it is disgusting and I want to paint something because I've been on a painting role trying to keep my creative juices flowing during this quarantine also I'm such a perfectionist that like the smallest canvas will take me many hours to finish so that just wastes my time and then I also want to work out so I haven't worked out in like a year like consistently maybe I've tried to do it work out here and there but like I am NOT the same fitness guru girl you guys all know like I am NOT that fit queen anymore it is actually sad how little stamina I have so during this quarantine I'm trying to take all the free time I have and force myself to do something active because you know we sit around all day so I will be trying to work out it will not be good but it'll be something I would say to get that summer bod but who knows we're gonna have a summer so yeah enough of me talking um I guess I'll clean my room I don't know how to transition this like it's literally not exciting um so this is what my room looks like that is a mess there's this on the floor that over their bathroom just as messy you know what I don't claim all this mess though because my mom is cleaning out a spare bedroom and she decided to put like all the extra stuff in my room so like that stuff is not mine but I'm still gonna have to clean it up anyway so  look how pretty it is today right and the birds are chirping alright y'all this is literally the funniest angle ever but the only place I could put my phone where I would stay up I'm on my way to Panera right now to pick up some food don't worry they bring it to your car it's still social distancing I'm not eating there anything but I'm just so tired of making my own food and tired of eating the same things all the time like it has become a chore I'm pretty sure we all feel that way just making food I just I can't be bothered half the time so I was like you know what I want something good I want something cold and refreshing which I didn't have anything cold to eat you know like a salad like I want a salad so I'm getting like a free summer salad or whatever from Panera I'm so excited like I'm so excited to have someone else prepare my food for me and know it's gonna be good you don't realize all the things the little things you take advantage of when they're closed and you're in quarantine you secured the bag and I'm eating my bread right now I'm so hungry a Panera Bread I could live solely off of this I realized I forgot to film my salad because I ate it so fast that it was just calling um but it was actually not as good as I expected so anyway I was just chilling outside with my neighbor distanced of course but we were just in lawn chairs chatting and whatever and then I had a virtual OBGYN appointment that's new I mean it was just like a chat for 10 minutes so it's not as crazy as it sounds but now I'm eating popcorn and children bed watching tic TOCs which I now realize I've been doing for probably well over an hour but why not I also have a tick tock it makes me very anxious posting on there for some reason I just feel like it's a very um they're just hurt and standard on tick tock you either have to be really funny or really pretty I don't feel like I'm on the end of either of those spectrums like I make up for each of them with each other you know plus I don't like the fact that these 16 year olds literally look like all models does not make me feel good about myself yeah so um go show my tick-tock some love because like I said it makes me very anxious supposed to go in there and I usually end up bleeding on with a lot of stuff but I'm trying not to so if something is a period oh sorry alright so now I have to force myself to either paint or work out I'm going to do both I'm telling myself I'm going to do both I just have to figure out what order I'm gonna do them in I might paint first cuz I want to go for like a jog maybe but it's like 70 degrees out so I don't really want to get that sweaty so I might wait till it gets cooler outs don't know I don't really know what else to say there's really nothing else to discuss here okay I'll catch up with you on whatever I do um so it started raining like 15 seconds into my job so well actually it started as a walk but then it started raining so then I had to jog home so  I am so out of shape this would have been so easy like a year ago like I would laughed at this workout and no I'm in pain okay of me trying to get up off this chair after just doing that workout my knees give out I will admit that I was just on my phone for probably about six hours am i ashamed and disgusted yes that's it that's all I have to say yeah I was just we're all feeling like that okay I can't I can't do anything so then I just cycle through the same three apps all the time and I just can't convince myself to get up and actually go do something so I didn't end up painting but you know I was still getting some good laughs from tick tock my serotonin levels we're still being raised so that's all that really matters at this point but um my eyes hurt you can probably see it in my eyes the pain so I'm just gonna go to bed yep that's it so I just want a little outro and say thanks for watching um it's been a while you've been subscribed but you stayed thanks I knew I would be back one day at least I hope that would and who knows how often when I post but if you did like this please let me know in the comments so I know to continue um if you have any video suggestions because obviously I can't vlog every day because we don't do anything I'm wearing quarantine then let me know and yeah I just want to say I don't know how to do this anymore with the foot
