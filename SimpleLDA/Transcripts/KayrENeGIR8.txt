give you guys little sneak peek of what my hair looked like and what I was doing right now do you see my head oh my god it has gotten so crazy I love standing by this what no but I really do do the barber I was over here taking pictures and stuff by the window next to my succulent babies when this quarantine lifts my barber is going to Fitness the  out of me don't play ok what was he thinking oh my god oh my god we just finished working out I am really trying to stay fit and active and stay awake so that way when this Warren team warranty when this wood so that way when this Warren team lifts

got a sweat all of this off working out the glutes the fat stomach now what else I like cardio oh my god cardio I was fun  better move cuz I got a  shower hello hello hello this is how we water our babies I'm about to take them out so that way I can show my god there was my hair was looking crazy and I'm using this thing now this line from shea moisture jamaican black castor oil let's see what it does I know that it's been a little frizzy still every now and again so if you guys have any other hair products and I can be using during quarantine is the perfect time for me to test them I'm going to try this now maybe for about a month to see I was just doing the court the curl moisture one total on gotta have a sympathetic ela with ginger ale but I was using a curl moisture line from Shea Moisture and it was leaving my hair really really dry so we're going to see what this one does for me during during this little quarantine or long or big-ass quarantine um yeah we today was my third day working out and we have been a little bit more motivated to work out and you just have to we've been finding ourselves just like thinking about the future and speaking about the future and using that as a way for us to kind of go through this entire thing I've used as you saw in my other video I was by the Sun in my son's room and I loved to just stare out that window to kind of see what life looks like on the outside it is a little sad however getting some Sun by a window really does you some good okay it's really late right now and we still have any and dinner Michels in the kitchen cooking dinner I'm super hungry but a little tipsy so hopefully the dinner sits a while and tastes a really bombs oh hey babe look at him getting ready to be showcased in the video today people were going crazy in the United States of America because they got their stimulus checks I still have a guideline and so when I heard my father her and my mother got their stimulus charts like when I jump on fighting our taxes today we file the checks our taxes literally today and apparently they were accepted by the IRS so we should be receiving our taxes and that stimulus check coming our way very very soon I'm going to be very smart about that stimulus check but no shade to the American government before shape to the American government get on canada's wave because Canada is literally doing what they have to do for their people USA it ain't me it ain't me you could do so much better we recently bought some stuff from Amazon getting packages in our new apartment we thought was going to be a little bit scary but it's not or a little bit difficult but it's not we again live on the first floor and the packages they get here in a really good way it doesn't seem too much it doesn't seem to be too much of an issue we got our AC yesterday it was a blazing balls up in here and every time you slept we were like sticking to each other's just a little bit it is April is starting to get warmer outside and there's more Sun coming into the apartment and we really needed MACC so we got the AC yesterday and I'm super grateful that we were able to get an AC as quickly as we did FedEx was doing some crazy things sending it from facility to facility I was playing games and we've requested for it to be dropped off somewhere we were going to pick it up and the AC actually just arrived at the door it makes no sense and the guy he wanted us to stay away from him and and and I asked if he wanted us to sign anything he said no nobody touches my signature pad but me and I'm like okay whatever just take it and yesterday we did it some amazon shopping some essential amazon shopping kudos Amazon for still doing this thing I need Amazon to restock on my soul wipes what am I going to do once we run out of Lysol wipes in here and we need gloves and we need a hand soap a lot of hand soap companies are running out of stock of things and yes they're prioritizing any hospitals but we still need handsome in this household and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who still needs these things but yeah we've been speaking about positive reinforcement and thinking about the future speaking about the future we worked out and I feel a lot happier I have been speaking to my family I've been speaking to Liam he's currently with his mom and I I just feel that you need to figure out things that are really going to get you through your day so after I worked my shift at work we got up and I started just I posted a picture up on Instagram of me looking out again some good fun on this keen honey Oh and I posted up a picture and I decided to chime in on social media and really work on myself I started creating certain projects I signed up for this blog thing that I'm going to start writing about hopefully I can stick to it because I really do want to get my writing out there I love to write it really helps me express myself a lot so there are things that you can do there are people you can speak to right now who can make your life a lot easier if you live in by yourself hey call me let's be  friends of whatever I don't care send something send some send me a message or whatever we could just have a conversation it's just so good to talk to people right now make sure that you're really doing your best to stay happy stay fit don't eat food that is going to bog you down okay and if you're being a little nasty and going outside with your feet all sucio and whatever and bringing all that nastiness into your house sappy nasty clean the shoes leave a designated area for those shoes by the door who cares what it looks at right now Landro importa like leave your  at the door and stop bringing in all that disgusting mess into your house it is going to get you sick
