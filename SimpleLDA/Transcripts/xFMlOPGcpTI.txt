two months however we have been filming just so you guys know we didn't just like I mean we fell off the face of the earth I mean we fell off the face of the earth yes but we were still thinking of the channel and filming and all of that good stuff so we do have content coming your way it was just starting a YouTube channel is just there's a lot of work and it's a lot of work doing it with another person so we had to figure out what worked and have like a groove now you know so we have a lot of content a ton of content that we are just waiting to drop and I call it from the archives so it's just been what we fit up to the past few months and the reason I keep messing with my phone is because I have notes on here that Lisa and I are reading oh ha ha ha we just are gonna be consistent put out videos and have fun yeah yeah why not so today we have as a lot of you guys know duh of course how could you not everything just the coronavirus is taking up so much of our media our lives we kind of wanted to talk to you guys about what it's like to live in New York City and what it's like to be a flight attendant on top of that ya don't wanna me so here we go here we go welcome to our couch by the way yeah if you guys have never seen one of our videos Lisa and I are best friends we're roommates we are flight attendants just a little disclosure if you need it yeah we're screening all of our questions on the Apple TV cuz we're my tech cuz we're high tech and there's a TV behind you just in case you didn't know so welcome to this episode of Kovac 19 talks whoo I just had that it's like yeah the first thing I have is like how is it working at the center of the pandemic so working in New York being a flight attendant what is it like being an essential worker were classified as essential workers because we work in transportation and what's it like living in New York City so so whenever I guess whenever Corona started to become a bigger deal I don't know like I was I was a little nervous to be flying in the planes are still pretty full and yeah literally like we had our hand sanitizer every time we touched anything on the plane we were alike spritz spritz spritz spritz anyone you do I'm sanitizer like taking our vitamin C just trying to take the precautions to like stay healthy and everything but then also like a sense of guilt like I wanted to be home port quarantine II our most important evening I will put my nickname during this with all sensitivity because I I know her ona is a very deadly thing it's very deadly fires but we decided to make nicknames because that's what we do were funny girls okay so I gave Lisa the nickname Rona Lisa and it I gave Courtney in the name quarantine okay it is according to you it is according to you now they know but yeah like I wanted to be home and like stay safe you know and because we are like around so many people on a daily basis and flying all over the u.s. in and out of the epicenter as our home base like I was nervous that we were gonna catch it or that maybe we were carriers like with this whole thing you just never know so yeah like I felt guilty kind of going to work i I remember hearing about it in January specifically mm-hm and not even at work I had a girlfriend come over and it was during the Super Bowl which is in January right thank you we're a February okay so I remember okay first it's the first thing I heard about Corona was on the news and I was like oh I mean just like the rest of us we heard it on the news we didn't know how I didn't know how intense this was gonna be and I think we really underestimated this virus because we've never the world has never really dealt with something like this in our lifetimes so I remember hearing about it in the news and being like oh wow crazy and then I remember like fast forward to the Super Bowl I have one of my friends over just to like you know hang out have a sleepover whatever and she's also a flight attendant and I remember her talking about the severity of kovat and how like the first cases were coming into New York February came that happened full flights completely full flight everything was done London no one thought it was gonna be as very different as it is and yeah I don't know I think in history like like you said like in our lifetime when things came up with vaccines and definitely for the swine-flu Bowl all these things and also like the numbers at that time people were comparing it to the regular like flu influenza yeah they're like it's just a cold there's nothing to worry about everyone know now we're quarantined now we're quarantined no sorry guys just get used to that I think like weird noises and faces all the time but yeah so February February was like fine March came and I remember the beginning of March is when things started getting really really serious I remember going to work and having flight attendants like just being passengers we call it deadheading it's where the company wants to get a group of flight attendants from one area to another so they can work a you know work a trip or work of white but you get paid to do it it's company travel I remember a Deadhead er came up to my crew in early March and they were like yeah like I think furloughs are gonna start happening and blah blah blah and layoffs and they predicted all these things I guess I just never marched was when things started to get very real oh yeah so then on the flights they reduced the service so like we weren't even serving drinks to people or like snacks or thing is by request um so that was weird because we loved a beverage cart we do we love working the beverage cart so we loved working we loved work yeah like we shouldn't be complaining about like not working at work but I thought we both liked to keep busy you know and then I heard for one day I was like I'm useless I've never had to oh my dad I'm gonna send him a text guys can you do that yeah sorry can't talk what is that baby yeah okay so yeah but we were on like reducing service I was low key to like somebody gives me something to do yeah give me a math problem to solve I don't know you know you read about people who are at higher risk and  they're like over it's our nature if they have like pre-existing health conditions they're more at risk to catch Corona well we were serving these people on the plane they're like I don't know what kind of germs were carrying there was a point where I was even flying international and it and we're taking this subway to think about all of the germs that like I'm hearing yeah and then I don't want this subway and then I'm giving everyone all those germs so it really the amount of stress like it was they didn't even really change how they clean the planes no and it was not often I think now that they're now they're making new rules where you have to like deep clean it every day but I wasn't every day guys before I don't know I don't even want to guess but it was not often this is pretty much I mean I don't want to speak on behalf of all US carriers but in our experience and our experience from what I've seen is like we will park the plane the passengers will get off as the passengers are deep planing the cleaners will sometimes run on and there they will literally right in like less than a minute no okay so one time I was in it was like five minutes it was somewhere and and we were getting off like my crew and I were getting off the plane we were having like a layover I like to talk to the cleaners and like see you know have a nice day house knowing and he told me that they had five minutes to flip the plane a plane it was an airbus so that's around like a hundred eighty-five it's 200 ish people it's around 200 and you're gonna clean a 200 passenger plane in five minutes and there's only like a couple of them so they're doing a lot better they're like they're drink better now with all this but before they were stretched out to because we knew how I'm Glen Neeley yeah they weren't clean yes Glen Lee cleanses so once the numbers were higher and everyone was doing like voluntary quarantines and everything um the planes were super empty so like we would be on and almost told your passenger plane with five people and that was weird getting on a plane that made for 200 people but you know there's five to ten people on these aircrafts now which is good social distance yeah like we it's not like we don't support it it's just weird it's a weird reality to live in and you see Carey walk through the airports and there's no body and we're people like flight attendants are people people like they love to be around people and genuinely like yeah it's lonely it is and this job can be lonely to begin with so take that extra social interaction away like they get sad it does and then we would go so like you you spent your day not doing anything and then they're like okay now it's time to go to the hotel okay where you also can't do anything literally we have been to places we're like the hotel across the street is empty and shut down like there was like a Hilton that was like shut down yeah I'm one of our layover know businesses are open maybe like one or two places for take-out maybe and so like we have to pack like cans of soup on a layover yes we don't know where a next meal is where I'm from  yeah it was just super eerie and weird to see something that was so lively not be MD but with that said we're happy everyone's being safe yeah and following the guidelines to stop the spread and flatten the curve yeah is the airline giving you supplies so they always provided gloves for the flight attendants and then recently they started eating out masks honestly we we didn't really know the answer to this question because we haven't been working when we stopped flying they weren't they weren't the death mask but then there's a company-wide email that said that they are so that thanks vegging that's great speaking of not working right now basically the company sent us an email saying that all of the New York City flight attendants will be grounded and the flights going in and out of New York would only be turns which is like when you go say like from Chicago to New York to Chicago so they'd be turns run by people from other bases so yeah we're grounded for a month we're not flying we're not lying and witches Danica's you look her job but at the same time I'm really happy that we get to participate in the quarantine now yeah and it's good too because the company that we're working with we we are a protected because it's not our fault that the government decided to restrict fights as much as they did okay some changes that we had to make um we're trying to cook it homework which has been so fun yeah I mean I think we kind of forgot that we could cook because it was pretty bare for a while yeah we were like surviving off canned soup and salad we just like what something easy to make soup and I like a TV dinner like you don't want to have to cook and when you're not home you don't buy groceries really yes cuz they're gonna go back at the point so we've been cooking a lot more and I'm proud of us me too work sure all the world we're cute
