 hey guys welcome back to the channel I'm in the bathroom in the guest bathroom at my mom's house so today is induction day and so I just wanted to document this whole thing one because this is a crazy season in time everything happening with kovat 19 and I just want other mothers that are maybe about to go into labor pretty soon or be induced if they know what's kind of gonna happen at the hospital I just want to have some information out there but right now where my mom is dropping our two-year-old off Cecily if you don't know about her if you haven't watch this channel before only I and my husband are allowed to be in the room and of course the midwives and things like that but so yeah I just wanted octoman it and for our families because they won't be able to be there like they normally would but right now we're about to eat my mom made me like a Last Supper a fried catfish and fries and salad which is really sweet of her because it's my favorite food and I'm just gonna enjoy that enjoy each other before retina I have to go to the hospital and eat so oh and I want to give you all like a belly update before I eat so this is me with a sweater just look why I can't really tell impress it but this is me at 39 weeks in one day yeah haven't like really you know dropped or anything I don't feel like I made my belly's point the eyes even sees my belly buttons like that but I'm still pretty up there but hopefully the induction will help baby whatever because we don't know what the gender is come on out probably by tomorrow that's what happened listen  this is  all right so I'm back it's like 10 o'clock now I was gonna record coming in but let me tell you coming in there's only one entrance to our Hospital it was already very quiet and like nobody's here like it just seemed like we were breaking into the hospital or something but there was only one entrance you could go through and right when you walked in they were checking your temperatures giving out these masks and then they willed me to labor and delivery and then after that I got into a room they asked me on the questions and things like that so I'm just now getting like settled down they inserted a sari they inserted a cervical balloon to start my induction for tonight so I'm just going to sleep through the night they gave me medicine but yeah we have to rhett and I both have to wear these all the nurses are wearing them everybody in here is wearing them and you have to keep them on the whole time so not gonna lie it isn't like the best thing in the world like not saying it ruins the experience or anything but it definitely um I don't know yeah sex that's where it sit and to just think about like meeting your child with this mask on your face I guess like it's not ideal I'll say that it's just my ideal um but we're gonna still keep our spirits high thankful that they're just taking these precautions as it is to make sure the babies are safe and that everyone is safe everyone's safe so I'd rather people not be spreading the virus than I guess not having a mask you know so like I said they gave me ambien so hopefully I get some good sleep tonight and I will see you guys in the morning they'll be coming here every hour to check on the baby so I don't know how gonna sleep I'm gonna be getting but hopefully some good rest but just kind of let you guys know what to expect if you go into labor during this time this might happen to you I know some women can't even have their husbands here so I'm very thankful very thankful that I can be here but it definitely is a different labor experience in general from last time not being able to see the nurses smile or see Brett smiling at me and stuff like that just you know have to smize as they say smile with your eyes so it's just different but still good still excited to see baby and like again I'll let you guys go for now and give you further updates as things progressed around 4:30 they came in well I was already in the bathroom luckily but they were coming in to tell me that they're gonna start pitocin and in about 20 minutes or so so I just want to let you guys have an update on that we are still wearing the masks and nothing has changed about that I do kind of feel like they tried to speed up the baby coming more than my water hasn't broken or anything like that the balloon hasn't come out it's still up there so it is about 10 a.m. in the morning I've been having the pitocin since 5:00 every 30 minutes they a bit they just took out my cervical balloon and I am having contractions if I'm like four minutes or five minutes person way in there but I'm really long guess they heard but they don't hurt they don't obviously feel good but I'm not one to really keep complaining about pain so we'll see how that goes I didn't really say anything last time and like my water broke and I was just like but now have better obviously I know better this time but yeah so we're just waiting no need for an epidural I hope for this whole thing I did want to give this piece of information that I forgot to say yesterday I believe if you are going to lay brain you do want an epidural at least here at this hospital they're suggesting that you do it almost like right away when you get here I'm not sure for the exact reason why but they said just with everything going on I guess because all of the what would it be anesthesiologists are all around going around doing things so it might take a long time for you to get it done so now they're suggesting that you get it done sooner than later but that's just a little snippet of information for those of you like I said that might be needing you never do during your payment y'all doing your labor laboring process but yeah we're just waiting right talk to my grandma she's gonna bring in some food since I can't leave instead and hopefully baby will be here afternoon late afternoon or something like that we're just excited and these masks face masks look if it blow my makeup off but um these masks are so hot you guys I'm not going right hate to tell but I mean it's just something I have to do for safety but just be prepared for that as well if you are gonna be coming to the hospital in a couple of months or so so they came to check me and I was at a four so they went ahead and decided to go ahead and break my water so they did that and they cut down my pitocin a little bit just because they did bring my water to see what my body is going to do by itself um the contractions are getting a little bit more frequent not really more pain just more frequent so it's just annoying but I'm still good I just ate some water break hashbrowns which we're really good and I have some dr. pepper I'm trying some water through the contractions cuz it just kind of helps me focus and head out for some Christian music playing and Rick is over there eating his butter burger 10:55 when do you think the baby will be here 130 compared to here first here folks Cecily came at 135 was it 108 it was like literally nothing so we'll see   everybody this is a post baby Aliyah is having some Wendy's that her grandma picked up and this is if I can get it felici so Leah left you off we hadn't that just weren't broke her water it's probably 2 or 3 hours after that that the contractions started getting really close together and we knew that it was gonna be time for the baby and so before they called the Midwife and before she could even get there Aleeah was just blurting out like oh the baby's coming and so the Midwife walks in and not three minutes later the baby's here because that's just how it is so everything went great no complications of any kind so far baby felici is doing well sleeping a lot eating eight almost a full two ounces right out of the gate so that's that's pretty substantial for a newborn according to all the nurses so and she doesn't really fuss about anything which is kind of what we expected just cuz that's how Cecily was when she came out but that's all I got for you right now hey guys it's 9:40 once almost 10:00 just been resting and eating and stuff like that um I just took a shower a very quick one because I was about to pass out but and just light down took off my makeup and stuff like that but to hit to bed where it's gonna do the first night feeding and I'm gonna do the ones that are basically like in the morning like two and five felici a baby leacy he's doing well she's just sleeping she doesn't even cry when they poked her foot or gave her a shot or anything she was just a hungry sleepy sweet baby and we can be more blessed to have her in our lives um I did want to say that our hospital was out of the sensitive like formula so I don't know if other hospitals are running out of things but if you think your baby might need special formula if you're going to formula feed I suggest bringing it with you and a couple bottles and like dish stuff or whatever if they can clean them just in case that happens because I don't know if it's because of Kovac 19 if they aren't getting shipments in or just because you know this hospital just happened to be out it four out of it for a week or so but I would be prepared it's better to be prepared than not have anything and having to have somebody bring it or somebody go run out to get it so I would definitely do that but yeah we're just ready for some rest tonight and ready hopefully to be discharged to our baby lacey has she tested positive for you know remember this cause babe I was called but basically recognized blood types are very different so she's probably too may be developing jaundice so we'll see tomorrow but if not then it's usually 24 hours after you know you have the baby and things that you can leave so tomorrow we should be a believe if nothing with her or with I you know except for anything so that'll be good man we're just gonna get some rest love on this baby I can't wait to see our other baby tomorrow or Wednesday depending on my head hey guys um back we are headed home I just wanted to give some last-minute insight about the hospital so first of all if I don't think I said this before but if you are wanting to use nitrous oxide during your labor at least at our hospital they're not doing it because of the virus so be prepared be prepared for that you may have to do an alternative form of pain management that's not bad or if that's not the way you want to go so just be thinking on that and asking your nurses what are your different forms of pain management besides epidurals since the not just nitrous oxide might not be available and also I would also if you your visitor because at least in our hospital there was only one visitor allowed sorry resident guess but um I would advise that visitor not to leave the hospital ground because like at our hospital they were talking about how the rules are always changing like hourly the rules are changing so I would advise you not to UM not to let that visitor leave just in case the rules change so that they're already there just to be on the safe side and also once we got to the postpartum floor of our Hospital we weren't able to take our mask off in the room the nurse has always had their masks on and like workers or anything like that but we were allowed to take them off in the room but if ret were to go outside of the room to like get coffee or ice or water or anything like that then he did have to have his mask on so I'm not sure if all hospitals will be having rules like we'll have rules like that in their postpartum floor but just there could be some lighteth and the tunnel where you don't have to wear the mask the full time um but I think that's all of the things I would say to expect during labor at this time of course things are like I said they say things change hourly if things get better maybe you will be able to have more visitors than I was or if they get worse you may not be able to have any at all and if you can't I I'm praying for all those moms that you know can't have anybody in them in the room with them because that is definitely something I would not want to do with just even medical staff like without red there I would be devastated so I'll definitely be praying for anybody that does get bad news and even for those they can't just have one visitor because some people like having multiple family or friends surrounding them during this time so just be careful out there guys if you are expecting so congratulations on the new baby it's still an exact time and don't let this get you down I'm selling I've been we're so happy to have a new bundle of joy in our lives and I can't wait for you to have your bundle joy in as well see you later bang
