besides but these are their roasted mushrooms and onions and then these oh that's the roasted spinach or the saute pan there imma dingus there's definitely great steakhouse sides and then this is cookies from the Scotch no but these are roasted peewee potatoes they're so fire and then they came with Alex you're gonna love this they have the bread all for out what like you can have something

leftovers um so good  really hi  hi guys so we are back and we are at Blake's parents house in Naperville I literally just got out of the shower hence why I'm in the bathroom but I just put on some clean clothes and I am honestly so exhausted we're staying here tonight which is so nice but traveling was good it was honestly like it was better I feel like on the way back then on the way there but um yeah I mean it's obviously a weird time and traveling is obviously so weird during this time we just had to wear a mask the whole time on the plane um and just like obviously like we took precautions and um yeah honestly my brain is so foggy right now I don't know but it um which like brought Lysol wipes and it did all that jazz and nature we were like so far this is singing as fast as we could but um we put in a to-go order or I put in to order we all like put in different ones for food I got a veggie burger and some veggie sides from this place called Hugo's and then Blake and I are gonna go to Whole Foods tonight cuz I want to pick up some things and it's actually like a beautiful beautiful night out this guy looks gorgeous so I'm gonna go downstairs and touch base with Ben I might make a drink honestly I kind of want one um but yeah that's kind of the plan right now I just feel so much better after I shower it honestly so I'm just happy we're seeing here tonight so that we're like not obviously driving back to Iowa baby words cancel why cuz they were too busy guys look at the sky it seriously felt pretty up I am outside and enjoying my drink um the boys went to go pick up Thai food my foods not gonna be ready for a little bit so I just figure I would sit here and just kind of talk to you guys a little bit and just like relax a little bit get a little bit of a long time obviously we've been moderately tight quarters pretty tight quarters honestly for the past like two weeks now which is crazy but I'm really just like happy that we're here I just love being in naperville I know that sounds so weird but I think it's just like such I don't know I just always feel so relaxed here it's like I don't know it just kind of hits different I don't know how to describe it it's just like I love Blake's parents house and I love the bed that we sleep in when we're here I know that sounds so weird but it's so cozy and their house I love their kitchen and I just love their house and it smells like they built it like kind of recently ish so it smells like a new house and I just love it so and I'm excited to get to go food tonight it's gonna be really yummy I have like a baked potato and a veggie burger so fire so yeah and then I don't know when Blake and I are gonna leave in the morning I like kind of want to be able to like get up go to walk get a coffee like maybe just like chill a little bit honestly this weather feels so refreshing them I don't know this is so random this is like a random string of thoughts but it feels so refreshing after being in Florida which was obviously so nice to do so hot they're like so hot so like this sweatshirt and like sweat shorts weather feels so good I'm kind of thriving loving it I think there's a woodpecker I don't know but I think this might be leaking his brother that was so fast so speedy and they're honking at me those because they know I'm vlogging whatever okay well I'm probably not to leave soon I

we're gonna walk are we going to yeah let's do it okay and we got some good stuff at Trader Joe's I'll do like a mini haul for you guys cuz we got some random stuff to try like the chicken less even okay guys we're back from our walk I'm showing you what we got from Trader Joe's so first thing is the raw almond butter I love this it's so good it's literally the only ingredients is raw almonds it smells so good it's just like the best stuff ever um and I've been eating almond butter again cuz I use so like it just made me break out so I wouldn't eat it but I've been eating it again and haven't been breaking out so I'm like kinda back on the almond butter kick so yeah um and then next I got a mango tabatha my breakfast got eleven so I can make pot one in water like got their powdered peanut butter he likes having this in like smoothies yeah I used to like it a lot more than I do it doesn't um I grab some they're great for even lemon hand sanitizer because it smelled so good oh my god whatever you always need more hand sanitizer these days right so yeah it has moisturizing aloe and vitamin E and I actually really like it I used it a few times already we got these crackers these original savory same crackers these are so good they taste like the almond nut things if you've ever tried those by Blue Diamond but these have just like a little bit better ingredients in their fire um we both bought everything but the bagel seasoning you know what I got a papaya tree Rose has the best papaya okay not the best papaya but they have really good for pi so if you're looking to try it get this don't buy pre-cut papaya it's just amazing just cut it yourself I've made that decision bird that missing then I got some tahini because I wanted to put on my avocado toast today and you can never have too much tahini and it's just I just we were there so I was like I'll just pick it up here instead of getting in Iowa City and then last but not least like and I got these this is not used our usual vibe but we truck we're gonna try it it's the vegan chicken less seasoning so so it has sea salt onion powder spices turmeric and garlic powder so you guys know how this is I'm a little wary of it but yeah but anyways that's what we got from Trader Joe's we're gonna make some brekkie and then see what we end up like leaving or whatever see what would you I just made some brekkie and I put
