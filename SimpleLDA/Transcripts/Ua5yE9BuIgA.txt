 yeah I got the Quran  well I struggled for a little bit and whether to make this video or not because I know that some of you out there are suffering the consequences of this virus in losing a loved one or someone who's very ill and in the hospital and may not recover but I figured I would go ahead and put it out there for those of you that would like to know what to do what not to do what to look for as far as symptoms and my symptoms are this severe cough that comes and goes and it it's like little episodes of it and then I will have an occasional fever but it doesn't last very long because I take some acetaminophen and some things to kind of control it but body aches and pains is terrible and I sleep in spurts I seem to sleep 2 to 4 hours at a time so anytime I'm starting to feel a little bit better I will lay down and try to get some sleep but other than that I'm just staying here in quarantine staying here at the house trying not to infect anyone else I have loved ones better around occasionally I don't want to infect them but here now is the video usually video anytime I go do anything significant just in case I might want to put it out as a video here on YouTube so I hope you get some information out of this I please be careful be careful out there this is a serious thing especially for those with underlying health issues and low immunity here's some information I hope it helps and I hope you get something out of this well that's it I'm sick hello my name is man welcome back to who's your back outdoors if you are new to the channel you like anything and everything to do with the outdoors click on that subscribe button give us a big thumbs up click the notification mail that way you're notified every time we post a new video much appreciated yes my voice sounds different because I am sick to the walk-in clinic I called my local ER to begin with and they patched me through to someone who they said was going to screen me and they didn't screen me for Kovac 19 they simply told me to come into their emergency room which is true which was an hour and a half away I'm not really feeling up to that so I I just went to our local walk in has opened you check down hopefully it's just a I had cold we can find out two or three of my symptoms are those Kovach 19 coronavirus go and walk in and you know seems like an Ellen see just a minute well they let me go in just long enough to get my paperwork came back out to the car fill the paperwork out took it back in came back out to the car and sit down and the nurse practitioner called me and informed me that they said if our emergency room here suggested that I go to Indianapolis to get tested then that's probably what I should do because they don't do any testing here in my County although there's been five two cases at least five confirmed cases here in Pike County guessing they say that's people in Annapolis too so it looks like it's from early I mean it's it looks like I'm going in Annapolis to get Testament really really stinks but looks like where I made it so we'll take you with us and see what happens  you well I got the code yeah I got the coronavirus well the news isn't good went all the way to Indianapolis for them just to tell me that yes I have kovat 19 and the doctor didn't do any testing but I asked him how many patients he had seen but had Kovac 19 and he said a bunch more than I can count and he said that all my symptoms were exactly what he'd been saying with over 19 he said all my symptoms had and what he had been seeing from Kovac 19 patients so instead of using a test and wasting a test on a healthy individual with no underlying illnesses or sicknesses he just said yes so he put me on 14 night quarantine so I guess this is day one I asked him if I could still go fish and he said yeah that'd be fine as long as you go by yourself so maybe get to feel a little bit better having this fish and take the video camera so we'll see what happens I never thought I'd get this but it is what it is people make do as we can try to stay healthy take some vitamins plenty of water and let's see how it turns out hopefully you guys haven't gotten it hopefully you're having a great weekend great week whenever I get this video posted I really appreciate all of you you might say a prayer for my wife she'll be having to deal with me her her sick baby for a little while and we know how this guy's can get more sick thanks for listening to me rant talk about the coronavirus so hopefully we can stay healthy and other people from getting infected and we'll see you next time but until next time practice good social distancing but get out there and enjoy the outdoors I'll see you guys later keep us in your prayers  you
