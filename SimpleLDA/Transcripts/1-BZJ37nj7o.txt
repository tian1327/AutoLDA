 coronavirus manufacturing CNC machining going through the valleys like this world is changing before our eyes colleges are closing big events sports everything being canceled you can't even find food like even canned goods at the grocery stores are being sold out not to mention the toilet paper and the soul but like it is crazy out there  uh what's up everybody this is tighten tightens up CNC and it is Sunday and I'm at my shop by my self and I thought you know what I got a little bit of work to get done but I thought you know what people are seriously like frightened right now people are seriously they don't know what's going on the news is like just boom boom boom and it is a serious thing the corona virus is a serious thing right it's gonna get worse before it gets better but in times of trial right in times where the world hits you in your face one thing that I've learned through manufacturing is that you need to be cool under pressure right before I start my own shop I ran companies I went through crazy valleys and crazy things I solved problems for other people and through each valley and through every problem I realized that I would come out a little bit more experienced right so now that I have my own company whenever things happen I'm cooling the pressure right because I've seen so many different things the coronavirus right now it is insane but if you watch and listen to the doctors if you watch the news and and read between the lines they give you steps wash your hands you know disinfect everything make sure that you you separate yourself in and maybe not shake hands but but stand there politely and talk to people you know take take time to actually make sure that your family is safe and that you're safe and and put the love out there for other people know then maybe you shouldn't take that extra can of food or that extra bag of toilet paper because you have plenty leave it for somebody else because we are all one big family right so there are things out there that will allow us to be safe during this time or safer during this time right and one thing that I want to say to you guys is we will get through it like we will get through it no matter what country you're in no matter who you are no matter what situation you're in we're all family and we will get through it I've seen many things through my life and when you look at manufacturing we have our highs and we have our lows and people with experience who've been in it they know that if you're cool-headed you're just gonna go through it even if it's hard but you will come out you know this time makes me think about 2008-2009 right which is the time period that I went through when I when the whole economy collapsed and I had to layoff 40 employees and and and I didn't know what to do and I went through crazy trials and and like the whole world like just was falling around me and I saw 50,000 companies going out of business and every turn in every place I went for help like there was no help from anyone I lost my house I lost my cars I lost like everything but through that experience I would learn and I would look at manufacturing and the importance of manufacturing I would I would I would look at how things are and it would give me a passion for making things and not only for making things but it give me a passion to break through walls to speak to real manufacturers and and future manufacturers and and show people process and and discuss and advocate for this trade because I saw how bad it was right I when when when everything was falling around me like I used to go to the forest Hill bridge by my shop and I would like go on the bridge and I would kneel and I would like pray and I'd be lord please do not take my shop for me like like Lord Allah help me like employee people like help me keep this thing going like like I would go through so much and I literally saw everything for but if somebody could have just said and tapped me on the shoulder at that moment and said Titan you're gonna lose you're going to have machines taken you're going to like have to leave your shop but in just a few short years you will rebuild yourself you will start speaking into people's lives you start changing lives and you know what Titan you're gonna have two babies you're gonna have twin babies they're gonna be born on 7-7 it's gonna be a miraculous time for you and your family and like your whole life is gonna take off and it's gonna go in a different direction you're gonna go into a prison system and you're gonna build a school what come on manufacture out like how would that happen I'm not a teacher you know going to st. Quinn you're gonna build a school and then that school is gonna go through and more prisons and then it's gonna catch fire and they're gonna start building schools throughout the world today we have 2,500 schools they use our resources it could have never happened if I hadn't gone through 2008-2009 and saw what I saw people look at my passion and they'll say Titan like are you too passionate goodness I will never apologize for my passion because I went through the hard times I understand what it is to to like suffer through trying to make payroll week after week and have to have heartfelt talks with employees that you consider family like like I understand what it is and therefore if you are in this trade without passion you already are at a deficit so now I'm all about advocating I'm all about the trade I'm all about mentoring I'm all about just standing firm and speaking words of an herdsman and wisdom and and basically helping people go through what I've already gone through because we are family right today we have the Academy we we have an amazing huge shop and we're expanding and I have an amazing team but back in 2008-2009 I couldn't see it I didn't have the vision I was drowning so because of that experience and knowing where I am now and knowing where I used to be I will tell each and every one of you that no matter what country you're from take pride in that slide no matter what culture you're from love that culture and help people around you and get serious about manufacturing because my every single country in the world needs manufacturing not all of us are are built for a service right meaning the service industry not everybody's gonna be a banker doctor a lawyer there are people in all societies that were made to build things and that's what we have to fight for manufacturing today it's important that we are safe during this corona virus epidemic it's important that we lift each other up that we encourage each other that we treat each other like family that we understand that this will also pass and if we lose our job or we get sent home we got to understand that it will pass we will come through it it will get better again we will find cures we will find the right medicines and and and internal things that will allow us to get through this this time and then we will thrive on the other side and we will leave this in the past but what did we learn we learned that manufacturing is important that we need to manufacture things in our own countries right so when you have an epidemic when you have things you have supplies close by if you're in Australia you need to manufacture your own parts here if you're in China if you're in Brazil if you're in the UK if you're in America you need to manufacture a great majority of your own parts because that's just the way it is and that is that is how important it is if there is anything I won't say that there's bright things happening but I will say that the media never talks to our manufacturing the media never talks about things because they need the drama to get the views but today they're talking about manufacturing today they're wondering why we don't have certain medicines they're wondering why we don't have certain things and we're speaking about the importance of actually making things and having things here in case there is a natural disaster in case something happens in the world we need to be close by so there is a renewed focus on manufacturing and that's good so my prayers go out to all the families out there anybody who is scared who's who's struggling who might be sick like my team and I like we're here with you and our prayers go out to you and and uh I'm gonna do my best just to bring forth that leadership and that calmness to anybody who like follows us if you if you have questions if you have concerns if you want to talk write down in the comments go ahead and put your comments down I read every single one and I will respond look at our Facebook group the private group Titans of CNC Academy the Facebook group that is a community of over thirty some thousand makers that come together to help each other to lift each other up to teach each other check it out if you are home and you don't have nothing to do and you're wondering what to do this thing is the Academy it's free I'm not trying to make money off you guys it is free for years in years people said oh he's like wait I have never asked anything of anybody asks all the teachers we got 25 minutes schools they use our resources I've never asked anything we give resources because nobody else has done it and that is the lifelong passion and vision that's my path in life that I've found it to serve my community and that's how I get joy and that's how I get fulfillment because we're serving our family our manufacturing family so we have this Academy Academy dot Titans of CNC comm you can go up into resources and you can read the instructions but if you have time put the time into to hone your skills put the work in to learn five axes three plus two multi axis surfacing learn how to program even though everybody might say that you're wasting your time learn and then go through all the tutorials and put the time in if you have time right now or even after put the work in to up your skills so when we get past this and as we keep manufacturing you can take better care of your family because knowledge is power and the more knowledge that you have the more money that you make which allows you to actually put food on the table so again coronavirus anybody dealing with things cool and the pressure do what you got to do our prayers are with you we love you guys I love you guys I love you guys all right got any comments put it down below all right I will talk to you guys later keep watching we're gonna put more videos more mentoring videos more machining videos just all of it all right take care I love you you
