 it's peachy-keen everything is working great with workflow alive   develop my talents and stuff within the company so you girl it's good in man life is great time to celebrate where's of you guys I hope you all are doing swell and welcome back to my channel so I got home pretty early from work today is Friday and it is about 4:14 right now you should get off at 4:00 and I don't make it home until about 4:30 but today has been well this entire week has been just literally from one extreme to the next if you guys are under a rock right now we have the corona virus or the covet 19 that's literally just spreading and RAM fire so my company is so big we got the news last week that we might be sitting home this week to work from home and so today was the day that they started making the moves for everyone to start working from home so I have a huge box in this corner right behind me and I'm gonna kind of set up because I'll probably be working home for sure the next two weeks but probably it'll end up being like the next month or so working from home so that is gonna be very fun documenting this entire process because I've never liked had a nine-to-five full-time career job working from home because this is my very first career and it'll probably be my last with the company because it's literally the company of my dreams I think I say that in every single video but I've never like worked properly from home I've done like my creative stuff from home especially within my post-grad year bu I brought all of my stuff home so I brought my monitor usually at work I have two big screens so I'll do like analytical stuff on one respond to emails phone calls all that stuff on an other screen but I just brought one monitor home so depending on how next week turns out was like working for mom I might go back and get another screen the goal for today is to set up my desk so I am gonna be working from my living room you know our kitchen table I'm gonna set up my little stuff tonight and like take you guys behind the scenes of all of that but I got all of my stuff from my desk like all my important documents on all the different logistics of the company and operations so I know how to properly do that when I'm on the phone next week then I also got my company phone so this is just the iPhone 11 I have it as well but I have it in white but they gave us all iPhone Elevens in red I put the Do Not Disturb on because I'm I'm off of work so I don't need it to be on and also I need to actually set up my Wi-Fi to this and luckily my company as well is paying for all of us to get a better speed of internet so right now I have AT&T that actually to go through and increase my megabyte speed so everything runs as smoothly as possible so right now I am planning on just setting up my entire desk but today work was very very productive I got a lot of stuff done but also in the back of my head I was like oh I'm ready to go home and set up everything because I do not want to get sick um I just made some coffee I'm gonna drink some coffee and set up my stuff so I'm gonna show you guys a little bit of that but this week was a very productive work week you guys saw a few vlogs this week actually my birthday vlog s also work week in my life type of video where I both kind of touched on the covent 19 virus and how it's kind of affecting Memphis so I am just gonna be vlogging my work weeks as well but it'll be a little bit more hands-on since I will be working from home I'm also going to be vlogging a little bit for tomorrow as well because our entire city is going on like a two-week quarantine so businesses and restaurants you can't eat inside of them you can only just go in and take out so me and Kendall have some fun stuff planned for tomorrow as well so I'm gonna take you guys along for that because it's supposed to be a really beautiful day so I thought that I would document it this time of crisis that we're going through I like to bring happiness enjoy it as much as I can so I hope when you're watching this you are feeling motivated you are feeling inspired and you're not feeling down the dumps because with all this weather and all this stuff that's going on it's easy to just kind of lump around and just feel super pitiful for yourself but I'm not gonna let you guys do that we're gonna have a really good weekend and a really good day as well so I'm gonna make my coffee I got a frother which you guys have seen in like a previous vlog but I'm gonna make some coffee really quickly I've been rambling for quite some time so I'm gonna throw poorly on and we're gonna clean this counter space so I can start working from home I'm so excited then you see you guys in the montage as much as I could I took the monitor out I did all of this I put the screen right here not gonna show you my mouse pad because it has my company's name on it but then also this is what it looks like from behind so it's a pretty good setup because while I'm working I can still look outside then also when I have my web meeting I have this for the background so this is where I'm gonna be setting up shop oh I do have my Wi-Fi box that I just pulled down from the bar but I don't think I'm going to necessarily hook the computer up to it right now I think in the morning I'm going to kind of test trial and see if I can turn everything on because I do need to get an adapter or I just need to see if I have an extra one in the house that I can use but I cleaned off everything everything is good to go it's clean it's just infected then I also made me some coffee and then I have some caramel coconut creamer then I froth it on the inside so it's like a little latte so I am going to do a few things my laptop because I want to say I got the email sorry you guys are like shaking but I got an email from my grad school I'm getting my MBA in marketing so I need to make sure everything is good to go but I'm honestly I just think that email is just saying that everything will be online which I was doing online in BA anyway so cheers to that so I'm just gonna make sure everything looks good I also need to respond to some comments and I also need to like send an email to the why because that's the gym that me and my mother go to but since the corona virus outbreak all the gyms are closed so I need to make sure that our account is frozen so they're not gonna charge us monthly still because no one will be there and people sometimes do that so I need to make sure that they're not drafting anything out so feeling good I'm probably gonna eat a little snack or so because for lunch I made some shrimp vindaloo and then I had some basmati rice with that but I'm feeling a little hungry still so I might make me a little snack to eat for right now I don't know why I'm like so swayed right now with the tripod because I had you guys like hoisted on top of the computer but yeah I'm super excited I have all this like laid out and it doesn't look too crazy on the dining room table so it's also a really good thing but this camera is about to die I have two bars left on it and I want to charge it up because I want to vlog a little bit more for this evening so I'm gonna do a little bit of computer work and maybe eat a little snack and then once the camera is charged up I'll check you guys out then what does of you guys it is Monday and it is currently lunchtime right now so I thought that I would pull out my vlog camera and update you guys this is my first day of working from home and I am gonna be documenting how I acclimate to it all but so far so good the only thing right now that is kind of like haunting me is that I brought my desktop computer home which you guys saw on Friday and I'll be working for like a few hours and then it'll just stop being connected to the Internet so I think that I might need to go out some point today and and go to like Best Buy or Target or even Walmart and get a new ether Kord and just like expensive when i get back to the office but work has been really well did all of my like morning routine stuff that I usually do when I'm inside the office so I'm feeling really productive the only thing is that I need this wife I don't like get it together well like the Wi-Fi is connected with everything still because I contacted our tech support team as well as a team and everything still works fine so I think it might have to something is wrong with the ethernet cord that I took from the office it might just be old and a dud so your girl has been really productive but the last time you guys saw me was actually on Friday and I was sitting in this very exact spot and I was showing you guys like my company phone and I was just setting up shop on the dining room table but on Saturday it was just like a regular old day Kindle was like let's take pictures because it's really nice outside so we go to like my favorite spot in Harper town to one of our very first places that we went on like a fancy date and your girl is getting married I'm getting married so can the propose to me on Saturday and our proposal video and like how we met and our plans and everything that should already be up right now so check the cards up above but this weekend was such a phenomenal weekend just been hanging out with family and friends as much as we could because we don't want to hang around too many people because of the kovat virus is going around we need to be safe so so like my mom of course because I live at home with my mom something that I went to his parents house saw them and then saw his roommate and then saw my grandmother as well so we just saw like the fam but we posted pictures on like Facebook and all the different stuff so I will be documenting that whole entire process but this is my first official week of being engaged it still hasn't hit me just quite yet I'm still like what the heck I'm getting married sometime soon and all this different stuff one thing that does suck is that we can't have like an engagement party right now because we have too many family and friends and older people in that family so it's better safe than sorry so we really do an engagement party probably like in the next few months or so so yeah that's really exciting the ring is gorgeous I'm having talked about the ring more in depth but it's a really stunning ring it's so pretty and it just fits my hands like a glove some I'm so excited about everything but I didn't want to actually read a devotion as well because I feel like it really hits home for today one of the little things that I did talk about it says because I am impotent in all my ways so you need not fear that I will run out of resources abundance is at the very heart of Who I am come to me in joyful expectation of receiving all you need and sometimes much more I delight in showering blessings on my beloved children come to me with open hands and heart ready to receive all that I have for you and if you guys want to read the verses that we have for today it Psalms 36 verses 7 through 9 Psalms 132 verse 15 and also John chapter 6 verses 12 through 13 so that was a really good point I think in general okay I think in general that's a good verse to read for everything that's going on right now I hope everyone is being safe and healthy and happy paint not to like say details of the engagement because I really want you guys to see that video so I'm gonna keep my mouth closed but I'll explain my County did it I have video footage and all that different stuff so I've just been beaming I've been really excited and I'm just just really stoked about this new chapter like 25 is really showing up and showing out but I am currently making lunch right now since I am on my lunch break and then me and one of my really good friends at work Candace we're about to FaceTime so I can like catch her up on the weekend and like the engagement and also how we're acclimating to working from home because she has two older kids they're like 6 and 7 and then she has two twins and her 4 so just getting caught up on everything but I'm excited to be documenting this week guys I feel like a proper adult life is good life is great it's time to celebrate but I'm gonna finish making my lunch and then I'm also gonna restart my computer one more time to see if it will connect to the internet again that's gonna kind of haunt me for the rest of the week for being productive and y'all re no I'd like to get stuff done so I'm gonna make that happen but I'm gonna eat really quickly and I'll probably  what does it be guys I am just now getting off for work today was such a long workday and I didn't get a chance to vlog at all on my lunch break I was just like I hate to just sit here in peace we had a huge one our leading this morning and then we had another one at 1:00 I had a bunch of calls to get done but overall I am really adjusting to working online I'm getting a lot of stuff done I'm having time to respond to everyone and also planning a lot more in depth with like who I contact and all the different stuff that goes along with my role so overall I am really really enjoying it it's teaching me to learn a lot more about our system and just you know better develop my talents and stuff within the company so so far I'm really digging it but yesterday when I last night you guys I actually edited a video that's up right now it's my five minute makeup routine for work I also worked out what you guys saw I them to try on haul for a boo hoo spring thing that I'm doing on my channel and also I just relaxed I went to sleep at like 8 o'clock and then I woke up at like probably right at 7 so a good thing about working from home I'm actually getting all of my sleep but tonight I am hanging out with Kendall I just put my sweatshirt on and some jeans because I had like a a sweater on this morning just to dress up for work I am gonna be doing an outfit of the week with like work outfits from working at home so I'll be filming that as well this week I'll probably end up filming it sometime later on the week because it's it's supposed to start getting sunny like later on towards the week but I'm hanging out with Kendall and tonight also our city is doing a quarantine like recommend to stay in the house so we're just going to hang out and look at our engagement pictures so we won't be out and about but it starts at 6:00 so non and sensual businesses will be closed starting tonight at 6 o'clock the only places I know there are non-essential will be like YMCA as well as McDonald's because they'll be feeding like kids who are out of school right now but other than that the only place you can go to is the doctor which a lot of them are closing as well because my mom had a doctor's appointment the other day and Kendall had a dentist appointment earlier in the week and everything is canceled so I think the only thing that's open right now is just like the grocery store because church is closed and everything like that so I'm probably gonna end up watching church service tomorrow on my lunch break because I didn't get to watch it over the weekend so I'm super excited about that because I want to say they also have like worship too which I enjoy a worship so much I posted like me and Kendall's engagement selfie on Facebook on Saturday and one of the ladies like I go to a huge Church and it's Presbyterian so it's like a ton of people but me and Kendall went to like Chipotle one time over the summer and we made friends with the people who see it worship and so one of them who's like one of our favorite girls who we just love to listen to sing she actually comment on our picture so that made me feel really really good but got so much love and just so many well wishes from so many different avenues so I'm so excited it's only been a few days it feels weird but it also feels like we're on a next step in our relationship which of course we are but like mentally and everything else feels like it just went up a whole nother level so that's really exciting but I'm excited to hang out tonight we're going to get some boba tea and then probably get takeout food because a lot of restaurants are closed but they are still accepting takeout orders so we're gonna get some food from one of our favorite places and boba tea because I'm sure they'll close tonight as well starting at 6:00 so just try and get everything out and then support our local businesses as much as we can because we always eat local so just doing it one last big time and then we're gonna look at our engagement pictures which I am so excited about I saw a few of them that I got in some text messages but I'm going to show you guys hopefully within this vlog I'll show you some but if not in this vlog I'll definitely show you guys in our engagement video which are actually filming on Thursday so I can't upload that for Saturday so even a lot of stuff done well tomorrow supposed to be like cloudy so I think since I have a few breaks even at 3 p.m. it's gonna be sunny I get off at 4:00 so I feel like once I got for work I can quickly sit down and film that hall for boohoo and then also I have a few other videos that I think I can film very quickly they'll won't take up too much time because I need to edit those and have them geared to go because I need enough memory and storage on all of my memory cards for the video me and Kendall are filming on Thursday our engagement announcement so lots and lots of stuff this is all the videos that I have planned to film for this week I also need to prompt a podcast episode so your girl has been doing it I've been getting a lot of stuff done I really enjoyed the fact of working from home because as soon as I was done with the work yesterday I just started working out got a really good ab and yoga workout in I showered and I still had enough time to like do editing and filming like a trial portion and still went to bed at 8 o'clock or watching Brooklyn nine-nine living a good life you guys but I hope you all are being super safe there's a lot of cases out right now so I just say be very cautious make sure you wash your hands do not go out if you don't need to go out simple as that I'm only going out tonight because I need to pick our engagement photos so those can be ready for us to have them send the mail for this week because we got to do that and I want to do them together so that's why we're meeting tonight be safe and be smart out here and wash your hands and check in all your loved ones everyone because everyone is getting in now it's not just older people as people our age so make sure you're just checking in on your loved ones as well so that's my little TSA announcement I'm going to feel like I need to do something oh I'm gonna respond to some comments on my makeup video I just uploaded and I'll probably see you guys when I get food because my lunch today sucked it's awful I did a terrible job but I still ate it and made some jasmine rice sauteed broccoli and some shrimp but I put too much soy sauce in it and it was too late and I was just like really hungry so I got to keep I got to keep eating it but I'm tracking a Waterloo but idiom I've been that kind of round but idiot I've been rambling so I'm gonna charge this camera because it's about to die and I'll see you guys when they get out with Kendall what is up you guys it is almost 5:00 right now and as soon as I got for work I just filmed two videos so definitely make sure you're on the lookout for those because I talk about my favorite natural hair products as well as a spring try on haul from boohoo but you'll probably be singing this shirt a lot because I wore that in the last two videos as well because I was like I am NOT changing I'm gonna keep this on so work today you guys work was so long and exhausting and I was just a little burnt out I got I got everything done thank the Lord I got all of my work done and then some so I felt really productive but throughout the day I was just like just keep focused just keep doing just have one task in mind just keep doing that and don't focus on everything else because I felt like every little thing that could happen at work of me being agitated I was but overall it was a really productive workday and it's all just learning and getting adjusted to working on my and some yesterday I told you it's peachy King everything is working great with working online and then today I'm just like oh my gosh I'm going stir-crazy I can't do this but I made it through the day you guys I didn't even get to watch church service which I actually might end up watching tonight because like I said I just filmed two videos so I need to actually sit down and edit those two videos which shouldn't take that long because I need to clear off my memory card because tomorrow me and Kendall are actually filming our engagement video and all that different stuff so I want to make sure I have enough memory on my memory cars to like film all that stuff because it might be quite a long which I don't mind because I know people will really enjoy it especially all of our family and friends because I'm gonna post it on Facebook as well so everyone can see it well I'm gonna post a link of the video to Facebook so everyone can see it so even if it's really long all of our family and friends will really enjoy it so I don't mind that I love long videos but well I got videos to edit tonight I want to also if have enough time start editing this vlog because I feel like I haven't properly updated you guys like my intentions where I work and I'm trying to only walk while I'm on lunch breaker after work because your girl is professional like that but yesterday when you guys last saw me me and Kendall went and got ooh it's called Casablanca and it's like Egyptian medicine rannian food and it was so good I got a falafel and then we got bubble tea and then we watched what's that man's name you guys saw it cuz I showed you in the video but it's the man that had all those animals and stuff and that's a crazy documentary on Netflix never really wanted to watch the documentary so we watched four episodes of that last night it was me Kendall and then his roommate chance also he watched a few and then me and Kendall looked at our engagement pictures as well but I made the executive decision that I wasn't gonna show them within this vlog because I want everyone to go and watch our engagement announcement video and I will show pictures via that so I was like I'm gonna show you guys pictures or anything but sorry don't hate me but oh they turned out so beautiful and they're such our aesthetic of like greenery and just really nice and clean so I am just super thrilled about that so we look through all the pictures and made some of our favorites so probably tomorrow we're gonna make the last selection of our favorites so that we can send those in for them to send us like a book of pictures that we ordered like proofs and they're gonna make it into a really pretty album for us so it still hasn't hit me I'm sure I'll hit later on down the line when we actually start planning and we're gonna have our engagement party but world is just so crazy right now with everything going on with the virus so we're taking it very slow in regards to that I'm sure as we start planning and all the different stuff we will it will feel more like oh this is actually happening but that is everything that I've been up to I'm so glad I got all my stuff that I really wanted to do done like my creativity so I'm going to probably do a really quick home workout and then shower and then start editing so when I watched church or when I'm editing I'll check you guys out in a bit because I need to actually clean this memory card off because I'm about to run out of storage so I'll see you guys in a bit      what is it you guys it is Thursday and I haven't walked for today because I have work all day I had a lot of big important meetings and phone calls all different stuff and then I got ready and then I started hanging out with Kendall which hey we filmed our engagement video and then right after that we went and got food and bubble tea so we are I'm about to show you guys really quickly what we got from sushi so we have a full spread we have fried vegetable rice we have some steamed veggies as well I don't know the names of these rolls but we got three different types of rolls together soy sauce our waters we're good to go and we're gonna watch Tigers something Tiger nation was actually the the guy doing exotic Joe exotic and I listen to so many podcasts about him so we're gonna finish watching Joe exotic and his crazy self and eat but I went to say hello I am Alive I've done a lot of stuff today so and work it was so busy I got a lot of stuff done though and then I actually added a video as well so we've been on top of everything I've been doing a lot but I want to say hello it's Thursday we're about to eat   what are you guys it is eight o'clock on Friday evening and I didn't vlog much today because this morning was another very busy workday we had a big meeting and then I had joint calls with my manager and then I had three conference calls with my field sales and then I also just had a lot of stuff to like catch up on so overall it was a really great day but it was really really rewarding because I got acknowledged for all of my like very great like calls and I'm all the hard work I'm doing and how organized I am as well so that felt really really good I sent an email earlier this week to my manager in our like district manager about some really exciting stuff about what I've been doing it worked so far and they just received it so well so I got accolades and really good news about that so everything is going really well and I guess I kind of recap the week as well I kind of like working from home I need to order like a seat rest in the backrest I think that's the only thing that's like preventing me to be like a hundred percent from working from home but myself that bad the body works not Bath & Body Works Bed Bath & Beyond was they had some stuff online that might be the best place to order and have it shipped in my house because they are closed right now I did see that but I think you could still buy stuff off their website but any you today was a really great day and then also this week was a really great week I actually really like working from home I get a lot of stuff done I can take my time and also I can just get up and kind of just do like a refresher you can drink all my water it's just a really good I feel focused I feel motivated even though sometimes throughout the week I was a little agitated from just being a stir crazy from working at home for all it was a really really great work week and today me and my mom went to the park after work because she's off due to like the virus she works at the hospital so they're doing like switching shifts so she is off today Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday go back Wednesday after I got for work today we went and walked and one of the the most gorgeous parks we have here in Memphis we just walked around we did about two miles all the way around the front lake park so I showed you guys some clips of that but it was just so good to get out the house and get in some sunshine then after that we went to Target but also throughout the day on my lunch break I edited our engagement video which me and Kendall filmed yesterday so I'm almost done I just need to add like the fun bits of like clips that I actually got from the actual engagement day so that's what I'm about to do tonight and then next week I probably won't blog I'll probably just end up doing like an outfits video because I plan on doing a lot of like at home like work business casual outfits of the week so when me and my mom were out of course we went to Target after we left the park and it was so bare inside there was no one in there of course I really needed to return one of my travel backpacks that I bought from open story which is like one of their like luxury brands inside of Target but they can't accept returns until April the 16th so I'm going to take it back because if our trip was delayed I want to see if I can find a better backpack for a cheaper cost because that backpack was really expensive in it's just been sitting there I'm like I I need to take it back because I want to find something a little different than that but also I need to just get some shrimp we need to get a few things in the house as well so we went to Target um since we're already out came back showered and you guys saw all of that but I want to show you guys two new pieces we'll do a little target haul so maybe I'll show I'll show the journal first so way that I say organizers will add work is by prepping the day before so without going into too much detail I prepped like who I need to contact the next day or who I have contacted in journals so I'm almost done with my beautiful journal that I got when I first started work I actually got it from TJ Maxx but TJ Maxx is closed during the virus outbreak so since target was open in their stationary which I never do I saw this little cheap journal it was 1099 but they were on sale for $3 and it's just a good way for me to continue to keep track of all of my work while working from home because I'm almost finished with my daily journal that I use every single day it was my training binder for like was on a binder but my training spiral when I went to headquarters when I first started and so I have like maybe a few more weeks left in it I wanted to get a backup one so I can be prepared when I finished with that one and then also you guys know I love kiss nails so I actually have some on right now for my birthday me and my mom did get our nails like shellac but my shellac lasted for three days which is crazy for the amount of money you pay for it and I was like I'm never going there again so I love kiss nails it's something that I've been using like since I've been working so for the past four or five months it's just a great way if you're like on the go these are like five or six dollars and you they stay on for like nine or ten days so the amount you pay you can get a brand new set of nails every single week and be cute and it still won't be as much as getting your nails done Laurens so these are like my new ones that I put on for this week because they looked really pretty with my engagement ring so when we're at Target I got some more but I feel like I need to order some online because they have a lot of really really cute nails but I always see these red ones so I decided to get the red ones with like a little sparkle and glitter so I'm probably and then putting these on tomorrow and tomorrow's blog and then I also got these so these are ones they don't have like the jail jelly on the back of them which is what I really like you have to actually like glue these on but I just love this like soft buff color so I might try these out as well we'll see I'll try out one of them in tomorrow's blog but I always see these and I never get themselves like let me try these out since I can do it and of course I got some clothes so I got a new dress and it's actually by Universal Britt which is such a as such a gorgeous brand inside of target this dress was actually 30 bucks and I love like the way that it's made and all the muted colors because my favorite colors are like these are muted like they almost look like fall colors but I just love them so much like the greens and these like Brit colors and gray so that's like the style that I've been going into right now but I felt this gorgeous dress and it's so pretty I got it in a size small and like I said it was 30 bucks but it hits it a good length and it's just such a pretty summer dress so I'm trying to get more dresses for this year so I can wear dresses for the summertime so I've been collecting all this year especially like sales stuff in the winter you can get so many gorgeous dresses which is what I've been doing but this is like new stuff that they just came out for their spring line so I might end up doing like a video of showing like styling target outfits for a week because all of my business professional clothes are pretty much from Target and I love them so the other thing that I got were these really pretty high-waisted wide legged pants because you guys so I love wild like a pants these are in a size two things have fitted at the hip relaxed thigh widest leg and they were also $30 as well and they're by universal thread but I just love their like a really nice khaki and they're just gonna be so breathable to wear to work in the summertime because Memphis has such humid summers then also just like wearing around out and about so I may actually wear those tomorrow because I've got a lot of fun things that I'm gonna do like at the house that I need to get like organized and then later on me and can move in and hang out and watch church because all of church services are online now so yeah I might wear those we hang out but I am going to end the vlog off right here you guys I hope you enjoyed my first week of being engaged it still hasn't hit me yet but oh I can show you guys before my memory card clears out but today as well I designed this but if it doesn't focus I designed this today on my lunch break as well so I'll just put it over the screen because it wasn't focusing but it just hasn't hit me yet me and my mom were talking about like bun wedding stuff just like talking and seeing like what we want but we had some really good ideas so has it hit me but I'm really really excited but I hope you guys enjoyed this work week in my life and all the exciting things are going on if you did make
