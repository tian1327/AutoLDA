 without human interaction when you live alone it's hard I took a shower get myself a little blowout my hair's fresh it smells good too today I'm gonna be doing some cleaning and preparation for Jude to come home from his dad's or from his grandma's house I'm gonna put some boxes in my garage throw out the trash right now I'm currently working on load three of laundry editing of course I'm still trying to debate whether or not I should do a vlog and a regular content upload on the same day because I just don't want either of the videos to do poorly and then also I've noticed a drop in subscribers it's like a drop and a game like at the same time so it's kind of steady there's no real growth because of the uploads so I don't know if I have like a new audience or my writers are like what the hell are you doing with all these quarantine videos so I successfully uploaded seven days in a row and I'm thinking maybe I should start doing per week hmm I just have so many ideas I mean my noodle is definitely working right now because of all the time that I have I have to build that trampoline today is my baby girl's third birthday so I heard her daycare is gonna be opening up soon because it is a hardship on a lot of parents who still have to go to work includes my little sister she has to go back to work because my sister works for a printing company and according to the CDC it's essential just like Starbucks is essential I don't understand that one listen I love good Starbucks okay don't get me wrong the girls know me over there as a regular but I just don't feel like Starbucks is essential make her freakin coffee at home you lazy batch I'm not my period anymore guys I'm just aggressive my bad as I mentioned earlier it is my goddaughter Aubrey the smaller one she's turning 3 today and everybody is obviously at home so what we're gonna do is set up a group chat at least sing happy birthday to her I haven't seen my family in over a week and that's really weird because we all live within at least a 20 minute radius of each other and and we're super close I talked to my sisters and my mom every single day and I texted my brother quite often so yeah we're pretty close to each other and I feel weird not spending any time with them so I hope we can go back to normal as soon as possible but I'm so excited I got a little glimpse of seeing them and that's why my energy kind of picked up so hopefully I can record that for you guys obviously the camera quality is way different don't get spoiled guys I'm still going to use my phone or hopefully use a different camera that's in this bin down here just like a bunch of old cameras in there that I have to dust off and charge up it's unrealistic to use this head the DSLR I'm hoping you guys can see everybody I'm just waiting for them to call happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear Aubree happy birthday to you yay good job Aubrey a little update Jude is actually going to come back tomorrow evening instead of tonight he usually comes back on Tuesday evenings at 7 o'clock but since his dad took two weeks off of work I'm going to need this assistance so it helps me out a lot too because I get things done around here I typically have Jude five days and his dad hasn't to starting this week he'll be with his dad three days and then he'll be with me the rest of the time so it works out it helps me a lot I know it's just like one extra day but hey one extra day on quarantine was crazy as kids that's a big deal well yesterday I had margaritas to go what you guys saw and you haven't asleep so I was editing my vlog today and I uploaded it today so you know a little bit behind quarantine life it's fine but I was able to wrap some gifts for the kids and place them into this box and I'm going to deliver them but I'm waiting for my Amazon guide to come by so that I don't leave anything on my doorstep now that everybody is home so I also read on the news that we could possibly go into like complete shutdown so right now we're on a lockdown I think it's going to be escalated to a 2-week shut-in where everybody like has to stay in their houses tons of people are hitting the street taking walks going on hikes going to the beach the governor already announced that we have military presence at the beach they closed them down they also closed down the major hiking trails I'm not sure about this city because we have a few in our neighboring city of Glendora here in Azusa - in the canyons they have several different hiking trails that you can take I mean I don't think anybody's gonna want to stay at the gate and regulate how many people are out there to make sure that we are practicing proper social distancing it's not gonna happen today it was a beautiful day whole day but beautiful day and I know it's gonna rain again I need to take these boxes over to the garage okay yeah there's Amazon got a few packages days are so long I forgot what I even ordered so I'm gonna be surprised so the is the book that I got dude he's working on book number two so I think this is book three I believe so hopefully he can pass his eight hour test here soon and then I'll hand him over this guy another item I got was this track organizer so pretty much this is going to hang in the inside of this door it's like my whole closet door oh yeah I know it's a hot mess you guys this is why I have to clean it out I know right now don't judge me I'm gonna fix it I'm gonna fix it break it I'm doing this of course without any direction which is not smart how the Frick do you do this I don't get it how the Frick does this work I don't understand you're right I'll read the instructions I can hear some of you okay and then what both persons there's only one of me oh my god you guys I wanted to step on it and like oh I was right has step on it okay okay alright that was really easy to do actually after I started reading the directions this would probably only take you maybe five minutes to put together all right well these myself the only thing left to do is put the bars on here so she can jump and hold on so she doesn't go flying off so a special shout out and happy birthday are celebrating birthdays during this time I'm so sorry okay my birthday your are you ready okay let's see you jump got your socks okay yeah and then you could hold on here hold onto here and you can jump with it hold hold onto it and joke joke joke joke yeah jumping yeah oh you missed it very saying that they're gonna make it up a plan to try to end all the domestic flights right now to know why even in the country oh my goodness I know that you where's Audrey at we're gonna rock we go I don't know where are we with is that you yeah you're dressed like I'm in love it look about feed the flock yeah you wanna see us get it girl get it girl there's my girl she's jumping ant ant ant   you not the Rona I have no brawn that's hot these will go skyrocketing hey baby baby if you don't bring your balls down here shouldn't be here but think like the cool side ever see you Shirley fine 6 a.m. I made it back from visiting I know let's no no sorry guys but this wouldn't be like real-life vlogging if I didn't include things like that in this situation because it is hard I haven't seen my family in a long time they were saying that they haven't seen anyone or gone outside for a long time so it was just nice to even hug them for a little bit even if it was just for a second I was there not even 10 minutes I just wanted to drop off their gifts and take off really miss my family and birthdays are really big for us too so obviously that's why we go on that call together tomorrow I think I'm going to be listing some more stuff I'm a posh mark so hopefully you guys can check that out and reorganizing the space behind me to see if I can really turn it into like a working warehouse trying to stay positive because without human interaction when you live alone it's hard it'll mess up your like psyche it'll mess up your mental health I know I'm gonna be criticized for leaving the house but I needed my family like I needed my medication today so as I had my short meetings with my family today it's hitting everybody in different ways I know my family is okay but I know there's a lot of families out there who are not okay so we just are staying so present and so grateful and I'm ready for day ten let's do it see you guys tomorrow
