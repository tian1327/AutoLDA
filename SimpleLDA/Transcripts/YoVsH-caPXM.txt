 morning is now 5 00 am i just woke up and let's go play with my kitten and get some breakfast all right so we're making my smoothie and my cat always comes in the kitchen whenever i'm in there so here's my little van here's a little frankie hi hi but we're going to show you how to make a video strawberry banana smoothie you can add whatever else you want i use trivani yogurt that's just because stop sleep all right but um i just used chobani yogurt in my one thing of blender just because frankie hold on i'll be right back back ahead go punish my cat except for he's coming back at the moment um basically dump it out if you can as much as you can and then grab your spoon and scrape it all the sides out in here what did you just do oh my god in a second um but basically i'm just i just do this and then have something whether maybe or i just need it on it once you get it all the way over down i'm gonna go pick up that broom that look hat but i just knocked over that's not for you to play with no it's not it's not a play toys you know i can't get it now see let's see you get it i'm sorry if that had taken a little bit but anyways then i get like frozen instead of buying straight up banana or straight up frozen bananas or frozen strawberry banana mixture i will first add strawberries  another just big fruit mixture and i think i'm also gonna add some bananas so up here i have my a little bat a big bag of little bags of banana so that way every time i have a smoothie i just grab one of these and boom that's my servings make sure the bags of your little bananas like just chop them up but then we make sure they are still tight we're gonna add some pineapple some peaches and some english there is also strawberries but i've already added strawberry so i'm not gonna add any more i just want this to be a little bit more trouble than usual so now we're gonna add our bananas and then we're gonna add some milk and then we're gonna blend her up drink  i'll be making my delicious smoothie so far not done yet do you have fewer pieces now all i have to do is add the milk add as much milk as you want if you want a thinner thanks movie and also if you don't like i advise if you're having this movie try and get one of the flavors that you're gonna put in if you have to use like giovanni or something like already made yogurt so that way it doesn't taste weird with having a pomegranate yogurt inside your smoothie and then we add a little bit of milk it's probably gonna be really thick anyway so i'm gonna see you once this is blended this is a quarantine vlog one i hope you guys are liking it so far but i want to show you how i set up my blender i have one small little like it's like a one serving blender thing that i just add all the ingredients you just stick around why am i adding this i don't know because i'm weird but it also i'm bored so we got that and when i'm done blending it up pretty thick never mind i'm not using that cup to drink out of it because i was gonna smooth trim spoon now as you can see it's very thick so we're gonna put this in a bowl it's coming really chips stupid there we go yeah that's more like it um and we're going to add a few pieces of things maybe a few chunks of watermelon onto it and boom yeah you're smooth get every little bit of it out oh god okay well i'll see you and i get it all out hold it up there's only a little bit but i can't get out with my spoon sorry guys trying to hear that girl with that noise for 5-10 seconds but here we have our delicious looking oh i spilt some butt delicious looking smoothie bowl and after this we'll take a shower and get changed for the day so let's go quickly i rinsed out the coffee now there's like a little bit left now we have our delicious looking smoothie bowl right there oh my god i almost dropped my phone in there that scared me but basically beautiful great smoothie bowl should probably clean that part up just cuz and so now we're gonna have to decorate it with watermelon and i don't know i think we only have red watermelon and kiwi so we'll get some kiwi too okay so i have some watermelon here and i have kiwis i think i'm gonna go with watermelon just because i'm not as big of a fan as kiwis than watermelon so i might do maybe a slice of candy or something i don't know mostly just this though so i'm gonna take this and do it we're gonna put a slice of watermelon chop it up my cutting board cutting board so basically we're just gonna grab a piece let's cut this guy i'll be back do you guys wanna wanna watch me cook uh how do you guys think of me starting a gaming channel would you guys go subscribe would you not i don't really care i would like you to but that's your decision it's not mine but honestly you're
