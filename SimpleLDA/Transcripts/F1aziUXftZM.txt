  everyone welcome back to my channel so today is Saturday and this is going to be my moving vlog the way that it worked out like I have furniture in the new place like I have like a bed and like a dresser and stuff because the girl that I'd like a lease takeover type thing and so the girl was like I can leave my furniture if you want and then I was like okay sounds good so she left that and so like I got rid of my stuff which I did like a while ago like I've been sleeping on an air mattress for like over a week which is fine I honestly don't mind it that much like it's kind of comfortable but um yeah so okay warning my room is a mess okay but there's like no furniture in here anymore because I got rid of all that and so now I'm like trying to like get everything together so the closet is like empty I already moved all of the clothes out I did like a first trip like I'm on like a Monday or something like earlier in the week I did like my like first round of moving everything and then now I'm kind of like moving the rest of the stuff but it's like hard because I don't have boxes and I don't even think like like Home Depot or like wherever you would get boxes like I don't think they're open because like in Seattle it's like all non-essential businesses are closed so I'm pretty sure that like stuff like Lowe's and Home Depot would like not be open and plus I'm like trying to like not like go out if I don't have to so I'm packing and stuff like this like duffel bags and then like I have like another one there and then I'm like putting stuff in like laundry baskets and stuff so it's not ideal but we're making it work and so I think I'm gonna like do another trip up stuff it's also complicated because okay I don't know if I want to like bore you with this whole story but no right maybe I'll tell you later but yeah it's just like a big process right now I'm like trying to like pack up my car so I can do another trip and like the stuff that I left there this weekend or like on Monday or whatever it's just like thrown on the bed so this is gonna be like part moving and then part like organizing and yeah but the first step is to just get everything there and then I figured once like I have everything I can more like figure out where to put things but yeah so wish me luck we're a one-man team today but well and all weeks we're gonna make it worked out it'll be okay okay so packed up my car also I feel like I look orange I all my makeup is like packed up and so I just used the foundation that was like easiest to grab and because I was like Oh since I'm filming a video I'll do my makeup and now I just wish I didn't because I think I look orange but that's fine I'm about to drink this kombucha it's like tropical punch health aid brand Pisa oh it tastes to oranjee I hate oranges so that was a fail I need to stop trying new kombucha flavors because I don't like them I like ice news stick to what I know but okay that was the least efficient way to like move ever like this is such a struggle and like okay this is gonna be my second trip I'm gonna show you everything in a second so you can see how pathetic of a moving job this is but I did like I said earlier I did one trip before and then I'm gonna do this trip and then I think I'm gonna do one more trip but it also just gets like overwhelming when I'm like in my room and I'm like getting like overwhelmed with like bringing stuff in like the fact I don't of boxes I'm not I'm not gonna complain because I'm honestly killing am doing such a good job I'm so proud of myself I really want him out and do I was like I want soda i freakin deserve it I've been doing so well I'm not good I love soda like that's like my favorite treat so that's why I thought that I would have this kombucha but it's definitely not doing it for me oh you guys can't see I keep Jesus I drop it's so dark this clip is a mess okay let me show you my job it's so bad okay I'm like packing in like Trader Joe's bags like this is pathetic I have a table here there's like a bunch of stuff back here I'm also like what am I supposed to do with all my stuff because I'm moving from like an apartment where I can like use the hall closet and stuff to a house with like seven people and I'm like I have like sleeping bags a tent - like this is kind of a struggle but we're gonna make it work it's gonna be okay that's what I keep telling myself if I keep saying that a million times in this video it's cuz I'm trying to convince myself so yeah okay let's go to the house now I guess okay this is like the prime example of why I have to do it in like portions because this is just like extremely overwhelming and this room is like small it does have like a lot of storage like this closet is like a decent size and then you can put stuff up here then I have this dresser and then this thing it's like built-in and it's kind of like just like storage and there's more storage down here so I think it'll be fine to like do it like put all this stuff away but it is just like very overwhelming like when you first get in here so I think what I'm first gonna do is just like put it like all these clothes were things that I packed on like my first trip and like duffle bags and like suitcases and stuff and then I literally just like threw them on the bed so I'm gonna try to like organize those and put those in like dresser drawers and yeah I don't know that's probably does it all start with and then after I do that I can like figure it out more but we just gotta take like baby steps otherwise this is like very overwhelming but I do like this room like it does have like a lot of like light there's like these two windows right in front then like the bed she left me this TV that's like mounted so like that's like perfect above the bed and then I like all the storage and stuff so I'm going to tackle this whole mess first     okay I made a ton of progress like this whole bed was like covered and like everything on the floor is like gone and yeah it's still like a mess over here but I just had like away like less like space I think is like the issue because before I had my own bathroom and then I also had like a hall closet but I'll probably end up like once I'm finished moving like putting like that tent and like those sleeping bags like in like the trunk of my car like kind of like indefinitely or something because there's not really oh we're under my bed actually is a really good idea I'll put those under my bed but yeah it's still like kind of like messy but we made a lot of progress so but I'm so hungry I need to go get food and then I'm going back to my apartment and like sleeping there tonight and probably try to like pack up like the rest of the stuff yeah cuz like I said this is like a process it's like taking like several steps but that's fine I'm gonna like get something to eat well I have to a grocery shopping so maybe of course you're shopping I don't know I have to figure it out but yeah I made a lot of progress so I'm very happy okay so it's Sunday afternoon now and I just drove over to the new house did you like my last little trip of things and it honestly wasn't that much stuff but it was some stuff that like I saved like a lot of like random or like delicate stuff towards the end like back here I have like some picture frames and stuff and then I have stuff in the trunk and then up here had like plants and they totally just like fell everywhere I'm gonna have to like clean that up when I bring it inside but yeah this actually wasn't that bad I thought I was gonna have a lot more stuff today and I just like don't so this should be a pretty quick trip and I did most of my organizing yesterday so I really am killing it I said that yesterday but I'm like I'm doing this all by myself and I'm doing a very good job so I'm very proud but yeah I'm just gonna bring all this stuff in and then kind of like set it up in the new room and maybe I'll like show you like the finished product but it's definitely not like a finished product thing I'm not like completely like decorating like organizing and like honestly the girl before me the walls there's like so many holes in them she left a bunch of nails and I was like like I don't know maybe it was like that when she moved in that's how like a lot of the houses are like oh I don't even know if I ever explained it so I already lived in Seattle and then I'm moving to like I used to live in Magnolia and now I'm moving to the University District because I'm like taking over someone's lease and so a lot of like the house is in the university district like are like Kotler like all like college kids like live there and they're like not the best like taking care of honestly like it was the same way I used to live in Bellingham and I lived in like a like a college house with a bunch of people and people just like don't really like take care of it so I don't even know if she put all those holes in the wall or if someone else did but yeah it's it could use some work but I'm probably not even gonna like worry about like decorating or anything right now I'm like I see got all my stuff in here and like I'm feel accomplished for just moving like decorating that's like another that's another day but yeah so I'm just gonna like bring all this stuff inside now okay that honestly wasn't much progress to like show on the room because I just like moved everything into the room and then put some stuff away and pretty much like it's the same as it did yesterday so there wasn't that much to show for that but I'm back at my apartment now and I'm so hungry I'm about to make dinner and okay I'm gonna make this just like a frozen meal and it's like they're like vegan it's basically just like a chicken alfredo with broccoli and spinach except it's like all vegan so I've never had this before but like I have like this brand if I want like fake chicken nuggets or like I don't know any sort of like fake frozen stuff from the grocery store but yeah I'm about to make this I'll show you what it looks like because I feel like it's gonna be really good cuz that photo looks really good so I thought it was gonna be like an alfredo but I just reread the bag and it said creamy garlic lemon sauce so I think it's more like a scampi sauce but it looks really good alright so now it's gonna make it for this video I'm just gonna eat my dinner take a shower and just like chill out for the rest of the night but thank you so much for watching and I will see you next video bye
