  hey everyone and welcome back to the channel and welcome to a new vlog it's been a while since I've blogged so I thought why not pick up the camera today we're now in so I think week eight or nine of quarantine and so I thought why not show you what our quarantine days look like and also like share some updates with you guys it is Tuesday and it's late morning now I've already done all of my kind of morning routine as you saw already so got off made my bed did some yoga which I've actually been really enjoying I've been doing like these videos that are usually only like between 10 and 20 minutes and I've really been enjoying them so I link actually some of the ones I'm doing daily below in the description box in case you're wondering and then I just got ready as you can see I'm planning on shooting some stuff today so that's why I have so much makeup on and my hair done and then I just got my breakfast there which was overnight oats and some green tea so that's what my morning has looked like and now I'm gonna clean off the situation here get ready to shoot some stuff because the weather is actually really nice today and the lights got in here so I'm gonna try and patch you some content and then I also some work on my laptop to get to so yeah that's my next plan of action David is here with me of course and so we're probably gonna cook a nice lunch and stuff and dinner too so yeah it's just gonna be a normal day for us this is usually what we get off to every day during quarantine and I thought you might enjoy it I'm really enjoying seeing what people are getting after so hopefully it won't be too boring and yeah I'll try and document as much as possible and I'll check in with you again soon ok so this is the first outfit I'm attempting to shoot today I actually got this dress for a trip to Miami the hen I went to actually but I never ended up shooting it so I'm gonna try and get some shots today and yeah I'm gonna set up in this little corner here I've moved my mirror and I have this white sheet that I'm gonna try and set up because I just want something super plane and this is the corner and I got the best mic so I'll show you how I do that now oh and also this dress is just more random shop in New York I actually can't remember the name but it's one of those brand shops and so it was really $40.00 and it's actually really nice and the quality is really good so I'll try and find some similar options and link them below I might even be able to find this exact one maybe if I check the tags it might got a different slice it's the brand in the beginning so yeah I never know I'll have a look for you and I'll put anything I can find in the description box  wanna shake that round wanna break away the booze I'm tired of waiting but I made on the neon signs okay first you've done that was actually super quick and I got a few nice shots I think hopefully fingers crossed so I'm back and comfy clothes out because I'm gonna leave this set off Pierre but I liked actually not as good as I hope so I'm gonna wait until it gets better it usually gets better in about an hour or so so I'm gonna in the meantime do some work on my laptop and I'm gonna edit some photos and post on my Instagram so I'm going to go do some of that admin stuff now get some of that dawn and I'm actually gonna make lunch as well soon because I'm so hungry that breakfast did not really fill me this morning I told a boy but yeah gonna do some of that and probably make lunch pretty soon so I'll show you what I'm making I think one I have a wrap and I actually had a coffee yesterday either which is very weird for me trying to not have it as early in the day because for the last few weeks I've been having it like first thing in the morning and then having like two or three more throughout the day so I think the longer I push out the first one the less like him to have another one and another one so that's I'm trying to but first admin to me okay so I'm gonna have some wraps we always get these ones from Trader Joe's they are called habanero blowing flour tortillas they're actually so so nice but they I refined spicy so be wary and then I'm just gonna use some turkey David's already had something to eat but he's kind of hungry again so I'm gonna make him one too I'm gonna just make these 50 now and I'll fill in for the time that I'll make some coffee  do something tonight and there we go lunch or to Raffy and some coffee each other the bended coffee and then I made David a caramel latte and yeah this is such a quick and easy lunch idea just a raft way turkey onion avocado and when I was in a cheese mayo and sweet chili sauce so really easy and quick and delicious okay lunch is really nice and I was able to shoot some more with lovely light as you saw and we had such a lovely sunset again this evening so we're actually just gonna run out for a walk my camera battery just died so I'm gonna leave that charging while we're gone and it's gonna be dark soon so we'll try and get some steps in before the day it's over again these things go so fast but I'll bring you along in the walk anyway   and we're back that was really nice it's actually such a nice evening it's a bit warmer than yesterday but not too warm it's like that perfect time when we're going from spring to somewhere where the weather is just perfect before it gets old so hot and so we're trying to enjoy it as much as we can about to make dinner now best time of the day David has just started now but before I'm going to help him I just thought I'd show you this tracksuit once more I forgot to tell you a little bit about it before we went on the walk I got this on Amazon a couple of weeks ago I shared it on my Instagram story so you might have seen it already but it's from a really affordable brand called Hanes and I've literally lived in it since I got it so I thought I'd share it with you here as well it's a little bit oversized I do regret not getting the pants in a smaller size but honestly it's real comfort I think it was only maybe $10 for the pants and $12 for the top so so good I'll link it below wax you just start at the top and point today and this is the small but I ordered at the point in the medium just to give it a little bit of a more oversized I got the pants too big and the top too small typical I also have my new runners on like they are the Nike Air Force low stage I think their calls showed them on my og stories as well but I thought I'd show them to you here I'm really liking them i additionally haven't taken them off since I got them and so I'll link them as well down below and I'm sorry the lights are amazing right now it's just getting dark but just wants to show you that really quick so I had to go make dinner now I wonder what he's making please ignore the boxes we're tearing suppose how are you getting on I'm gonna help ya the government we are doing chicken Athene ordering zucchini noodles these are no feeder from Trader Joe's and parents for the chicken walks you're gonna make them into little chicken goo John's so we usually just dip the chicken in the egg and hosted in all Cesar flagons oh and it's so nice I've showed this on my Instagram stories I have the recipe in a highlight but a short here is well how would you it I'll pop the camera off and you can see okay I could keep a few out there to show you how I do the homemade chicken blue John's kind of healthy version of them David had all those stuff on so I was getting photography so I'll make a brief but all you need is your chicken and so I have one chicken breasts all diced up we have one egg in a bowl there's much of dip the chicken into and then you have your own you can also use breadcrumbs I'm guessing but I like to use alternate they're a bit of a healthier option and then I also mix in some garlic powder with the old so I just think it adds a little bit of flavor and then all you basically do is your chicken you John dip it in the egg dip it in the hole and just make sure it's fully fully covered and it's going to look like this sorry dependency that now and then get it on your tray that's pretty much it so it's super easy so I will just go ahead and do the rest these now and I'll make sure to show your self like I see em   result so that's how the chicken looks when they come out of the oven and then we just had some broccoli in the carrots zucchini and sweet potato mash speculative dinner definitely one of our more healthy options but those chicken nuggets are actually so nice they make you feel like you're almost having a bit of a takeaway and they make the healthy stuff seem a little bit nicer so definitely recommend to try them out I'll put the recipe in the description box just in case you missed it okay that was really delicious actually the zucchini noodles weren't as nice as usual I think they were a little big enough we tried to pretend like they weren't but they were I think but the rest was so so nice oh I love the chicken go John's with the sweet potato mash it's so good together and now I'm just watching some Hollywood on Netflix I'm not sure if many people know about it yet I haven't seen that much about it but it's actually really good I'm on the last episode now but it's about like Hollywood in the 1940s so yeah probably not the best thing I've watched on Netflix I watched Waco last week and that was very good another thing I loved during quarantine was this is us but that's not on Netflix that's what on Hulu as far as I know um but yeah I think I'm all washed out to be honest I love watching stuff I love watching shows I love watching movies so I have no problem binging shows I get through things very quickly so then we know down in the comments if there's anything that you like so far that I haven't seen yet and now I'm just having a little bit of dessert I have this ice cream from Trader Joe's it's the large ice cream and it's actually really nice cookies and cream 120 310 calories in the table so that's not too bad and so I think we're going to go to bed now soon it's already getting ready for bed I'm wrecked I don't know why but I'm gonna go in now and take off my makeup and I'll actually show you guys what I used to take off my makeup while I'm at it I was gonna do my eyebrows tonight but I might wait till tomorrow but I'll show you the other thing I was going to use for that too so but let me just finish this off and I'll bring you into the bathroom with me okay we've made it to the bathroom into the end of the day I don't see the days are going so fast I just looked at my top there and I was like how is it that's why I'm already are you finding the day's going fast probably because we're just literally living like the same day every single day but yeah it's time to finally take off this makeup I feel like it is on for way too long it's at that stage now where it feels like your key so the first thing I like to do when I have a full face of makeup on is use my balm for just like erasing everything basically and this is the one from pesavum monitor it's a makeup removing bomb I think it's just called a race that's the actual name of it but I'll link it below that's the first thing I like to use and I basically just spread that all over it gets kind of messy beware so do have your little like baseballs ready and I just go straight in please take your lumps of the crazy hair and the crazy nails they really need for you read on I'm kind of putting it off because I know it takes a while but I probably won't have to do it this week I do the powder again in case you missed that video I showed you how I do powder nails they actually did last really well though I think they're probably on probably three weeks or a month no and yeah as you can see this that if she just mess everything away and you can really get in there and the eyes as well which I like and a person I was kind of afraid to do that cuz I was afraid that it would irritate them but it doesn't and it gets rid of the makeup so quickly I guess I also want to use this time to have a bit of a chat with you guys about quarantine and how you're getting on beginning to get real I mean I know it's been real for a while now but I don't know the last week or so I've felt it more I don't know why but all along I just felt like you know I was handling the whole situation quite well I think is because my didn't like change a crazy amount at the beginning you know I work from home a lot anyway and I was still you know working with Erica a lot so I didn't interrupt my life too much but it's definitely starting to take its toll now and especially because of our living arrangements you know we live in a studio apartment and David's here constantly every single day and I'm here most days as well besides the coping of our words like over to Erica's every now I'm again so yeah I think that situation was getting to be and honestly like I feel like an indeed even saying that because we're very lucky to have an apartment to stay in right now I'm afraid of heat in so many different ways but I think it's just when I'm on the phone to my mom and stuff and I see her and she's out in the garden and she has she's in the house and able to move around a bit more and and she just doesn't have to worry about meeting people if she wants to go up for a walk or whatever you know my house at home and Ireland in the countryside and I think it's just when I see that I'm like oh I would love to have that for a while now but other than that you know what we can't complain you're always going to have your bad days and I think it's all about just keeping busy and distracting yourself and making lists like being productive for me getting things done and like taking things off lists that I've been making has helped me and distracted me days and I still would love to go home at some stage we keep like having the discussion every day and we both would love to for a while obviously it's tricky to know right now we should have been in Ireland this week we had work we originally had a wedding in Ireland this week so should be caring right now but yeah we've been coming hauling about it obviously you can't really make any decisions right now because there's still the travel ban so you can't actually get into the u.s. from Ireland right now so if we did decide to go in the morning we don't know when we'd be coming back and obviously as well it's a huge risk to go to airports right now and like leave New York and go to Ireland because New York is such a hot spot first so obviously all of that is take to account as well and we have no plans of booking any flights anytime soon but we'd like to talk about this we're hoping at some stage we'll be able to go and just stay there for a while maybe and just for like a bit more normality even though I don't know what it is but like the more I'm staying at home during quarantine the more I'd like to be at home does anyone else feel like that I actually I sound crazy saying that even out loud and I feel like I'm almost gonna find it hard to adjust back to nothing home as much and I know what five minutes ago I was sleeping I thought I'd be stuck at home all day but I don't know I just I'm not forgetting so comfortable with this new routine as well at the same time it's like it's gonna be almost weird I'm a bit of an introvert anyway so I think that's probably playing into a - sorry it's something stuck in my eye but yeah I don't know I just feel like tone I'm having to like pack a bag and leave this parent now not knowing when I'd be coming back to it like gives me the fear and I'm sure it's like all my head obviously and if I got to my house and I wouldn't even think of my apartment here but yeah I don't know please tell me someone else feels like that and this conversation after going way longer than I wants to do I'm sorry about that I'm gonna finish taking off my makeup now and I'll check back in and say goodbye to you guys because I can't honestly stay here talking to you all night on getting all this stuff off my chest so yeah I'll be right back and that is my skin after that every spam did the trick it works really fast as you can see from my face so and what I've got to show you as well the next thing I like to usually do I usually go in with another cleanser which is this Obagi one this is what I'm using right now I've been using this for a while now when I really like it it's very very gentle on the skin this brand is really well and Dawn actually I didn't really know them that well up until a couple months ago when I went to an event and we got this in the goodie bag and I remember looking it up online and the reviews were really really good so I started using it so I usually just put a light layer of that on next and wash that off again the same way I did the bomb with the face towel and they'd like to go at my serum and run right now I'm using this hyaluronic acid from pestle and mortar and I just stuff that all over wanna keep things quite simple tonight because I'm feeling a bit hazy but yeah this is usually my next step I think I'd like to do is I cream and I'm using this one at the moment from skinceuticals this one's called the eye balm and again I definitely use different eye creams more science of the week but I like this one at the moment it's quite nice the texture of it it's right like thick almost so it feels like it's really doing something you don't mean and feels very hydrating and I just like to pop that all the way down under at this stage that I like to go in with a mace to pick up and I'm using the hydrating baseness from dr. Barbara Sturm I think that's how you pronounce it and I was using this at the end of my skin carrier I'm all along but really I've been using before my wife's dryer and actually really liked it I just think it like soaks into the skin better if you don't have your moisturizer on yet so I just spray that all over I'm neck to and then last but not least I'm gonna do some moisturizer and smells I think I'm going to use the Kia's super multi corrective cream I've been using this a lot in the morning time and I really like it so I'm gonna pop it on tonight like all between this one a lot and I go between 10 an edge sleeping mask I really really like that I'll show it to you now there it's just in a blue container this is really nice it's like a really nice consistency not too thick but taking off to feed it you know but it also feels a bit like offering a nice way just like soaks into the skin really nicely and I like to focus start like right around my nose because that's a super joy area for me and then I also bring it down to my neck it is that an HDPE mask in case you're wondering it's called the warhorse sleeping mask really liked that one too and oh I nearly forgot my actual last step is my lineage lip mask this is called the lips leaping mask and I have it in Barry I used this every night as well before I go to bed this is one never skip because I've such dry lips so I just pop that all over I'm very generous with it that's so long this is such a popular product I think so many people buying this during quarantine especially so I linked up a toll-free if you want to check it out it comes in lots of different flavors as well I think the vanilla one is like their original and I think I'm pretty much done what's going to tie my eyebrows and show you that but I think I'm going to leave it because they're actually not as long as I thought they were so I might push it out another few days but I will try and finish for you at some stage and I think it might be too short for a YouTube video so I was thinking I want to do it on Instagram maybe as like stories and like save it as a highlight so let me know if you want to see that I will show you the product that I use this is the one I've been using the last few times I beg my bros it's the colors for 30 day brow tint I've got the shade black because I like my brows to be super dark because they do fake like wick so I think it's better to go darker sometimes I haven't seen this one or not online but I have seen either one a lot I actually think it was on sale on a sauce the other day so I linked that as well I've used that in the past as well we really liked it it's just harder to get these products over here and in the store so I usually get them in Ireland I think this was the one that I found on my last trip but the earlier one is really good too and with that being said I think I'm gonna finish off the video here and go to bed I hope you enjoyed this little vlog I know it wasn't too exciting and nothing crazy happened but this is reality this is our quarantine and so I hope you found it somewhat entertaining let me know if you do like these style videos the one I can definitely try and do more and we've plenty time right now to be filming so I can also include like different segments like the skincare I just did there I could maybe do you know makeup or fashion or something along those lines are more baking and cooking maybe yeah just let me know in the comments and until then don't forget to give the video a thumbs up if you did like it subscribe to my channel if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
