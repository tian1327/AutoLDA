 welcome to 2020 so the last time I posted a video on here was years ago haha lots changed since then I said in that video that I was posting them and BRB so in that video I said that I was posting well I wanted to post things that just for myself I'm just post videos for myself and so I could look back on and you know kind of just see where I was in life and things like that  three years later I am lazy for certain things like super I've realized that about myself super super lazy for certain things making videos opposing them is one of them and it's just I don't know I would decided to live my life instead of document every single moment of it for the most part because I still post on like Instagram and stuff like that so there's that but yeah here we are fast forward to 2020 and is unreal like I'm super super thankful that even if you know I'm somebody who's asymptomatic that I have felt healthy and that for the most part people in my life have been healthy and staying safe so that is great news and I'm very thankful for that it's just weird time like you can't go about life the same right now or even for a while after this I've pretty much gotten used to you know anytime you touch something anytime you come home from something like it's just crazy that it has to be that tactical it's really weird it's it's weird and and it made me anxious at first like I hated going grocery shopping because I'm like I have to remember like every single part of my body that I Tosh so I can sanitize it I'll just like take a shower when I get home and this is not and it's just like it's wearing like the second one and it's it's just like this is what it is now it this is what it is now and for who knows how long so clearly limited on things to do at the moment so hearing okay so here's what I don't have patience for these things or to do them that often I just flipped my camera because this way the steering wheel is not in my face because I'm short so it's like blocking half of me I moved my camera and then I didn't realize that my phone was recording in time-lapse and everything that I just said fast forward no sounds perfect lovely um so I'm gonna do it again because again we have nothing to do these days I'm gonna have the time to care enough fix something like this and edit it and post it I don't know what I was talking about I got into skincare somehow so yeah a lot has happened in those years I also mentioned in that video that I'm an aesthetician which is why I had gotten into the old skincare bed for a couple minutes that again nothing to do I've had the chance just thrive in my skin I feel like well especially now but just in general the past couple months I feel like makeup is more of a waste of time in the morning I still enjoy it I'm not gonna stop wearing and I I love it it's it's fun it's it's colorful but um I just feel like I want to just have bare skin more to see my skin just like naturally glowy and clearer than it used to be it's just like I I'm living I'm living for the low-maintenance the lighting is really good here but I might move to a different spot because people are little stuffs over here so yeah I've had the chance to grow up my hair I haven't worn extensions in months and months and months my curls have finally gotten to a length where I want to wear my hair curly this isn't even full curl this is like a couple months of keratin that's leaving my hair but I love this texture like my natural curls are just so annoying they're they're too springy to dry and this I always was like I wish I was born with wavy hair like I don't want straight hair but curly super curly hair is annoying you can grow it super long but you'll never be able to tell because it shrinks up and la la la whatever so this is like yes still super thin just because of bad ly layered haircuts that I was getting for years and years so it's gonna be thin for a while I was losing hair for a little bit so I'm okay with that so I don't anticipate it to be thick anytime soon but at least it's long and healthy and I don't have to wear extensions and and yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna move from this spot so just hold up quick sec alrighty so it's not the same lighting I like the other one better but this will do you can actually see more of the texture that I do have going on because it's that time of the month super irritating but my skin is way smoother way clearer than it used to be and it's like I used to feel bad for people that had acne all over their face in high school because I was like you know like that sucks and it looks painful and I don't know man I hit 20 and my skin was just like we're done cooperating it's just been a friggin journey with this skin man and this hair and I finally feel like the true struggle is over yeah I think I'm just gonna wrap it up here I just wanted to announce to my am I don't know like 40 subscribers the hood I'll probably be posting more videos no promises just probably and they're probably gonna be vlog style like this because the next video I probably will get into this youtuber I've been watching lately skincare by Hiram I want to get into more depth about that if anybody cares but I care and I want my opinions to be out there because feel like it's important he is a skincare channel he's not an aesthetician or a dermatologist he just from what I know he works for a skincare company where he is especially an ingredient specialist I believe he's super knowledgeable so I just kind of want to touch on that and maybe I'll do that while I like do my makeup or something no I'm just gonna go with the flow my birthday is in a week quarantine birthday don't know I mean I want to go hiking or something but there's really not much to do there's definitely no traditional celebration I'll tell you that everything's closed so there's that again thankful it's not like a big birthday I'm turning 24 but at least it's not 25 because I want to go big or go home for 25 2014 oh you can have a regular birthday you can have an at-home birthday for 24 so at least that and I'm just enjoying my time at home very thankful that I have a home like an actual house to enjoy it in and just think about work and just to school and and focus on myself and in my home in my family in my relationship and just all the the core important things in life besides work who knows maybe the next video will be in another three years oh yeah that's it one of the things that I've been doing - not pastime but just that I have more time for is reading so I'm gonna go do that and currently I'm reading its hold on - yourself it's by Gary John Bishop book it's like the pages are they're not super filled it's not a super heavy read and some of the pages aren't even like actual text so I feel like I'll finish this pretty quickly it really is just a book on changing your mentality and changing the way that you talk to yourself in your head which is something that I've been doing which is another video I want to do this whole I hate calling it a journey but that's what it is it's just like it's just a whole period of my life that I've been focusing on who I am and who I want to be and what I can do moving forward and just really focusing on myself and my mental health healthy relationships whether that's friendships spouse family whatever it is just healthy healthier relationships and really just doing it so pretty much this I mean I bought this book awhile ago and I just picked it back up now because like I said I do have more time now but I think I'll be finished with it fairly quickly but it just reinforces all of those things that I've been doing and just to keep me in a healthy mindset especially now it's so crazy now and I'm glad I took these steps to to try to do something before a quarantine because if I didn't check myself prior to quarantine I think I would have literally gone insane I would have had three mental breakdowns whole identity crisis and I don't even know what else just all in a months period like I'm just very glad that I started this a good amount of time ahead of time so that I could really solidify certain things within myself and in my brain so that quarantine didn't completely like throw me in the dumpster you know what I mean you know what I mean so yeah that's it that is it bye
