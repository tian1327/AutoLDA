   hi I am filming something I never thought I would be filming right now it's constantly over the news you've seen the title this is becoming so much more than I think anybody you thought it would be and I'm just trying to like figure out how to deal with it I mean I'm just trying to get what myself and my family need for all this this coronavirus is something that i i've thought is has been blown out of proportion a lot and now I don't know if I'm like under exaggerating about the whole thing so I've been hearing a lot of things and I am just trying to get myself and my family ready for whatever could happen as far as like lockdowns it's just not me go save our house goes I've already mentioned on this channel that I don't want to discuss what my job is but I am gonna be out of a job for a month now and I don't know how I'm gonna handle doing that I I don't know we have a meeting tomorrow to talk more specifically about what's gonna happen but right now I won't have a job until the end of April and that's really scary and hearing that stores are gonna close down and I don't I don't know like what's happening so this is my very broad real emotion about everything but considering that it's consuming so much of everybody's energy and it's so non-stop like it's hard to not talk about and acknowledge it so I'm trying to do that so right now I am trying to just get things I think we'll need that my dad sent me a small list and my first stop on my list of things I need to do is I need to get gas I mean that's something that I don't know you know if that'll be affected by it but I only have a half a tank right now so I normally wouldn't even fill up but I don't know what if all the gas stations dry up and I can't get gas and you know I mean like it's just you you just start thinking about all these little possibilities of things that could happen and what could go on so my first stop right now is to get gas I only need probably like 15 boxes to fill the rest of it up but I I don't even know if it's gonna be busy at the gas station or what's gonna happen but I just want to try to be prepared in that sense so I have a full tank of gas and then after that I think I'm going to go back to Walmart I've been at Walmart a lot the past couple of days and it's very if humbling is the correct word to use because I mean when they say like the shelves are empty like the shelves are empty so let's see there spot the responses that have a gas that I need I'm going to get here because now it's starting to get busy I'm gonna try to go to Walmart see if I can get what I need to last time I was at Walmart there was enough produce and that's part of what my dad wants me to get some produce so hopefully there's still the amount of produce there and this is just this is absolutely but in us absolutely bananas not something that I ever thought I have to be worried about not something that you ever think is really gonna happen it really just feels like a dream and like this isn't real but it's real it was happening so I don't know there's so many I mean I'm already starting this morning off strong I it was I woke up extremely distracted completely thinking about this coronavirus and I spilled an entire cup of coffee all over the floor and that is how I'm starting today and now today is because I like I mentioned earlier I've had the mentality that you know a lot of this is being blown out of proportion because it it's just the flu or like it's just pneumonia like it's not anything we haven't seen before it's the fact that we don't have any new vaccines like there's no vaccine for it so that's why I think there's been a big uproar about it but on top of it if you listen to the parts of the news where the truth I feel it comes out a little bit it's not even being heavily mentioned but the fact that people who do get this survive like for some people get this survive because they're healthy and they don't have any kind of underlying issues and that's the ones who are passed Blair the ones who have underlying issues and who are more elderly those the ones that are passing away which is under I mean I understand that but for someone like myself I feel like if I were to catch it and I think I already did have it honestly I was really really really sick in January I was sick for over three weeks I liked it was a housing the hard time getting better all the cold and flu symptoms I was knocking over it went to Urgent Care twice they told me it's just a cold it's just a cold it's just a cold well not all people are having the same exact thing and it's not just a cold now it has a name it's coronavirus I had like a really nasty sinus infection I had a bad cough I mean you have all the symptoms of a cold but it just lasts a lot longer instead of like getting over it in two or three days it was like two or three weeks of just being unwell and I think I had if I had two strains of something because I had I had it once at the end of the end of December into beginning of January and then I was good for out a week and then I got sick again with a lot of the same symptoms and I was sick for again I got two and a half weeks so I don't really know I think that's what this was I'm not trying to self diagnose but three they couldn't give me an answer back then and here what coronavirus symptoms are now that's what I think is going on with the reaction of everything I'm questioning myself now like am I in it because I'm not reacting the way everybody else is reacting like I don't know I don't know how to react I don't know how to feel like I just feel numb about the whole thing I'm gonna spill this blog into tomorrow because that's when I'll have my meeting for work and figure out if I'm getting paid for a month but like what I'm supposed to do do I have to go in sometimes do I have to not go in sometimes like I don't know but I don't know what's gonna happen so that's kind of where I am with stuff at the moment I feel like a lot of people feel that way and like shelves are on stores are completely empty and there's no toilet paper and there's so many things going on it's like is this actually happening like it's just a real thing that's going on right now because it doesn't feel like it's real how are you supposed to feel because I don't know how I'm supposed to feel I don't know I'm gonna take you guys with me hopefully you know there's a good amount of stuff I kind of do this the other day I did this on Friday when I got out of work and oh okay when I got how to work on Friday and I've gotten a lot of stuff like I got one of the last containers of coffee and I got the last box of pasta at Walmart and so well you will see what happens once I get inside plumber and I'll definitely film in there because this is something that is so beyond wild and I feel like people are gonna believe it when we talk about it later on in life it like this really happened unless there's evidence so that is the plan and I'll take you guys in and Walmart and we'll see what there is to see     hopefully I think I might have to go to Whiteman's - I really don't want to especially I really we get frozen pizza dough from   back seat full of jazz a place we can get and find pizza dough here we've been making a lot of stuff with that so I really don't want to go are falling for me today what's convenient about this is that everything is right in the same area so I have to do is really like just swing around I've heard how chaotic Wegmans is I don't want to go in there I was actually surprised I managed to find some paper towels and all these so I picked them up we don't need them but to have them and not need them than need them and not have them they want to go in all these but I want all these holy cannoli just went to Wegmans had no frozen pizza dough but I found his Betty Crocker stuffs I'm gonna try it this they're going to laugh I got two and I found a sack of flour I also sorry that that last clip didn't finish filming because I my friend called me and then I went right to the store but anyway flour the last yeah I actually got a pack for my friend when he called but they're only like this but now I'm gonna go home and he'll uh sanitized myself because this is bonkers so all in all I said way more money than I was planning on and I hope I had I just hope we have enough what it wasn't so much freaked me out that we have to like stay quarantined but if they tell us and the great day in New York that we cannot leave our homes and if stores shut down there are going to be some major issues major issues because if there isn't uh nothing we can't get more that's just not gonna happen so I'm sorry that video got caught up cut off because my dad was calling me back I'm just talking about a situation so I'm home now I got all of our groceries I need to unload  stupid hey guys good morning I just wanted to update really quickly I'm about to head to work right now for this meeting and they changed things a little bit so I did not know I'd have to prepare myself to be there all day long but now I need to prepare myself to be there all day long we also can't be in groups of more than 10 so what we're gonna have to split ourselves up in different rooms I just don't I don't know what's gonna happen and it's gonna be a while before I can even update you guys but there's my finger in the frame but yeah I got to head over there and okay you're on my dash again I know it's not the most ideal spot in the world that's where you are there's currently a for 11:00 p.m. and I'm just leaving work now that was one of the most chaotic days like ever that was absolutely insane I'm very flush because I was doing a lot of running around literally that was crazy it was actually crazy it was intense the entire time a lot of people are just a lot of people are seriously freaking out and that's obviously why they're closing all this stuff down I don't have to think at this point anymore I did find out however that I will continue to be paid which is a huge relief but I was still a bit nervous but that was like the first thing it was addressed today is that everybody will still be getting paid which is great by really good to hear because it's stressful I just don't even know how this is supposed to work for a month I don't know so I guess it's just the process of now seeing how it goes I guess I mean they told us we can come back in our building that I work in is open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. so if you need something or if you forgot something you can go back to the bility you get it but we tried to get everything that we could because we don't know what's gonna happen 24 hours from now and 24 hours from now we can all be quarantined in our homes so we don't wanna just like leave stuff just by the off chance that we might be able to go back and get it so it was just a lot of getting stuff together and running around I volunteered to go in tomorrow to get a couple more things done but they already had enough people for what they were trying to do so I don't have to go in tomorrow so I think I'm just gonna try to hunker down in my home I have a ton of work on my passenger-side seat I'm gonna try to keep myself busy with work for a while hopefully I don't have to go back in that's really the goal is to not go back in and that sounds kind of silly but at this point I really kind of wanted to stay in my house relax and do whatever work I can't come home so that is my spiel I don't think I'm going to add anything else in this video so if you stuck around this long thank you very much please give this video a big thumbs up and subscribe down below tell me how this is affecting you where you live because I know it's affecting people all over the globe and it's actually it's I keep saying okay I keep seeing this is insane and I keep saying that you know this is crazy but it really is if you have any comments please leave them down below for me and we could talk about this or whatever but I hope you guys enjoyed this vlog and I'll definitely keep updating with what keeps happening and I
