 thirty videos I put out 30 videos in 30 days I've learned a lot and I'd like to share some of that knowledge with you when I started making YouTube videos eleven years ago I didn't really have a specific goal of what to do I didn't really think about what I did I just acted upon it and it just so happened that the thing that I liked making back then were parodies of songs somewhere along that time I've kind of lost the identity of my channel and I've kind of lost what makes me happy because like most other youtubers I began chasing views I began looking at the numbers rather than the content itself that's around the time when I found the cosplay community where a lot of the people in that community enjoyed what I did I think that the hard thing is that I am a people pleaser and I do enjoy seeing other people happy I like being able to make content to know that it entertains other people but at the same time I feel like every artist needs some kind of validation that what they're doing matters I went into this vlog series knowing full well that my views would drop and that I would be starting over from the very beginning rather than keeping myself in a safe and secure place I could have basically pumped out like a cosplay montage with old footage like every week for like the past month or two but I didn't really feel like doing that I've always been very adamant about not selling out when it comes to your work my first cosplay related song conventions took me over a year to write because I didn't want to just pump out something from an outsider's perspective I wanted to actually live the experience and be able to reflect off of that and I think that that's kind of what I've done with this vlogging series I do admit that before this quarantine I was getting a little lazy at making stuff but I think that I do long for that challenge of being able to create something amazing a couple of nights ago I did finish my video early and I did want to refresh my mind with the old songs that I wrote in the past and so I picked up my guitar and I started playing I enjoyed running through my songs I enjoyed doing covers of songs that I haven't played in a while I enjoyed just being able to be free with my guitar I think that that's the last missing piece of this vlog you know like on my banner it says music comedy and cosplay I think that I got the comedy and cosplay part down but I've been lacking on the music I've been trying to think of a way to combine the music with this vlog because then that way once I combine those three things together I feel like I'll have harmony with everything I do on this channel this first month was basically experimentation to just see what it is that I like doing I think the best thing that I can do right now is to just constantly experiment the one thing that I do want to emphasize is again I'm grateful for the people who's been watching I really appreciate you guys if I know that you guys are enjoying it then I'm gonna do my best to keep making content with the next coming months I'm gonna try some new things I'm not too sure what I'm gonna do yet but I do feel like there is potential now that I have a structure and I have a format I think I'll be able to hone in a little bit more on what my real passions are what the driving focus of this channel will be I think that in this upcoming month you'll be quite excited to see what I have in store so with that said thank you guys so much for watching I'll see you tomorrow for another video and I hope you guys have a great week take care guys bye bye
