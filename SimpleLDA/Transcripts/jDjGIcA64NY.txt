 and dudette how's that burrito  good one of our residents got sick today we had to take him to the hospital I really don't feel good it's cured babe where are you I'm right here holding the camera this all seriousness Lulu that's it man you're in quarantine you are now on that side of the house and I am now on this side of the house for the next week for sure allergies John I'm not sure but the only way to be safe Lulu is if we take things to an extreme measure you're gonna stay on this side and I'm going to stay on this side everything down the middle all right you're already on my side you think the virus is laughing no boom just like the whole idea is that until we know for sure what you got if you want to cross to my side you got to put on some detox gear you got to scrub your body with sanitizer it's because I've been unclean my whole life that I've built a natural immunity to viruses cancers glaucoma cuts the patient so I think what I've heard is that dogs do get sick too like they can get infected no one you're gonna have to start wearing a mask all right you can yo she you're gonna have to wear this nest from now on you're gonna be able to cross from one side to the other you want to get Corona huh you want Corona I mean if we ever split up this is what life will be like for you anyway so you're gonna have to summon half the time with me and half the time with Lulu I'm just preparing you because we fight all the time one of us is cray-cray there may be two of us is cray-cray so oh man what does that mean where am I gonna sleep so I know I'm kind of joking here at the same time it's really not a joke until I am certain she doesn't have any Corona I will be sleeping here in my office and what I done it just made a makeshift bed here in the middle of my closet the messiest closet possible because that's where all the magic happens this is my life right now y'all this is where we're gonna sleep buddy for now I can't it's the end of the world thus we know it and we'll be fine all right so we've been in this quarantine now for over two weeks and the good news is that the patient that was taken to the hospital was negative that's right was not sick with the corona so we decided to mmm honestly you still keep our distance at this point yeah still keeping it you know I think the problem right now is I don't know if it should be a little bit or if it should be persistent that we should be strict about it because you are constantly creeping over to my side you're constantly breaking all sorts of the rules with social distancing and the problem here Lulu is that you are still going to work every day out there like like millions of people who work in the service industry you are still constantly exposed to a lot of people every single day so even if I'm not leaving the house even if I'm being vigilant about self-isolation the reality is you are going to cause problems that is so true because every day there's always someone's not coming to work why because they're having a fever and so they need to do the test and they need to wait till they get the test back before they come back to work so I have to agree it is definitely still an issue for both of us so we should continue social distancing and you know we try to joke about it because you know it's a pretty serious situation we're trying to make sure that people don't get overwhelmed too much by this whole thing but I think we still need to be actually extra cautious my cousin Patty and Steve right I mean Steve is a heart surgeon and works out of New York City basically the epicenter in the United States of where this whole outbreak is happening and he's recently moved out into the basement to live for the foreseeable future because he's volunteered to go work in the emergency room which is if you talk about an epicenter the epicenter of the epicenter is that emergency room and right now the percentage of doctors nurses and people who work in health it's really high who end up getting it anyone who works in the health industry anyone works with a lot of patients like you has a much higher chance of getting exposed so far no one in the places that you work I've got sick right yes okay so no one has got sick yet and Vegas so far I mean right now they actually did have a case of Corona that has already broken out in the Costco that's literally right across the street from where we live so that Costco at this point I don't know if it's actually open or not but you know once an employee gets it that's it it's like you know what do you do and it's that close so we are literally a hop skip away from people who are getting it I don't know how long we can continue to dodge this you know I think that's one of the most interesting questions of until there's a cure you can't dodge it forever it's highly viral and spread but the whole idea here right now is just try to prevent our health care system for being overwhelmed so that's why we're doing this whole social distancing thing maybe it's inevitable that everyone does get it at some point so that you could develop an immunity to it I'm careful when I get home I always you just told me that you don't shower every day you get home before you do anything the minute you get home is go to your room take off your clothes dance naked in front of the webcam make a couple of dollars and then after that wash the clothes take a shower and then the risks are mitigated right I want to say it's 100 percent but at least it's a lot safer one of the things we did during this quarantine here is make sure we scrub everything down so Lulu spent the whole day getting some of that period getting some of that sanitizer some bleach and just wiping everything down wiping everything down we had in our car as well because she drives the car and I also drive the car so these sort of transitions like every time I get in the car now I just John doesn't like using hand sanitizer by the way I don't it feels to be I was so emotional I'm telling you because I couldn't get hold of any disinfectant and I start you know I started crying for something like that I was amazed that I would get into that emotion because I was so scared I mean even right now I don't know how we're gonna be able to film this kind of vlog ongoing because well I mean we're definitely not 6 feet away I hope you all are taking care for those who are working with service and stre share stories with us let us know how you're dealing with something like this and if you have any tips in terms of how to be able to cope with something like this because it is pretty tough when you want to your boo-boo this is what we do elbow elbow elbow for those of you who are sleeping in the basement or or something like me who's actually sleeping the closet still hang in there there's a lot worse that could happen right so I'm not going to complain a floor is hard I thought you said you like that kind of I like the kind of foam but not every day of my life
