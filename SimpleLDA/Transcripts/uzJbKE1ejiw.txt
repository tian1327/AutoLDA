 man oh man I tell you it's been hot outside it's been hot outside and you know this morning we did this livestream talking about um you know how is the corona virus affecting the car business right and you know I didn't really get to dive into as much about it as I'd like to but kind of what we're dealing with right now what I'm dealing with on the parking lot out here with a customer right now it's kind of kind of a great subject to dive into talking about how the corona virus is affecting the car business now it may not be affecting you know this particular situation that I'm going to tell you here and when I get a moment to do it it may not be affecting you at your car dealership but but it the corona virus it's it is affecting things even if you're not sick or unhealthy there's more to this whole thing than you think so just stay was all right everybody so here is a 2008 GMC yukon denali pretty nice looking truck you know got a nice looking wheels michelin tires got tons of tread on them you know not a bad looking vehicle really pretty nice it's got the black leather interior in it navigation you know DVDs sunroof semi miles on the on the Yukon Denali we we can get quite a few of these in a dealership of work at and we get a lot we sell a lot of Tahoe's Yukons and Suburbans and escalates these seem to be are tough ticket items during tax season this one currently has let's see they're two hundred twenty eight thousand five to eight price on the yukon denali again a know eight with 228 k is eleven nine ninety and the down payment on it is thirty three fifty so remember that 3350 is the down payment all right so back to what we were talking about earlier now here's the thing okay I've had a young man he's been in here probably three or four times in the last month and a half looking at vehicles with me and he comes up here on Monday hold on a second comes up on Monday and says look man I'm pretty much at the point of going ahead and getting a vehicle he said I'll be back on Thursday and I said well how much money you're gonna have he said two thousand dollars and actually originally it was like 1,500 but he comes in today he says I got two and you know Tommy I'm a little bit more a little bit more and here's the thing we usually do these things called picked up payments on the down payment basically meaning if the car on here's got 35 cash down and you got $3,000 we'll go ahead and let you take the vehicle home with you put some certs on it it's your car and then you're gonna need to do a $500 pickup payment on the down payment within the next two weeks so that means in two weeks from now you're gonna need to come back in with 500 bucks pay the down payment off and then two weeks after that your regular car payment will start which is gonna be 400 a month 200 bi-weekly so every two weeks to come in and paying $200 for the next three years then they have the vehicle paid off well the owner came in yesterday and he said look guys with this virus going on we're seeing people closing their businesses closing restaurants malls stores I mean people are out of work right now until this coronavirus thing you know goes away and with that being said while we are still open here to our store we need the full down payment on the car so if the window sticker up there's got 3350 on the window we gotta have 3350 for it no more pickup payments at all so that's the situation we're in and that's part of it because during tax season over the last three weeks when this thing started with tax season and tax season is still technically here but people are really holding onto every bit they got right now and they're not really buying a whole lot of cars because people are concerned they don't know how long they're gonna be out of work they don't know if their job is gonna close or not going to close so why would you take your $3,000 or your two thousand or even a thousand and give it to a car lot unless you absolutely need a vehicle immediately okay and you're better interest probably to hold on to your money and if you can get by with with the car you have or whatever you know for the time being if you better to do that and then wait until there's you know all goes over and then come back and get a car and life's back to normal but with this going on it's screwing us up because we're not able to sell as many cars so right now it's not about the quantity of the vehicles that were selling it is the quality of the deal that we're selling meaning basically we don't care about having to sell five to ten cars today right now we need to get two to three deals a day but quality deals with all the down payment so you know the last few weeks here we've been doing tons of picked up payments with customers they get that tax check they come in they put the money down and you know 80 to 90 percent of the customers are coming back within two weeks doing a pickup payment that's off the board so anyways this customer here today that test drove this Yukon just now that really wants it he's only got 2,500 and we just got off the phone in there with the boss man he said look I need 33:52 day if they can't do it they need to pick a different car out so even though they don't really want to pick something else out the Yukon Denalis off the list right now so anyways looks like the customer just now I just had to cut the clip talk one of the guys looks like reality just kind of hit head home here and the guys having to pick out something a little bit different Alexis rx350 you know I never would have thought he'd be picking that particular type car out but um that's what he picks out so anyways it's two thousand dollars less than this and and it works with the down payment that he's got it so anyways but here's the funny thing you know I'm being told just now like the customers saying why is that guy showing us vehicles like Tahoe's and Yukons I mean that's because that's what in the world y'all were looking at earlier and that's what I was showing you and you know that's what you wanted so anyways I guarantee if they were doing the picked up thing they'd be buying this thing right now but anyways whatever get what you can get get what you can afford don't overextend yourself and get what you like okay I mean let's be serious here I mean drop something that you do like don't settle for something if you you know anyway see you I'm sure unless y'all understand what we're talking about but you know sometimes you just got it you gotta get what you gotta get right I guess that's the whole deal so that's the little Lexus right over there that that customer actually ended up deciding to get you know so I guess you know something I'm having to learn in the car business cuz I've always kind of worked at the franchise dealerships new car stores usually a new car dealership it seems sometimes like you're letting the customer decide kind of what they want because in most cases they're buying the vehicle that they want and you know and it's usually something that they can afford in most cases what I'm having to learn at the the used-car business like this about your pay here sometimes I guess you just got to take them to the vehicle that they have enough money to get or they can't afford you can't what I'm learning now is that you can't always you know let them decide what they want cuz they're gonna pick out the nicest the prettiest the best the champagne of whatever we got on a lot and you know before you know it the car isn't enough coming back to us sometime later so you know sell them what they actually can afford is what I'm learning and sometimes just got to take them to the right car and say hey this is what you can afford you know there's another customer I'm dealing with right now the vehicle that we're in right now is a is a 2005 GMC yukon XL denali with hood 206 thousand miles on it or 69 95 and you know we just had to tell her you know same kind of situation she only has two thousand dollars down this one's 1980 this is the only vehicle we have on the lot with a third row seat for her family that works I mean it's either this or nothing and so I guess she's decided that uh that this would be it so anyways
