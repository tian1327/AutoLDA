 hey there it's dr. Doug willin I just wanted to do one more video today is an update just starting to really see these numbers soar so I'm here in New York City if you saw my video this morning this is gonna be a short one I said earlier today that a New York state with six percent of the u.s. population is accounting for around half of all the cases a worldwide we're at three hundred and three thousand cases with 12,000 deaths good news ninety four thousand recover but you can see that number is means there's two hundred thousand people who that did not recover yet so they're still suffering this is kind of interesting to me so this was yesterday the stats yesterday I know this is covering my face but notice that in the total number of cases the US yesterday was the sixth I don't want to say six places it sounds like a competition but the sixth leading country with cases so it's China Italy Spain Germany Iran and then the United States and then France so now let's just go 24 hours later to today and now the u.s. no that's still yesterday let's go up one more there you go and now today the US is and fourth fourth position with most total cases as you can see I have like a little hand there new cases four thousand seven hundred and fifty four and what's interesting about this to me is that we are behind Italy like two weeks with their exact graph or very similar graph and we're not doing what China is doing where we don't have though we don't have that in place so we're really looking more of Italy's trajectory and the numbers are starting to move exponentially as some of the leading pandemic experts have predicted so that's what I wanted to point out I am alarmed I just went on a hour-and-a-half bicycle ride in Manhattan and I came back and looked since so those numbers jump please subscribe if you're interested hit the alerts and we'll talk to you soon
