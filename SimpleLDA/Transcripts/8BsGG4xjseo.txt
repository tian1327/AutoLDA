 gee Glaus transcription hey guys this is the end of the wick as you can see we all have to wear masks right now because the situation only gets worse America leads the race in number of cases a lot of lists they're trying to do something they now mandatorily tell people you need to wear something on your face if you have a mask you wear the mask if you don't have the mask you wear a blanket or in these sorts of drapery just to protect yourself from from physical contact with moisture with the virus so there's been a pretty slow week in general because businesses are preparing for the worst some of the businesses like zoom got a real boost this week because people started telecommuting they need the voice they need video conversation that is drunk to keep presentations to keep running the meetings so that startup really got got off the ground pretty well Harry that's four we work they can work in space that many of you probably dealt with they are experienced and a little bit of a turmoil because we work is mostly for small businesses and when the downturn happens like coronavirus the small businesses get hit the hardest they are the ones who are always struggling to keep the rent going and therefore and and if you know we work there are no cheap rents in the work if we work as a premium office co-working sharing space serving no snacks beer in heaven nice atmosphere they charge a premium for a space in Manhattan so they're not right now it's a very big problem trouble because they they they are business that largely depends on the tenants and if there's tenants all be allowed now if they're all currency in a stay at home we work will not be able to collect the rent so we'll see how this future news unfolds but for now I'm being cautiously optimistic so in general I'm seeing a slowdown in a company spent everybody is on the on hold lots of projects are being right now buried into the into the project management drawers nobody is pulling the trigger because if you can if you can understand where we could be falling into a global recession because America is the is the strong country but there are lots and lots of other countries in the world who might be affected even worse who who has dictatorship their presents are lined to their people they are denying all the cases of of the of the sicknesses which in turn will would make it even worse for in the end of a date will be even worse for them to deal with so we'll see how this unfolds how this unravels I'm thinking three to six month we might have a bit of a recession on an optimistic note that in three months we'll be out of this pandemic and in six months companies started to recover and bring their spending level to the same same level where they were before this virus has started so what to do in this next six month that's the big question all right are you going to lay people off are you going to shut down the office and become a purely virtual company I don't know it's your call you're the business owner when it comes to my tools what I'm offering is not reproduce I'm offering you more options since then my companies are built with the idea of globalization telecommuting like language translation for interpretation transcription of the audio files so you can run your YouTube channel create subtitles and foreign languages so I'm hoping my business will not be as affected as many of the regular businesses such as plumbers electricians construction workers restaurants hospitality industry where the global ban would be very painful for them so that's it that's it for now thank you guys for watching we'll be in touch bye bye stay well g-got transcription
