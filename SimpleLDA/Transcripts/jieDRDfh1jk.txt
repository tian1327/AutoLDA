 five days without social media in quarantine baby I've been thinking for the past bit about what thing I wanted to try next if you guys are new here I do these videos that are like trying something I've done five different morning routines of CEOs hang out at 6 a.m. 5 days a week and honestly thinking of something to try while you're stuck at home is very difficult but the one thing that I felt that I could do and I would actually be super useful was trying to go without social media when I was thinking about doing this video I actually really tried to research and find you know an article that supported the claim that social media can be really harmful when you're stuck in isolation or like maybe it's something that we're really addicted to in isolation I honestly couldn't find any articles that weren't super positive about social media during this time I only really found ones that said it's great for spreading information it's great because you can FaceTime people it's great because you can read the news and while those things are true I think the opposite of those things could also be true sometimes whenever I only feel like I can FaceTime people or I'm only looking at people's Instagram stories it almost makes me feel more isolated so much conflicting information that sometimes social media can not be the best place I've felt like I've been in a weird relationship with Instagram specifically over the past month just really scrolling aimlessly a lot really liking that I can interact with people and interact with comments and messages at the same time feeling like because Instagram tells someone when you read their message if you don't respond right away that it's gonna come off as mean you can feel like you have to share every single part of your life I'm cooking banana bread for the fifth time that week like no one really cares sometimes those things just aren't very good for you sometimes getting so many different opinions from different people a while ago I was really in denial and I actually turned off my screen time because I just didn't want to see it I don't want to interact with it I didn't want to feel confronted by it I'm going to check it today let you guys know what my screen time actually is 5 hours and 3 minutes which I honestly have it checked in a very long time and that is very bad and the largest category of it is Instagram my average time on Instagram alone is an hour and 38 minutes which is honestly just insane yes social media actually is you know technically my job and so it's with different doing a fast from it when I do technically still have them work for it so I decided to fast from LinkedIn Instagram and Facebook because I felt like those were the things that I really just mindlessly consumed without actually thinking about it YouTube is different I think that I watch a lot of educational content on YouTube rules for this the first one is I still have a few things I need to post on Instagram it so if I do have to post I have a podcast going up on Wednesday of this week with someone else for their podcast and I want to be able to promote it because I feel like that's kind and gracious instinct took the time to interview me everything is already drafted it's ready to go up I'm gonna report back to you guys when this is over and let you guys know how it went what my thoughts are let's get into the challenge and also let me know what else you'd like me to try next morning so it's day one of this fast it is 8 o'clock on Tuesday it's funny cuz usually when I wake up in the morning I spend like 20 minutes just scrolling on my phone looking at like what's going on what I miss I don't really have that so I guess we're just gonna get up I'm starting off by morning by just doing my morning devotions and reading Philippians in the Bible and the journaling I always do this no matter if I'm like not on social media or I am gonna go ahead and do this to-do list is done reading is done and now it is time to go work out good to go Roxy and I are currently on our little walk it's very nice going for a walk right now it kind of gets you out we're like starting work really really chilly and tucks us today's hence why my nose is like so red you see the bunny it's really nice actually not having social media cuz usually when I do this I play a podcast and do my walking in the morning but a lot of times I'll get distracted and like start throwing on Instagram as I'm walking and doing that it's nice just not having that distraction I feel like I'm actually taking in the podcasts I'm listening to the what I'm listening to right now is how I built this and they did an episode with the founders of sweet greens like one of my favorite podcast it's so interesting to hear how people built successful businesses I usually have an urge to like Instagram when I go for a walk if you follow me on Instagram you know I'm always doing a little walk story posts but it's honestly like who really cares if I'm going for a walk so it's kind of nice just not sharing it that's why outstate after I just got back from my walk I went ahead and did a little like Pilates leg workout I have one that it's from Fitness Blender that I do that I really like and I love combining this with a walk for like a very low impact workout because some days I just don't want to go for a run I don't want to do like a crazy intense hit workout and that was today so I feel really good and now it's about time to actually start working for the day so I'm gonna go ahead make myself at home at my desk and start working on your neck because I got really cold interrupting this work session to say I usually check my phone a lot while I'm working and I will get distracted and start looking at Instagram stories when I really shouldn't be funny thing is while I'm not getting distracted by in serum I'm finding new things to distract me I'm still watching YouTube and I'm watching my girl Janine right now because I love her videos I'm finding that I'm just watching a lot more YouTube right now and obviously this would probably be a lot more effective I did it go on YouTube but there's no escaping YouTube because it's literally what I do but the thing is I can still edit while I'm watching videos at the same time so it's kind of okay just goes to show that don't find things to distract you I'm about to get ready I have not gotten ready and over a week getting ready to film a couple of videos today but I like to film on my sister Jamie's room and she works from home so I have to wait till she's done working from home let's fix this no we are ready guys this is crazy because I don't think I've worn like actual jeans at all during this period so I feel like a new woman feels really good my brows are really crazy right now because I'm trying to grow them out since I can't get them waxed and so I think we're all kind of going through a weird time with like not being able to get our nails done get our eyebrows done get your hair down 6:15 I just finished filling I'm gonna go ahead and clean up all this mess I just made proxy hates when I record cuz I move around all this stuff and it scares her so this is her face right now  yeah I made some pizza to miss you  some days you just gotta shake it I to-do list is written and I am ready to work I just put on my blue light glasses these are from Felix gray I love these I just got these and I think that they're so cute my laptop right here today is an editing day I have lots of videos at it which are honestly my favorite days one thing that I wanted to say was last night I spent a lot of time with my family and I was reading a book while just like chatting and it was really nice not being distracted by social media actually like when I sit with my family at night I'll get distracted and just scroll through Instagram scroll through Facebook but it was really nice just reading and not having any distractions and I really liked it so I'm really grateful for that taking a little work break right now so I just got a couple of packages in the mail what I viewers reached out to me and she has her own clothing boutique and wanted to send me a couple of things and I got excited and I opened a couple of them I'll have it linked down below if you guys want to check it out and she actually gave me a coupon code to share if you want 20% off you can use a code Michell 20 but she's really cute pieces frilly top this is so cute this is adorable I cannot wait to wear this when I actually have somewhere cubed to go to this little t-shirt was just so applicable right now and literally says homebody I really want to take an Instagram photo in this for reference I packed for about two weeks worth of clothes and so I did not expect to be here for months on end I'm actually really in need of clothes because I'm wearing all my sister's stuff right now since I was so thankful when she reached out and she sent me so much stuff oh my gosh she is so sweet oh my goodness this is like so my style we got this little baby doll dress it's like a linen material I love orange color so cute this is such a cute little romper it has like a little Thai romper so my style to be so cute if I could have a bridal shower right now I would wear something like that and last thing here it's actually nice chilly in Texas right now this is a little color-block sweater and it's super soft this is so comfy I feel like Jamie or actually I like this too thank you so much I cannot wait to wear those pieces I was like way more and I thought she was gonna send another day another bedroom vlog clip I have just been working here for quite a bit of time I just posted a video on 30 money mistakes to avoid in new 20s if you guys want to check that out it's also Eden's birthday and I wanted to show you guys I put together this little video of like his friends and family saying happy birthday so used to being with him on his birthday so I'd like to been together since we were 18 and so it's just weird but he's 22 today which is exciting I think we're gonna FaceTime later he opened his gift tonight I showed in a video and he was super excited because he loves all the Texas stuff I also finally updated my channel alright Fran Emma actually made this for me she's a graphic designer and it looks so good I also went ahead and organized all my videos in a playlist something that I haven't done a long time because I never say that I have time but now that I do have time went ahead and did that  grocery store had slim pickings on rice so we're trying to use these bags I've never done this before but I just have a feeling this is not gonna work out these little bags of rice see fish was okay I would probably give it an 8 out of 10 I'll link it down below if you guys want to try the belt and I always take questions about how I sell tan and I use loving tan and dart it's about eight o'clock right now I'm probably going to watch something on my laptop and then I'm also gonna FaceTime ate it it's 8:30 joining a zoom cult with some of my freelance friends who I work with in the city and we're all just doing like video call where we all join and work together to keep ourselves productive put on some real clothes which I'm very proud of I'm wearing the homebody shirt that I got yesterday that I unboxed with jeans from made well it feels actually really good wearing jeans I noticed that a lot of times when I get bored while I'm working or I get kind of distracted I'm like losing motivation I will turn to Instagram and I'll just scroll and think that somehow I'm gonna find inspiration but one thing that I've noticed was that zoom call us my friends was super motivating kind of hearing what's on their plate getting some social interaction really helped we literally just kind of went on and acted like we were at like a co-working space kind of working together and it was really refreshing so just a tip if you feel like you're losing motivation something that I've learned I also found myself really wanting to like share it on Instagram like oh my gosh me and my friends working online I resisted that urge and it was kind of nice just doing something that I was just doing because I wanted to and not having to like post about it it is Saturday today I just got back from a run it's about 11 a.m. I slept in a bumper run now I must you do a little ab workouts from mad fit because I love her ab workouts any but they're really challenging just finished getting ready and this is a hairstyle that I've actually never really done before I'm trying not to use heat on my hair which is why you probably see my hair up a lot these little buns and I took my braids that I had and I rolled them pin them up and like pulled hair from the front and it's like these cute little buns I'm wearing this top that I showed earlier from Highland Avenue boutique I actually went ahead and laid outside which felt really good and I just showered and I put on a coconut oil like all over my body and it feels so good right now I'm actually about to do some work I typically don't do work stuff on the weekends but one tip that I have and something that I've learned is inspiration does not compass frequent when I'm just like in my house but anytime that I do get inspiration I just try to kind of ride the wave and work even if it's on a weekend typically with my podcast which just launched and it's called but what's next and it's all about like my mentors and people who've really given me wisdom across my life and it also highlights a lot of like advice for people in their 20s but not just career also on like personal life and family I have a lot of solo episodes that I wanted to do even though it is very interview heavy might do some podcast outreach I'm also just gonna play a playlist on Spotify and just have like a cozy little evening in my room just made a playlist on like really chill vibes I feel like I never talk about my music taste so if you guys want to check it out have it linked down below  and that is the end of my week I wanted to run through the pros and the cons of everything that I experienced over not having social media for five days pros I think the first one was I got so many things done so many things that I felt like I was putting off I had been putting off inputting a lot of my business expenses since I do my own bookkeeping getting a new channel art done organizing my videos into playlists so they perform better just random backend things that I felt like I just wasn't doing I did all those things I also didn't feel the need to share random moments I love Instagram but sometimes I just feel like any time I take a picture of something I have to share it on my story and it was kind of nice just taking photos of things and just having them for myself I was a much better communicator for me personally I felt that since I didn't have you know Instagram and LinkedIn and all these things that distract me I felt that I was more likely to talk to people people my family more likely to talk to Aiden and just really be invested in communication with people I also felt really inspired when I returned I felt ready to just create content and I had more ideas and I was really excited to get back on truthfully and excited to see what other people were doing again for cons I definitely miss communicating with my viewers for me personally I always say my videos hi friends at the beginning and that's genuinely because I feel that everyone who watches these videos especially on Instagram that people will message me we just have a little community going I also get a lot of my industry news from LinkedIn it's kind of hard to keep up with the trends and updates because I get a lot of my industry news from LinkedIn so I definitely missed being in the know I felt like I missed out on some things but all in all the pros really outweighed the cons so I would highly recommend anyone watching this to do a day 5 day a week a month social media detox and see what it does to you if you do decide to try it let me know down below and also let me know something else you'd like me to try but make sure it's something I can do at home hope you guys are staying safe I love you guys and I'll see you guys my next video my friend  you
