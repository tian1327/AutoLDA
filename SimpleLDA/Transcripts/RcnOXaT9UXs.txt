because we don't know what's on these rustic booze they look real nice and you know I'm clean but I don't know I'm gonna get some lip bag leather that's what I'm looking for right now I think they're over there so I'm gonna look over there and get some bag letters some bad tomatoes anything that's in the bag that people have not touched because people have been touching this stuff all freakin day and I'm not for it they have this is just as good right here they have the spinach in the bag they have the salads in the bag all the list right here 2 4 5 I'd rather deal with that it's been actually money think it's sick because we are animals ha our home set we're trying to live we're not trying to die before we get there so instead of getting open packages we're getting closed packages so we got some letters be getting some Tomatoes we're gonna see what else they have as close you know even though these still might not be safe but they might be safer than the other ones so I'm gonna try to go down to the bottom in the back of the line rose to get it you know there's all these foods that are covered up that are very Silva said they are more safer than these these are not safe because people have been touching them and doing all kinds of like all the stuff like this not safe the stuff that has the factory sills those are the good stuff look guys okay all it is this is very unclean because people been sneezing or I'm not not doing it today well that I wanted some bean sprouts but I wish they was still in the bag I think that's how they gonna start doing all the food now they won't start stealing all the vegetables and stuff in the back you need to do that but it looks real nice all the stuff look beautiful you know it's nice you know that our challenge take they went above yeah it looks crazy I think we felt that challenge but okay guys we all finished shopping and that is what we did we sell the $60 challenge it was a hundred and thirty four dollars I should have
