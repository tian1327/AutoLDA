 that's how they came up with the terminology the angry black man angry black man you're acting like an auntie back that is true an angry Asian man haha my but right now I'm the angry Asian man I'm angry the world is just idiotic I live in a dump  that's why squad we back-end II can't thank you guys for tuning in to another episode of we're gonna go ahead and just review some of these videos I've been seeing all over the media room media and social media it's crazy it's ridiculous okay  let's check out these videos and I will share my thoughts everything that's going on in the world right now from George Floyd murder african-americans protesting as a matter of fact they're not even protesters they're criminals there's a difference between protesting and committing crimes you can protest still be within the law right I mean hello why are they committing crimes for well because I'm black no that's not the reason why let's check out the video shall we yes folks is happening in Los Angeles thousands of miles away from what it originally occurred that's crazy  I know Minneapolis folks these are Angelenos that's me really here though I just feel like this whole case that's going on George Lloyd and the police officer case the police obviously made a mistake okay he made a mistake people make mistakes nobody's perfect whether it was intentional it was an accident he made a mistake officer Dirk shavon had his and yes I completely agree he should be charged for murder by statute and by logic and my common sense yes this police officer murdered the poor man so yes he should be charged for that no  but does this give a reason to cause havoc folks this is happening in Los Angeles in my hometown this whole George Point case happened thousands of miles away it didn't even happen here the Rodney King beating all over again y'all remember the LA riots back in the early 90s I was like 9 10 years old when this happened a black man in Los Angeles some cops beat him the Rodney King beating and it just caused havoc it caused riots they everybody was looting vandalizing arson it was crazy the last time we had like an le riot causing mayhem the Le Rights that's the last thing I could remember I was still a kid when that happened now here we are happening again all because a white officer killed a black man no what do you guys speak let's say it happens to be a black officer killing the black man or a black officer killing a white man I mean we're just not wired to be able to say oh yeah that's a good point I get it I see what you're saying and I'm sorry this police shooting whether you know a white officer kills an unarmed white man this happens a lot too nobody talks about it there's no rights that went on after that people aren't protesting white lives matter Brailsford was charged with second degree murder over this January 2016 shooting it just happens to be a white officer killing a black man so of course that's where the term the angry black man you know how they came up with the term bit angry black man all my african-american people out there I completely understand we couldn't pump I myself am a minority I completely understand I can understand the pain and feeling of being looked down upon by society and I can understand where you coming from a fellow black man just killed by a white officer yes I can totally see how you guys see me angry but in general I'm not being specific but anybody in general african-americans here in this states does just give you guys the right to commit crimes yourself look at the news it's going on everywhere it's burning up buildings bring on cars causing mayhem they're blowing stuff up they're looting they're making into buildings breaking into businesses and stealing stuff there's a difference between protesting and being criminals y'all are committing crimes y'all are not protest I understand we have the right you know speech freedom of press but all this violence you guys are Kazi you're not doing anything at all what's the point what really gets to me pop up my people my Asian Americans okay good the past couple of months ever since the corona virus has started spreading like wildfire who's been attacked Asian Americans not even his Asian Americans without my agents all over the world check out these videos I'll think about it my Asian people are getting attacked bullied by all races on what I notice it's mostly African Americans but hey I'm not gonna bring color into this I'm just saying that my people are also being attacked bullied three-year-old and a sixth row getting stabbed by a Hispanic dude because they were Asian first of all they were mom it was a month I was a father and to his kids they went shopping at Walmart and this guy stabbed the two kids they're not even Chinese they're Hmong ignorant people do you know what mom is hmm OMG Hmong and Chinese are two completely different cultures get it right the people that are causing all this habit in the world are ignorant people I'm not implying any races at all just ignorant people in general there are ignorant whites there are ignorant blacks there are dis values or ignorant agents I'm not talking anyways at all I'm just saying ignorance it's what's causing everything going on the world not only with the protesters I'll talk about the qualifiers in a minute right now I'm just referring to these protesters 2020 has been a crazy year folks like I had an awesome 2019 2019 was amazing I love 2019 check out my video I did a rewind the Vijay TV rewind the 2019 and is it highlights of my year it was amazing it was a fun year I thought 2020 was gonna be better oh man 2020 has been the worst year so far in my life which is ridiculous you see all these african-americans protests black lives matter black lives matter why do you have to bring race for when my Asian people were getting attacked bullies Asian lights didn't matter then like come on think about it Oh God do you see my people going around saying Asian lives matter blowing things up robbing people burning buildings looting and stealing vandalizing do you see the Asian community doing that no okay we get the point we're getting talking to duplicating poet ever since the whole corner virus pandemic has been going on my Asian people have been suffering not just in America but all over the world in Australia Australia has a predominant large Asian population something about Asian Australians are suffering from it the words Asian Australian British Asians Asian American agents all over the world are being targeted for hate crime here's a video of this doctor I truly believe it check it out there's a patent on Commerce  it's not crazy his theory I believe him to lean on Siri I totally believe this theory I can totally see that Koba 19 was man-made it was manufactured in a laboratory by Americans and Brits think about that they created it in a laboratory in Wuhan but the culminating patent it was a US patent and the United Kingdom patent so a scientist in America and a scientist in the UK collaborated to simply a biochemical attack who knows for a reason it could be population control terrorism many reasons but the point is it exists it's affecting our people and it's spreading like wildfire we don't know the reason we may never know the reason but the reason is the last of our worries all we need to do is stop it honestly it's ignorance that's spreading it I have this app it's a news app that I've been looking at every single day and I'm looking at the numbers the numbers are just getting higher and higher every single day it's not getting lower it's getting higher and higher it's ridiculous in the beginning Italy and Spain had the highest number of cases even more than China where it was supposedly originated right yes we surpassed the entire European nation Americans USA think about that it doesn't that make me see you imagine how the world is looking at us right now the entire world is looking at us like think about it and I'm speaking on behalf of all my fellow Americans a lot of these guys are just not taking this very seriously and that's what's spreading it do you guys not understand what I'm pointing my social media feeds going through my facebook no it's not it's protecting us what it's doing all the stay at home orders is lockdown it's protecting us we have the right to live well that's what they're doing our right to live as a matter of fact lithic is not even a right living is a privilege and all these doctors are just not taking it seriously it's simple general biology this virus it's not slowing down I'm looking at the numbers every day the numbers are just getting higher and higher just a couple of months ago the entire USA was under a million cases we just surpassed 1.8 million we're about to hit two million cases Spain Italy Norway in the two hundred thousand range new 2000 there was a time when Italy had the highest are smart it isn't locked down this is the quarantine curfew nobody go out everybody stay home look at the numbers it slow down friends decreasing tryla decreasing and all the Asian countries decreasing Taiwan they're the smartest country check out this video right here the type of these governments are geniuses right away as soon as they heard about this and then they go a lot they took action very early January yet they were already taking action sanitizing the cities they had sanitation trucks cleaning the streets testing everybody they were on top of it were able to eradicate the virus a lot of Asian countries were able to eradicate the virus so early on before they even spread they were smart they took action right away they know what they're doing and so I'm looking at numbers European countries North America Australia all the Asian countries are there numbers are low the u.s. numbers so on Paris CEO the entire world are looking at us it's not me excuse my language this irritates me it's simple if everyone just follows directions the numbers can start going down as soon as I wake up in the morning I do I look at the numbers and it gets higher and higher and every time I see the numbers go up I'm nervous like do it this can get to me or my family how do you think the dinosaurs got extinct some believe it was asteroid some believe it was some kind of a biological warfare something of nature wiped out all the dinosaurs and they were extinct don't you think it could be a possibility even beans can be extinct as well with the rate that this virus is spreading eventually if we don't medicate it it can get to that point if everyone in the USA makes this virus seriously and we do tours stay home stay the home it's as simple as that under select open up be at that social / love it as a matter of fact take this time to focus on you do what you need to do you wanted to launch that business that you've always wanted to certain things that you've always wanted to do but never caught the chance to do it well this is your time do what you want to do nobody practicing social distancing no meticulous fired seriously it's just gonna get worse my mom is an operating room nurse my mom's an arm head we have a family group text and she's always texting me and my sniffling she's so paranoid I haven't seen any of my friends in person in the past two months some tenants that are staying here to pad and that's it those are my people I'm gonna hang out with staying in just working on my craft making videos making music being productive I understand a lot of people they're not really about that being an entrepreneur thinking outside the box running your own business you would rather to go out at work make their money you know straight time for money which is what they're used to okay I can understand that but what's more important money or your life your health that money that you're making is it really worth getting sick is it really worth dying are you gonna enjoy your money if you're dead like come on I have family in the medical industry they see people dying firsthand my sister is a surgical tech at cedars-sinai even with cords pages all the time I get nervous for her she got the n95 mask and she was another mask over it she wears a face shield every time she comes home takes off her shoes leaves a shoes outside that he goes straight to the shower and she watches her clothes right away after every shift I know people who are witnessing this virus affecting people firsthand even on my Facebook friends they have family and friends who have died who have been sick who have been affected by it so I'm taking this very seriously no joke but there's a lot of ignorant people out there who don't have any family or friends that have been affected they have an experience in or witness it affecting anybody so they just don't believe in what you want to think the numbers don't lie people are dying people are getting sick from this virus and it's not decreasing if the numbers for going lower loyola every time I look at the app and I see the numbers going down okay good you're doing a good job that's not what I see the numbers are getting higher and higher that's all it is every single day a couple weeks ago we were six Jewish New York New Jersey Illinois Massachusetts Pennsylvania in California then a week later we were number five now just a few days ago we're now about Massachusetts we're number four now in the number of cases New York New Jersey Illinois and in California crazy folks like the numbers are gonna getting higher and higher other people are not taking this very seriously it's the ignorant people that's going to be causing the world to end ultimately so just Los Angeles County alone we have fifty three thousand seven the point of these cases a couple of weeks ago we're only a thirty thousand range number of deaths 2339 the numbers are just increasing with the rate that is one what's gonna happen eventually it's simple math if you just see numbers going up and up and it's not going down other things eventually the world is going to be all dead people not think about that stay home be safe protect everybody if you all can just work on this together look as a team we can romantic ate this virus we can I was thinking summertime with children based on research the virus cannot survive in temperatures hotter than easy freeze summertime in California because we go hundred ten hundred five degrees out here just in the past couple of days it wasn't in the high 90s so I'm like dude that's dope that should be able to kill the virus but I was wrong the numbers are still going up on surfaces on public services yeah the heat would kill it there's a virus inside a host then the heat is not gonna do anything I just wish these people can just not take this virus light in understanding how serious this is everything that's going on this Brookes crazy Oh what's gonna listen to me though you know I wish like the bigger influencers would talk about this like PewDiePie he's nice that david dobrik influence people and get people to follow these orders stay at home and be safe and where mass it would be the influencers that can influence the world to wake up you know like don't take this virus lightly if we've got to do something about this the numbers are only getting higher and higher it's not dropping eventually it's given it to somebody you know we know somebody who knows somebody at this rate that is spreading it's like what got my channel go by make the weight coronaviruses that'll be awesome you know if you guys can subscribe if you can get this channel to go viral and the rate that coronavirus is going viral man I would have millions of subscribers but now just saying but for a back to the protesters I'm not bashing on the African American community you guys have your feelings I understand at the same time I have my feelings to Asians in general in the world are getting bashed attacked bullied for hate crimes do you see by Asian people going around blowing things up looting stealing burning buildings causing mayhem being violent you don't see that in history it's always been always the african-american cute whenever something happens probably over usually to be better no no screams increase they take every opportunity can when I say they'll talk about in general having an Americans in general in society is been on that throughout history there's always looking for something so they have a reason now reason oh but that's just this crazy this doopy you haven't noticed the age of the getting attacked majority of them were being attacked by African Americans I mean what's going on in this world they're all protesting black lives matter black lives matter do you see agents going agent lives matter agent lives matter all lives matter it don't matter what color you are all lives matter every time people bring up race it's so ignorant with Asian Americans when they were getting attack just let it slide we just stayed strong hurrah be the better person just standing around Mirai key move on with your life you know that the Cosme am conceding easy that's how they came up with the terminology the angry black man you're acting like an angry black man is through an angry Asian man haha smack back right now I'm the angry Asian man I'm angry the world is just idiotic I live in a duck's world I just feel like everyone in this world is stupid sad in America at least in terms of everything yo riots protesters for just making things worse plus whatever have practicing social business if you've seen the video all the protesters everybody was all congested yeah they're wearing masks but still everyone is all congested how much you want to bet the numbers you get a skyrocket just from everybody protesting and being next to each other everyone all congested into a confined space to protest so much for social distancing the numbers are just gonna skyrocket I bet you all those protesters everyone just spended it off to each other what are you realizing it trying to prove a point you know just making things worse ignorance is bliss that's what I feel that's a pandemic stupidity stupidity is a pandemic everywhere the world is just being a bunch of duck this stupidity is spreading I find it sad the longevity of humanity existence of humankind is going to end because of stupid is that what ever thought about that okay we get the point stay home yo I'm stopped loudly now is a long slog stay home be safe wear gloves wear masks when you go out it's not to protect you but to protect others because you could be asymptomatic you don't know if you have symptoms and you could be a carrier so protect others be courteous spread love spread positivity folks we can all do this together y'all for real if everyone just has my mindset forget the violence the world would be a better place if everyone just loves each other can we all just love each other yo it almost seems like it's easier to hate than to love we can stop the violence we can stop the hatred we can stop this virus if
