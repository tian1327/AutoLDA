 today is March 3rd and I've had the stomach flu really bad these last couple of days it's just been a really rough time I had to leave work early on Sunday because I just was like not feeling good and I felt very like feverish and yeah ever since it's just been not a very fun time for me so that's why I haven't vlogged in a couple days because I've been like what really dead laying in bed sick today's the first day that I'm starting to feel a little bit better like my fevers just just been on and off still today but I feel like it's finally starting to like settle down which is good he's like oh my god I haven't gotten sick like this in a really long time so like my body just doesn't even know how to deal with this like oh I hate being sick more than like anything in the world especially like when it's my stomach and like I hate puking more than anything in the world so these the last couple of days have just been very rough on my body and on my throat and uh but the only thing that's been like the shining light at the end of the tunnel for me is that I've been able to read quite a bit I've been like holed up in bed all day these last few days I have gotten about halfway through the book never have I ever I'm reading this one for the video that I'm doing for reading Jacqueline's favorites right now and then today I actually finished reading he started it I actually started this one last night I read the first hundred pages last night and then I just flew through this all day today and I've been laying in bed all day it's like 4 o'clock right now so I just finished it and like holy I'm so glad I just decided to bend you read this whole book today because it was so good and I think I don't know if it's like for 4.5 5 stars I don't know I need some more time to think about it but like this book was so freakin good it's like one of those thrillers where you would really can't trust any character that you're reading about and and it has one of those endings that is like the most shocking like I felt like I needed to reread those a lot couple of pages a few times just to make sure I didn't anything because it was just so crazy and I just I loved it so much like definitely gonna be one of my favorites it's just it was great I highly recommend it so yeah it's been a pretty nice afternoon despite not feeling very well but I'm hoping to finish never have I ever before at the end of the day just because I don't really have a whole lot going on and I'm just kind of like nervous waiting to see if my fever is gonna come back tonight I have survived the stomach flu I'm feeling much much better now huh it was a it was a brutal couple of days not gonna lie between Sunday and Tuesday I really thought I was gonna die there I just haven't been sick like that in years so it was just a really rough time for my body to handle and now I'm doing much better and I'm feeling great and the backless wreath on starts in a couple days which I'm excited about and I finally finished last night I finished reading all the books for the reading Jacqueline's favorites video that I'm doing so I rendered it late last night and so it's done rendering now but I really want to like watch through the video one more time to make sure everything's all good before I upload because it is quite a bit longer of a video I am bringing with me today what I hope will be my next read the good daughter I'm bringing it with me to work even though I haven't actually started it yet because if I do eat a break today that I would like to start reading it because I do want to read that one for the back Coast read-a-thon but because it's like 500 pages long I don't want to be reading it for like the entire read-a-thon so I think I'm gonna start it now with the hopes that I can finish it during the read-a-thon maybe like Monday or Tuesday I am bringing Lucky Charms and milk with me to work because that's just what you do apparently when you're an adult it is still Friday night and I got off of work a little bit early tonight which was great and so I went over to my parents house after work and just like hung out with them and ate some dinner and I haven't seen them in like so long so it was really nice to like see my parents again because I haven't seen them since like before I got sick and that was like over a week ago I haven't seen them in about a week so it's been a while it was really nice to catch up with them and mom gave me Girl Scout cookies like Samoas aren't the best thing in the world oh my god were so happy about this and also I did get a chance to start the good daughter I've actually been like I read a little bit in the office today while I was on break and then I also have been listening to the audiobook going to work and coming back home tonight and now that has put me on page 56 so I'm on chapter 2 now and it's like holy this book is really dark really graphic already it's like the way that she describes these like violent things is just it's a lot it's kind of like hard to take sometimes honestly like listening to this book and reading this book like it's hard to digest some of it kind of makes me nauseous a little bit so I don't know how much of this I'm actually gonna read like now and tonight and before the read-a-thon because Karen slaughters writing is just a lot so but I am really intrigued by this story so far so that's like the main reason why I definitely still want to continue reading it so I thought it might be fun to try and do a guitar cover of one of my old favorite songs from when I was like a little kid back when I listened to country a lot and I've just been like having this song stuck in my head a lot lately so I thought I would do a cover of it because I just love it so much don't you fool   if I can  No  and your fantasy  don't you       match   get you good I am feeling so productive today and it feels so good to finally be like back to normal after being sick you know because for a couple days there I've really still didn't have an appetite and I just like didn't even want to look at food for a while but yesterday I was like the first day I started feeling like a hundred percent normal again and then today just like getting so much done like I filmed two videos this morning I got a bunch of stuff ready for Instagram that I was needing to take pictures for and then I've edited one of the videos and it's rendering now and I started laundry and clean some of the dishes and just did so many things that I'm like happy to get done and then I do go into work in about an hour at 4:00 and then tomorrow I have the day off which I'm really excited about because I'm gonna be going over to my family's house to have dinner tomorrow night and I'm gonna be making dinner and I'm really looking forward to that because it's been a while since I've had that chicken dinner that I really like to make so I'm gonna get ready for work and it's gonna be a great day and also I forgot that tonight we actually lose an hour like it's spring forward or spring ahead or whatever it is already tonight and I didn't even realize that so that kind of sucks but besides that it's gonna be great day good morning it is the morning of Sunday March 8th and I have the day off from work today which is miraculous because it's Sunday and I just did something a little crazy I went in like splurged on myself which is something that I rarely ever do but I was really wanting some air pods so I just went and got them because I had like over $300 in tips saved it from the month of February because it was so busy in the month of February and just since I've had like a really stressful work month in February and then getting sick first second March like I've just been having a kind of rough time so I just wanted to like reward myself for getting through it you know and I've just been wanting air pods for like a little while because I've just seen a lot of people online talking about how when they go grocery shopping they like listen to audiobooks or they listen to music and that sounds freaking amazing because I hate grocery shopping so much like it's like one of my least favorite things to do and so if I can make it nicer for myself by listening to audio like that would make my experience so much better when I grocery shop I also really like how simplistic they are and my sister's boyfriend has a pair of them and so he was like letting me like use them and like figure out if it was something that I would like so yeah it's been a it's been a pretty great morning so far and then tonight I'm going over to my parents house to make some dinner so it just started hailing for some reason it looks so cool I don't know why it's hailing it's like psyche oh yes dinner is made chicken Locksley asparagus looks lit and there's Brad in here with water er I know right water and then you put like cinnamon in it and then it likes its earnest rain it look at me reading as a kid proof during a Bratz doll boy oh my god these old pictures that was the look no this one's actually cute though look at me my little sippy cup look at my sister dude she looks like such a mimin :  this one's a new dude man that one's super cute I don't know what you're doing but these are good what the heck oh I just don't want to be  that is a look this one's super cute I really like that one prettiest right in our little jeep buggy snickerdoodles which is the best cookie of all we all know yeah we all been new beanie thank you these are two hot Zealanders my girl said give me some order  me          whoa today is March 16th and it's been a while since I've seen you in this vlog but that is because the back Lestrade is on just happened between March 9th and the 15th and this morning is Monday morning it's the day after to update you on the state of the world it is the frickin apocalypse now no but seriously like rotavirus has like taken over the United States and it's just a crazy time to be alive and there is currently three cases in my County where I live right now and in the state of Washington there's like the most cases in the entire country and the most deaths in the entire country so the governor put a ban on dining in restaurants and he closed bars and clubs so now my restaurant at the moment is take out and drive-through only which is definitely an improvement but oh my gosh I'm just like like whoo no it's like every day something is changing and it's just like a really scary time and so I've been trying to stay home as much as I can lately and self isolate myself in social distance as they call it I feel like my anxiety has been really bad these last couple of days because of this just because it's just so crazy and it's kind of like a waiting game you know because with this coronavirus it's like you might have it and you don't show symptoms for up to five days so I feel like any time I'm going to work or like exposing myself to the public and not other people it's like from that day I'm just waiting five days to see if I start to show symptoms you know it's just like really scary again I'm not really like scared for myself because I know that I'll probably be okay if I get it but it's like I'm just really scared for like my parents and for other loved ones in my life like I just don't want to deal with the stress of knowing somebody that I love has it you know like it's just really scary luckily today I have the day off of work but I do work all day tomorrow and then I have off Wednesday and Thursday like we're really cutting down hours because of this because it's gotten a lot slower obviously people don't want to go out as much thankfully with this yeah I mean I don't know as I said it's just like really scary times right now but luckily I did stock up on books for my self-isolation gonna be happening this week and I have all of these books that I would like to get through very soon the ones that I just got in the mail yesterday that I'm most excited about is eight perfect murders undercover bromance and anyone by Charles Soule and so these three are probably definitely confirmed gonna be happening this week and then I'm also planning on finishing you we're not alone soon because I'm buddy reading this one with my sister right now I think that's like the one nice thing about like social distancing and self isolation is being able to read more like that is freaking great and honestly look I don't mind it I'm such an introverted person and like I kind of love the idea of being able to stay home for some time and just get to do all the things that you never had time for Rosie honestly what better to do during an actual vlog like it's Tuesday now it is March 17th look at what just came in the mail oh my gosh dude I'm really excited about real bed knit like this one oh my gosh I love the cover and I think it's so cute and I think it's gonna be really cute but holy Beach read by Emily Henry like this is one of my most anticipated reads of this year like I can't even believe that they sent me this I'm just so excited because I really love books that follow writers and this one is I'm gonna cute romance that follows two writers and she writes romance and he writes literary fiction and then they like change genres I'm really really excited about these and I think tonight I'm actually gonna try to jump into eight perfect murders also it's Tuesday and I got home tonight from working a double shift today and today was my first day working back in the restaurants since we got news that all the dining rooms have to close and things like that oh it was very strange to be working in a restaurant where we could only do takeout and drive their pickup orders there's just a very strange times like things feel very tense right now and I guess we're all just kind of like waiting to see what's gonna happen I'm just crossing my fingers that I don't get sick and that nobody that I love get sick it's pretty much what I can do even though I'm still stressed out about it like really high anxiety everyday about it but it is March 18th and it is a Wednesday and I don't go into work today thankfully I am chilling here in bed last night I did read the first 50 pages of 8 perfect murders and so far I'm really intrigued by it and I feel like this book so far has like a really different vibe then all of Peter Swanson's other books but I'm into it so far and so I'm kind of just planning on trying to finish this book today because it's only 200 like 50 pages long so I only have 200 pages left so it's only about like 12:30 right now in the morning we'll talk 30 in the afternoon I guess and so I'm just gonna like lay here in bed and read this book and not think about the coronavirus and not think about everything that's going on in the world and I feel like this book is a good distraction for me right now cuz I was actually able to get fifty pages into it last night which is more than I've been able to do for like anything else I've been trying to read lately so it is a little later in the night and I got really far into eight perfect murders I'm on page 218 so I only have about 50 pages left of this I don't know I don't really know how I feel about this yet but I will say that it has distracted me from everything that's going on in the world which is exactly what I needed right now and I've kind of been just like hooked on to this all day and like I was able to fly through it without checking my phone so that's saying something at least right so I'm planning on finishing this now but I also wanted to let you know that I watched the first three episodes of little fires everywhere tonight and I'm not gonna lie I like going into it I was kind of nervous because the trailers for the show was kind of making it look like it was gonna be like a thriller or like they were gonna try to go for that volume the book is one of my absolute all-time favorite books I'm really happy with the first three episodes like I think it's really good and I already have cried once it's just really hitting the nail on the head with the like motherhood story and I just really like what I'm seeing like I think it's doing a really great job of representing the storylines happen the book and the story is just as interesting in the TV show as it was in the book I'd love to see Reese Witherspoon playing Elena because she just reminds me so much of her character big little lies like I mean I know Reese is basically playing the same character from big little lies but I love seeing her in that type of role anyway so it doesn't even bother me and I love Kerry Washington as Mia Warren she is great she's like the definition of like a complex fascinating character to watch and to read about and I just really really love it it's just it's doing a great job at being true to the book which I really like and I'm just really curious to see where it goes and I'm sad that they only uploaded the first three episodes like now I have to wait a week for the new episodes like this sucks hello hello it is March 19th it is Thursday I did go to Target this morning because I had to go to the pharmacy to pick up some stuff for my mom and luckily I think it went okay it was actually really dead there so I think everything's fine I did end up finishing eight perfect murders last night my Peter Swanson and hmm I don't know I was kind of underwhelmed by the ending not gonna lie I don't know I'm feeling like it's probably gonna be a three star read for me when will Washington though and title are you today is March 21st not much has really changed lately for us and the state of Washington as far as like coronavirus goes the governor had like a little speech that he gave yesterday and he just said he's begging the people of Washington to stay home he doesn't want to have to put a shelter in place in order because he believes in the people of this state to like do the right thing and stay home and it's just like really frustrating because he's being such a little and not doing anything we're just kind of waiting for a shelter-in-place order to happen so that we don't have to be going to work every day and like exposing ourselves to hundreds of people you are kind of expecting a shelter-in-place to happen like in this next week like within the next week like I'm kind of hoping it happens by like Monday Tuesday or Wednesday but it might not happen until like next weekend like we're just waiting around to like see what's gonna happen yeah that's always fun it's honestly just so frustrating because like New York California and Illinois all have shelter-in-place already happening and Illinois and California don't even have as many cases as Washington does it's like I don't know what the hell he's waiting for like he's just waiting for more people to die like I don't know yeah so that's what's new with that I go into work tonight at 5:00 and then I work all day tomorrow so yay I'm just kind of like I'm so ready to just go into like full-blown lockdown quarantine like I don't want to leave my apartment feel like I was born to social distance like I'm a hundred percent okay with this I'm like more than ready to do that and I'm tired of going to work every day and feeling scared and terrified but uh yeah that's update and the other night we did watch that movie ready or not and like wow I liked the movie I liked the concept of but it was a little bit too gory and graphic for me I felt a little bit queasy watching it to be honest it was a lot but anyways I'm just gonna try to lay in bed this morning cuz it's only about like 12:30 right now and the afternoon and I don't go into work til 5:00 so I have a couple of hours to kill so I think I'm gonna jump into Undercover bromance and just try to get lost in something that's like really light and funny and fluffy hopefully and just try not to think about all the chaos going on in the world right now not much has changed today besides the fact that our governor in Washington has tweeted that I heard a few people gathered in large groups this weekend a reminder you are endangering yourself here loved ones and the vast majority of Washingtonians who are responding responsibly it is reckless and must stop he's the one who has the authority by issuing a shelter-in-place order but is he doing that no it's just it's getting so ridiculous like oh my god it's just crazy to me that Washington has some of the most cases in the US and we're still not in a lockdown I'm just like getting more and more nervous going to work every single day it's getting more and more serious and I just know it's gonna happen in these next couple of days like it has to happen anyways I did want to update that earlier today I did get a hundred and fifty pages into Undercover bromance which I'm excited about I originally was buddy reading the return with Jacqueline but then we both hated it in dnf2 ID enough tit at about 70 pages in I just oh my god I could not get into it so instead we're buddy reading undercover bromance together I don't know if she started it yet but um I read 150 pages before I went into work and now I'm gonna just lay in bed and read a little bit before I go to bed because because I'm trying to go to bed early tonight because I do work all day tomorrow and I kind of have an early morning because we have another meeting on the phone at 9:00 I'm trying to do this thing know where I've put my phone away like an hour before bed and don't look at any more news like an hour before I go to bed because I just find that if I'm on my phone right before I go to bed looking at the news like I feel like it's so bad for my mental health and I feel like the other night I literally had a straight-up like panic attack thinking about everything that was going on and I couldn't even breathe and it was like it was just really scary and like thinking about everything going on like in my state and in the world and everywhere it's just it's a little too much for me right before bed you know so like I'm trying to do this thing where I just put my phone away at least an hour before I go to bed and just try to like read my book listen to some ASMR and just like calm myself down so Rachel just made this dope-ass dinner that is this with cider there is this is like alfredo yes and then we got chicken we got some bacon in there yeah and then we have a nice binge oh yeah we got some of this bread aren't on it is yeah this is the Cheesecake Factory but hey I save weight so yeah super-good dark and nutrition amazing yeah they also got asparagus on cheese oil and garlic salt and pepper yeah oh so friggin good cuz I didn't expect to be that good because yeah well yeah you added in fresh ingredients so I think oh my god looks freaking amazing to birds yeah I love bread okay is there a shelter-in-place order yet no nope everyday I just rest my life making pizzas you know at work but rumor has it that it's supposed to be happening either tomorrow or Tuesday so fingers crossed and Rachel and I made dinner it was really really good like it turned out so good and I definitely want to do that recipe again in the future and I worked all day today and it was a pretty slow morning and then busy night kind of like it's been for the last couple of days in wacom county where i live the number went up from 10 cases to 19 just today go like that nearly doubled just today like how freaking terrifying is that but anyways I am currently reading undercover bromance and I'm loving it so much and I'm on chapter 18 I'm on page 206 and I'm buddy reading this with Jacqueline and we've been like sending mark and Marco Polo's like back and forth about it and I think she's she might have finished it already I don't know she's like a little bit ahead of where I'm at so I'm gonna catch up to where she's at and then Marco Polo her back and then hopefully finish it because I only have like that tiny bit left at the end okay it's like about a hundred pages but I really I'm loving it so much like I don't know if I'm loving it as much as the bromance book club but I'm loving it last night I did finish reading undercover bromance and it was really cute I gave it four stars and then today I just filmed a quick video the governor did it just post something on Twitter saying he's gonna go live to discuss things at 5:30 tonight so and last night the cases in my County went from 19 to 48 because because 32 people just got confirmed at this health center and um it's just really sad and it's getting really scary and so I'm hoping that tonight he will make that announcement  today was a day we got the really great news that the governor of Washington finally announced a shelter-in-place stay at home order and I was really relieved because I've been waiting for this order to come for a long time because I had assumed that it would be closing all non-essential jobs which is what I thought that I had then they said that restaurants will still be open for takeout and for carry out orders and I was like confused because I was like why would restaurants be considered an essential job like they're just not like in my mind like restaurants are not essential I just got like really bad anxiety and like the idea of going back to work right now as if nothing's going on it's just like impossible for me to deal with and so I actually called the owner of the restaurant that I worked for and I was just saying how me and my sister both don't feel very safe going to work right now especially with a stay at home order for the state and like there's just so many things happening in Washington like daily like the fact that the numbers jumped from 10 to 19 to 48 within three days in my County like it's just really scary and I just don't feel comfortable or safe being at work right now and so luckily the owners of the restaurant that I worked for are very understanding and it sucks because I know that I'm putting them in a hard place you know because I'm the freaking general manager and my sister is the assistant manager they've reached out to the staff and there's actually four of us total that don't feel safe being at work right now and we have a really small crew at the moment as it is so like I know that I'm putting a lot of extra stress on them and like I'm the kind of person that it causes me stress to know that I'm causing somebody else stress so like this whole situation is just kind of shitty and it sucks they are being understanding about it and I am going to be self isolating and stay in my apartment for the next two weeks because they announce that the stay at home order is effective until April 6th so like we'll see if things are different by April 6th freaking oh I'm really glad though that I spoke up and like said something because it was not good for my mental health to be like going to work every day as if nothing was going on and everything was fine and inside I was just like freaking terrified and I just don't want to like be part of the problem with like the things spreading you know because like I don't know if I'm carrying it like I still don't know like I could be right now and I just want show symptoms for like a couple days you know like you just never know and it's just really scary but now I just feel like such a relief knowing that at least I'm gonna be able to be home now it's just been a really stressful day because of dealing with that and I just really hate feeling like I'm letting people down like it's honestly the worst and I know I'm like harder on myself than anybody could ever be on me because I'm really hard on myself about this kind of I know that I'm doing the best thing my sanity it has been a pretty successful first day of quarantine for realsies today was the very first day that I got to stay at home all day free of any responsibilities I mean I did have one responsibility today I had to go drop off me and my sisters store keys to our restaurant so that the people that are still working right now can you know get into the building but uh other than that I was home all day and it was a really nice relaxing day I made myself some breakfast and then I got to take a bath in the afternoon which was very much needed and then I read a little bit out on the patio even though it's still a little bit too cold to be doing that these days but it was still really nice it was raining really hard while I was on the patio so it was just very lovely and then we watched five episodes of season four of this is us which is crazy because tonight was actually the season 4 finale of this is us but I didn't realize that we had fallen so behind on the show look I haven't actually watched this is us and probably like almost a year which is so crazy I didn't realize that we had an entire season basically to watch so we watched the first five episodes of season four and like mmm so so good I still am crying every single episode and I just honestly don't know how that show does it like for real it's just so good I still think that I think Randall is my favorite character still I just love that show so much and I love how it can make you care about characters that you didn't think you could give a about and how it introduces you to new characters and makes you give a about them the way that the show has parallels between the present in the past in the future it's just amazing the writing is amazing it's one of the best written shows I've ever watched also though today I tried to get into two different books I tried it to read the most fun we ever had I actually was trying to start a reading blog for this today but like it's really difficult for my brain to be able to focus on something like this book right now because I feel like before there are literary fiction books it takes a lot more concentration in my brain to be able to focus on a story like this so I just don't think I'm really in the mood for something like this right now but I yeah I only got ten pages into this book today then I also started reading the two lives of Lydia bird because me and Jack would have decided thought you wanted a buddy read this one next and I got sixty pages into this book and oh I'm just like really not feeling it I can't relate or connect at all with the characters and it just feels like really dull for me so far so like I don't know if I'm gonna continue reading this but anyways it was a really successful first day of quarantine and I'm just so thankful to be home right now like I can literally feel the stress leaving my body and it's great and it's very much needed and tomorrow I don't have too many plans but I am planning on filming my March book haul tomorrow and editing that and getting it ready to post and then I'm also gonna be doing this like a YouTube live show the thing with Jacqueline and a whole bunch of other booktubers it's gonna be like a two-hour long sit-in and hang out and read together kind of thing and it's gonna be a two-hour ish long thing and so I'm pretty excited for that I've never done like a hangout and really kind of live show format thing before so Jacqueline's hosting that on her channel so I'm really excited for that tomorrow and then hopefully we can watch another like five episodes of this is us because that show gives me life it is March 25th and it is about six o'clock at night right now and I just got done doing the live show like book hangout thing with Jacqueline and Chandler and Jessica and Gwen and so many book tubers that I watch which was really cool and then also so many book tubers who I have just met for the first time and it was really cool to be able to like hang out with ten different book tubers all at the same time I'll have to put a link in the description of this vlog if you missed it but it was really fun we just did like 30 minutes of like hanging out and just talking about what we were reading at the beginning and then we did an hour of just reading all together which was really fun and then another 30 minutes at the end of just like talking and hanging out and that group of girls was so much fun like I had so much freaking fun and we're gonna do another one next Friday on April 3rd and I can't wait I just made this great dinner Rachel made this mac and cheese and yes freakin so good you know it tastes even better hello again it is a little bit later in the night I have been watching this is us again all night we watched another five episodes tonight oh my gosh this show is gonna freakin kill me because it's just so good and I'm just so in love with this family like honestly this show just kind of like feels like home to me I love them all so much I just checked the news for the first time today because I've been like trying to avoid it you know just because like it's been making me very stressed and like really high anxiety anytime I look at it and now that I'm like home pretty much full time I've just been trying to find ways to like take my mind off of everything but I just checked and now there is 66 cases in my County which went up from 48 that it was like just yesterday or the day before definitely climbing in my County and it's really scary and I've just been reading all these like articles about how in New York right now like their hospitals are getting so overwhelmed and how there's literally people that are dying in the waiting room waiting to get a bed in the hospital and I've just been watching like these different videos coming out of Italy of all of the doctors that are you know doing their best and working endless hours to try and save these people and God it is just so awful in the world right now like it is so awful and it almost makes me feel like guilty to try to find ways to distract myself because I feel like this is something that deserves my attention you know but it's also like it's just so hard to be thinking about constantly and I know it's like it's something like I have to take care of my mental health - but like oh yeah 2020 is just not once a year like it it's just not a good time like I thought January was bad okay January was like a very shady start to the year for me like I just wasn't in the best mood all month I had a really shitty reading month and then Kobe Bryant died that month and then February was just such a busy work month for me that it was just crazy stressful like February was so freaking stressful I then March first the first day of March I got the stomach flu and it was awful and I was out for like four days I haven't been sick like that in years and so it was just freaking awful and honestly like March has felt like the longest month because I can't believe that that was happening at the beginning of this month like if I had gotten that sick during this crazy coronavirus I would have been losing my mind then of course like immediately after I started to get better the corona virus just started spreading and it got to my county by March 10th and ever since then it's just kind of all been feeling like I just can't believe this is all real you know like that's just my state of mind lately is that I just honestly like I have trouble like digesting like this and thinking like how is this all real like this just seems so horrific and crazy it's like real life has like turned into a horror movie or something you know I'm sorry to end it on such a sad note but it's kind of a sad time in the world right now and it's kind of hard to pretend that it's not you know so so yeah I'm gonna end these vlogs here I just want to know like how you guys are doing and how you're holding up with everything that's going on just know that it's okay to take breaks from the news and take care of your mental health and and it's important to stay safe and stay home I don't know just know that I'm thinking about all of you and especially like oh my god all the people that are still working right now and all the like doctors and nurses that are literally risking their lives to save everyone else like they're the freakin real heroes but yeah anyways I'm gonna call it a night and this will be the end of this vlog so thank you guys so much for watching and hanging out with me for a little bit and I will see you very soon with a new video
