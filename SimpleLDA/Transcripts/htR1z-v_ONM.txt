  moving  still doing laundry to the very end it's moving day we've lived in New York now for several years we've loved the city we've loved and hated it at times it's just weird to think that we're actually leaving we've been planning like oh we're gonna move to California we're gonna move here we're gonna move there but today's the actual day all packed up all right still got the beard check out the beard oh my goodness  it's a mess in here  it's ugly in here Bert there's nothing to absorb the sound Bart sighs by beautiful New York City view Emily my best friend lives in that building right across the street do you guys get sad when you move like when you move cities or when you move homes like it's exciting but it's also so sad we've been here for so many years like in New York we love the city why did you say oh man this is getting up the dustbunnies this is done done guys empty condo tour officially moved and we are in LA in Washington DC we didn't end up moving to California just huh yeah the virus has affected so many people on so many different levels it definitely affected us we weren't able to move to California but instead Bart accepted a job and we have moved and purchased this condo and we're in DC oh no furniture yet we are still waiting on the movers but look the Cable Guy came without the TV we have internet we've got we've got rugs that I ordered off West Elm and then Amazon so kind of a more expensive one and a budget-friendly one and we'll see how those work out we bought a plan already I saw that and I was like that kind of looks like a palm tree like very like California e so we picked that up Bart's already working and this is one of the bedrooms I have my flight attendant luggage it's actually like five o'clock right now and today is Tuesday it's five o'clock on a Tuesday and the movers are actually coming between 5:00 and 7:00 it's so random this condo that we got is two bedrooms two baths so it's a little bit bigger than our New York apartment definitely the view the view is more like a street view so you guys can see the little houses they're so cute there are all these like little row homes it's gonna be interesting guys I can't I don't think I'll be I'll do like a full condo tour for you guys just yet he got rid of so much furniture in New York that had been you know just with us for so long that was kind of damaged and so we're in the process of ordering all new furniture we don't even have bed frames do not we had to get rid of our bed frame because it was like from Ikea like probably about like five years old and it had moved with us like four times so we got rid of that and we're actually finally able to upgrade to a king bed king sized bed because this is so big this is huge you guys I don't know if you can tell you can't you can't tell it to scale yet because there's no furniture in there but it's really big super excited its 638 movers just got here I feel like I've never done a move where the movers come at night is this like a normal thing have you guys like ever done that I feel like this is really odd it's happening yeah packing that's going to commence tomorrow though it's this is this is already this looks really organized right now but it's gonna get crazy and what time is it 7:22 been unpacking for like a week straight old condo over here was just like filled with boxes we've got a lot of furniture coming this weekend so that's exciting we're getting and new like bigger table trying to get a good shot for you guys so this is our table that we've had this table for like three years we got this table when we had our studio apartment in New York City I ordered a big table here from cb2 that's actually gonna be delivered tomorrow so I'll show you guys that when it gets here Franny loves being able to look outside I just got this like cute little thing here for like the entryway this is from Target you guys and this was like a hundred and like 25 dollars and it's like the perfect size here so we can put our keys and stuff when we walk in so this is the guest bedroom here I don't think I showed you guys this room but this is like the overflow of stuff that we have so much of this stuff has to go to storage unfortunately DC is a lot like New York City and there's just not a lot of storage in these like small narrow row houses oh my gosh it's my allergies in DC are so bad do you see my eyes and they have been red and my nose has been like itchy ever since we've got here and I like can't stop sneezing yeah we got a converted row home so it's like a long and narrow home but there isn't a lot of like storage space so with all of this that we have here we actually have to get a storage unit so we're gonna go actually we're gonna go tomorrow to kiss sweetie because I don't bar I'm like I I can't I can't look in that room it's so out of control but this is cool we actually like a full-size refrigerator we've even had that in so long we've got this big stove we don't we don't even like know what to make on it and look there's five burn awesome oh I've literally been on hold for 53 minutes with world-market I ordered these glasses and this one came broken so I was like I just need one replacement it's a long long time and hold okay Frannie is gonna get a little room here I'm probably gonna hang some pictures here and like his little mirror from I don't even know if you guys remember his room from our studio apartment uh I was gonna get in you one of these like TV cadenzas but we actually set it up here and it looks fine it doesn't look it actually looks like it really fits we got a new plant we had to leave had to leave our plants in New York the moving company would not transport our plants and so we gifted them to our neighbors and friends but I'm like do you know how long it took me to grow there was this snake plant the ones that go straight up we had had it for three years and I have loved it and watered it and nurtured it and I go so we got that new plant we got that one and then we have the one in the other room that we don't have a spot for yet green chair made it I wasn't sure about it I wasn't sure the color was gonna stay we are waiting on a new coffee table I ordered these little tables but do you look a little small like when you sit here it's a long way to put a glass or something down there really cute though they were fairly inexpensive and we got them from all modern I cannot believe we packed this lamp I told Bart there's no way that lamp is gonna make it in one piece and it totally did and we've also had that lamp since since our studio apartment okay this is our bedroom right now you guys this is a mess right now we don't have a bed frame and this is a Queen mattress so we actually have a bed frame and a king mattress coming tomorrow so we're gonna move this out of here and we're gonna put that bed is eventually gonna go that mattress is gonna go in the guest bedroom down there and I ordered a new queen bed but it's on backorder so it's not gonna be here for a while so this is our home but this is our new little home it's it's so exciting we've been renting in New York for so long and the rents were outrageous in New York City just outrageous I mean you guys know last year they tried to raise our rent by $500 this year they want to raise our rent by $700 and we were just like you know what and that is enough like we're just we're not gonna pay that we're not gonna do that so we saved all last year and we saved enough for a down payment so we actually own this home this is ours we own it every time we pay rent or mortgage like it's to us so nobody's gonna raise our rent next year it's on us if we want to pay a little bit more we can on our mortgage but we're not getting these crazy increases in rent I've been having a lot of fun ordering some furniture few pieces of furniture coming tomorrow so I will show you guys that tomorrow and then I'll end the blog but I want to show you guys those pieces because they're really cute this is so exciting wow this looks great it's a great color so we got this bed frame from West Elm and the mattress here is from tempur-pedic the Bart's had this other tempur-pedic bed for literally like ten years and it is the best bed I've ever slept on Franny you love the new bed you're not really supposed to be on it until we put some sheets but okay here is the coffee table that I ordered from cv2 I'm gonna be so honest I'm gonna be honest guys it's a little short compared to the couch not sure we'll keep it another mistake love this table also got it from cb2 really cool like hairpin legs here but too big it's gonna have to go back also wah-wah-wah perfect alright guys so the next day another another shirt hair is been in a business fun for probably the last two weeks straight I have not taken it out of this business fun because I'm I'm doing business right now I'm moving the delivery guy barely closed the door before I was like on the phone with CB to like know that coffee tables not gonna work and that dining table way to pitch I got the 80 inch dining table and I needed to get the 53 inch dining table so I switched it so they're bringing that one and taking this one away it's really hard to shop for furniture online it's hard to get the exact measurements I mean it's just hard to visualize seeing the stuff in the spaces like I didn't realize that it's gonna be so ridiculously big if you guys have any design tips for me please let me know design tips for small spaces this is bigger than our old place but it still is small so I'm still trying to be creative with where with what pieces to get that kind of act as storage but also give us a sense of like openness I get to the most like opposite
