 so it's been a couple days since I've been socially distancing and I'm bored I decided to do like quarantine Diaries I'm gonna go blackhead remover playground and vlog my days 1 because I feel like it'll make my time not doing anything more fun and 2 I'm gonna try to figure out what to do when you are socially distancing and just chilling at home I want to look at this through a positive light I personally love spending time with myself like I love having excuse not to leave my house however it's been quiet it's it's day 3 and it's you know I'm feeling all the vibes it's like crazy hour for me like I'm feeling the social distancing within myself happy birthday happy birthday dear name can you please wish for the coronavirus to end are just kidding do your own wish  so it wasn't us birthday yesterday and all her gifts a ride today so I'm gonna go over to her room and give them all to her I want to get her things that I feel like she could also use during her time inside the house so let's see what she thinks of it I feel like I'm so much more excited about her gifts like I hope she lets me use them can I come hey girl so I just wanted to bring you your birthday gift scared don't be scared it's not scary do they work what do you mean obviously it's in a brand new box it's it's a black head back humour ah how did you know I wanted one of these really you wanted one yeah I told mom like five months ago it's a silk pillow it's like a face it comes with these like blackhead remover this is like super good for your skin to sleep on and for your hair so basically I got you like a little self-care kit since you're spending a lot of time inside okay whoa I look like some kind of police girl social distancing is important but that doesn't mean that you have to be cooped up in your house all day you can actually go on walks out in nature okay guys see you just make sure you're six feet away from people it's important to go and get some fresh air some vitamin D because other DS are lacking in this time of need it's really great having foreign parents that don't know what you're saying me and my mom walking my dog we're gonna go to the park I'm gonna see if I can get some Instagram pics for content since I'm also clearly lacking on that just jacks lift Hurley run to the other side of the sidewalk because he's afraid he's gonna get hit by a car  as you can see the playgrounds all blocked off same with that one in that one Jax is literally the dog from Doug's car oh well can we just take a moment this is what Jax looks like when he's running up close it's so much energy yeah social isolation sucks but I feel like I normally don't go to the park my mom and my dog I think social distancing has reminded me the basics that I've missed out on when I'm so caught up in the fast pace of the world and having a bunch of things to do for Sammi like    go ahead and open up all my PR packages I was like honestly I'm tired of waiting for more packages to come I'm just gonna open this and throw it in the quarantine Diaries so we have this not silver package also I sprayed all my packages just in case oh yeah some skincare goodies come first a beauty oh my god this is an ultra Repair Cream and let me talk about this I like get X Mon really random parts of my body this winter for the first time it was on my face around my eye specifically says relieve minor irritation itching due to eczema and other conditions I tried it out and it actually worked I feel like having so much time at home has given me time to like put more effort and time into my skincare routine and my pamper routine so I've been playing around with the product so this is a great opportunity for you guys to like recreate your skincare routine awesome possum Thank You first aid beauty this is quite the dress a cute bikini I'll wear indoors I guess from now on revolve I think I actually picked these out before I found out that I have to spend literally the next month at home so might include some coachella options in here will sneak peak into October how friggin cute campus to wear that and mm hide i cropped hoodie this is from lovers and friends also there's something in my brain where every time I see tie-dye and like it stimulated and I'm like mirror I need it I think it's because I never went to camp and I never really did tie-dye as a child so I'm like catching up on it I always forget that the models that are like modeling the dresses are probably like five nine and i'm 5-4 so it's probably not gonna look like that on me and then i realized that once i actually get an in person and i'm like oh so it's not a maxi skirt okay when i travel to my front yard that'll be awesome and we continue this is from foreo okay so it's like this electronic mask applier thing it's a LED thermo activated smart mask it like heats up your mask on it so it melts into your skin or something like that so think of it like kind of like an expresso machine Oreo has their like mass pod and you like pop it onto there I'll figure this out okay functional beauties like customizable shampoos and conditioners that I was running out I'm obsessed with fresh Beauty I literally could get married to all their products like I don't think I've ever used any of their products that I've been like I don't like that Haley enjoy her best-selling soy face cleanser I was in a campaign with my mom for their soy face cleanser if you're gonna get anything out of my channel the soy face cleanser will change your life it's like the number one selling cleanser in Sephora I've gone way too many people hooked onto the soy face cleanser and because of that and they know I have a bunch of them in my house every time someone comes here they're like oh

want an American Girl doll but like my parents never got me one cuz they thought it was like the stupidest thing to spend your money on I would literally be so sad once they like let me get something from the American Girl store and I had like a twenty dollar budget or something what can you get at the American Girl store for like less than 20 dollars like literally nothing you could probably get your doll like out of scrunchie but they had these like American Girl lip glosses and I was like yes I'm gonna own something from American Girl and it wasn't even a doll it was a lip gloss um so what was I saying this tastes like that lip gloss literally I was 7 or like 8 and here we are again well I'm keeping this it's this brand called Lodi freckle tint let's see if this has the potential of
