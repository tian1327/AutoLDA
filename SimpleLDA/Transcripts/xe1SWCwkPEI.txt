 hi guys so I was recently asked how I get my groceries living in New York City during this pandemic and there are three main ways that I get my groceries one way being drive all the way to Queens to grocery stores that have parking lots and buy groceries there and that is exactly what I'm doing right now I'm in the car with my mom we're on our way to the stop and shopping Queen to get some stuff for the week I believe my mom wants to stock up on some seltzer water since there's a shortage of co2 in the country the other way is go into local grocery stores that are within walking distance and wait in the long lines to get into the grocery store and buy some stuff so we don't do that very often because we're kind of discouraged from going outside and also because we've been also using instacart which is a grocery store app that allows you to get grocery stores delivered to your house and we've been doing that a lot since quarantine and I will speak a little more about instacart later because I actually started working for instacart as a shopper also so you guys know the governor announced a few days ago that in New York State you must wear a mask in a public so that includes her she stores MTA outside anything so when I was going down to the car I had to wear a mask the elevator and everything like that and of course when I go into the grocery store I'll have to put it back on but in the car were okay so we're here now and this is the parking lot it's actually not too bad not too many people here back the car so there's a lot of stuff here I'm very surprised we're getting a lot of fruit my favorite avocado I need an orange for a new flan recipe with a flan recipe and the mac and cheese recipe this ginger looks like a lobster so it looks like they don't have bok choy that's to do without it weird robot thing moving the alternative milks look kind of empty I actually really like almond milk we're good on almond milk so we don't have to buy an H Lee don't drink regular milk I only drink almond milk and soy milk mostly first result some water ultra water selection it's also pretty alone however we found the fancy stuff the brand of seltzer we usually get but they don't have the plain one they're all different flavors for spring sparkling water we're gonna try that because it's cheaper but we're still gonna get the Perrier like one-way directions for each aisle so in this aisle we all have to go that way and we were going the opposite way so that's kind of embarrassing little announcement on the intercom about the one-way aisles we're going the right way baking aisle is pretty empty everyone's been baking in quarantine still have a pretty decent selection of rice Mayo fence on the bench no toilet paper in New York City so no paper towel here just empty shell it's like vegetarian noodle it's pretty good Evie everything on the list and more except for the ladyfingers they didn't have that but yeah we pulled hard they have eaten it all for just waiting here to be call about the register so this is all her stuff bagged back in the car and it was a pretty successful trip we got most of everything that we wanted they didn't have bok choy and they didn't have like lady singers and they also didn't have cilantro but it's okay we got a lot of extra stuff and we should be good for a while so now that we're done with bursary shopping we're going to a drive through Starbucks since most of the Starbucks in Manhattan are closed so currently waiting in line very very long you can't even see the Starbucks so now that I got my Starbucks I'm gonna go into detail about instacart so like I said before I'm now in its heart shopper and I work at the fairway so what this means is when somebody orders an online delivery through the instacart app from the fairway store I'm one of the people who are in charge of getting all their items for their order I don't deliver the items that I'm just the shopper and I started this yesterday and I'm pretty good we have a very low stock to chew everybody buying everything it's been really nice knowing that I'm giving back to the community and doing my parts in this very trying time I'm considering all different options for my career and what I'm supposed to do for my life and what I want to do I'm reconsidering considering law school and I'm also considering maybe nursing I don't know we'll see for that I would have to go back to undergrad for a year for the PX I don't know it's a very confusing time in my life and in the world thank you guys for watching stay safe and I'll see you next time
