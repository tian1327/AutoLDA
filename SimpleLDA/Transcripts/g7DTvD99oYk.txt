 so notice start painting think I may need to what sounds some of the pains here today in New York is Brooklyn Queens day it was a day that all the schools public schools would be closed it was a holiday they changed it so that the teachers were but the students are raw I think it's also related to queens and kings queens is like Queen and Brooklyn is Kings the borough of Kings so I don't know I don't know what the history is it would be interesting to look that up it's always the first Thursday of June so there's lots of staff development but students are off today and we're winding down to the end of the semester even though some people already graduated and three months since the shutdown of the city and it will be the opening phase one on Monday the stressful time and I guess I know that we have to look for young people to make a difference and make change in a positive way it's just kind of be hopeful again not much to say it's hard to well that's going on is a little overwhelming it's hard to think of much else I just hope for positive change not just hope be a part of it I did receive my paper ballot to open it up I hope I mentioned that yesterday to vote I'd like going to the voting place and may have still have gone but since I have this I will do this instead it's just better because you don't know someone's gonna be sick you know meaning like sick and they can't go so they have the ballot so they can vote so that's what I chose to do it Lee I will be well but just seems fine I just received the it's virtual it was very nice a newsletter from Westside arts collection which is an autist group I belong to in Manhattan several years in many years now really I was supposed to be in the show and it was right with the shutdown would have been the end of March so they came out with the newsletter instead featuring all the artists it was kind of nice to see the newsletter and they wrote a nice little write-up about each artist so it was really yeah they did a beautiful job things spiritual and I mean another virtual show in Milan but and the beat goes on la da da da dun dun please be safe when you go out think of others it ain't over yet wear your mask keep your social distance wash your hands you always have to wash I hands this is fun to paint and having fun playing with the color here really like just to dry so I could come back in and get some definition we actually watch season 1 but we watching season 2 of my brilliant friend it's in Italian the subtitles and it takes place and Naples it's a book series there's four books and they made it into a TV series but when watching it it's really kind of captures life and history it's Italian history but you can also relate it to so many just knowing that and thinking of it that way how these two friends if you look at it kind of symbolize change and how things happen even in the world it's a little dense you know it's like when you're reading it so I really didn't you know just kind of have the first book here I'm watching the TV series there's so many different names it's like ooh what wait what was that it's a lot of dialect in it but helping me with always trying up my game in my Italian so it's like I'm just hearing it and knowing it I think I heard a lot of dialect even not that I understood it really well but little things that I'm picking up so it's fun it's on HBO so a lot of symbolism definitely worth watching a lot of good references and I recommend it I'm sitting here recommending that remember Ebert and Cisco going to the movies sometimes it was a half-hour TV series where they would review movies and often I'd watch it just before I'd be going out to a movie that was a big no it still is but well not now while staying home watching TV series but going to the movies and I really enjoyed them they did great reviews and they would bicker too as kind of they want to be very good friends it's fun to watch and watch a review of a movie yes definitely a stick sometimes I just like kind of playing with the color know what I mean by fun it's just like what just the way it goes on the page and I could get lost in it I read this post it was very upsetting I think it was not meant to be this way yeah respond to it or at least not yet because I'm not sure how to do it without being super angry but it was like I don't understand why everyone's getting so upset we're all the same I don't know I guess it's like people being killed no regard to life could be the reason why everyone's getting a little upset or should be the water is pooling any type and P that's what I like this is 140-pound paper but I like 300-pound paper I always found history fascinating see how things repeat themselves nothing's changed well 2020 be a major change in the world that's a little bit of a tent to soften that white up put a little green in there why it's good I want to I want to  little dab a green over there I have the little flowers in the towel so let's try and be upbeat huh and let's stay healthy kind and promote positive change how's that a little bit keep going really purpley in there so thanks again for tuning in please subscribe if you haven't leave a comment have a wonderful day I will have some healthy beats I think they're full of iron and stay healthy stay safe take care
