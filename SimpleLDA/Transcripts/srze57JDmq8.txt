    these are some truly crazy times we are living through beyond wonderland a ETM event was canceled of course as just like everything else was canceled and they're actually having a lineup of DJs by insomniac they're streaming it for free on YouTube and they're putting up like sanitized hands in the air signs and after every DJ is done there's a guy who is going to the turntables and this is disinfecting like all the equipment and it's just really bizarre to see man it's like it's like something out of a movie we're living out of a movie right now like one of those like contagion it's just crazy like it's something you wouldn't think of that you would see in your lifetime and we're living through it so I don't know weird times   Dallas County will move to a safer at home worker this is also known as a shelter-in-place order this order is our best chance to flatten a curb here in Dallas County and save as many lives as possible hey what's up guys I haven't really I've logged too much today it is March 22nd this is like day 4 of quarantine just not a lot going on today so I really didn't want to hop on the camera and just bore you guys but as of an hour ago Dallas County finally issued a shelter at home order starting March 23rd at midnight meaning that you cannot leave your house unless you have an essential job you care for a pet or another family member that needs the assistance your grocery shopping getting essentials and that's it if you do not work in any of these fields and you are not out getting groceries or essentials then you cannot be outside I think this order is going through April 3rd but it could be prolonged depending on the situation and if dumbasses keep going out and partying at their friends houses that is not social distancing stay your ass at home apart from as many people as possible you guys out there doing these things are the reason why this disease keeps spreading if everybody just did their part and stayed inside like they were supposed to then we would probably be better off right now and we have to learn from Italy and other places that didn't pay attention because Spring Breakers here in the US did definitely did not pay attention another coming back positive for coronavirus and we have to be better as human beings and do our part men like isolation for a few weeks is a small price to pay for the betterment of mankind like I've said before and many many times again so yeah I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing I'm staying indoors trying to keep keep healthy try not to eat as much junk which is hard when you're locked indoors following some good for home workouts that they've been posting and yeah I guess we'll see where we go from here    guys it is Wednesday March 25th and today I have to venture out for the first time in like a while to go get essentials I got a hit a couple grocery stores and on a scale from 1 to shook I'm kind of shook man like I never thought in my entire life that I would be scared to go to the grocery store but that's just the reality that we're living in right now my plan is to take sandy wipes with me and in a little a ziploc bag just in case not taking gloves because apparently like gloves cause away too much cross-contamination I am gonna take some hand sanitizer I've got a portable one right here my plan is to get in and out get the essentials and if it's too busy I'm just gonna hit the next door because I don't want to wait in line with a bunch of people and yeah so might film a little bit I don't know but wish me luck first trip out to get essentials in a while so here we go   been outside in a while like days upon days and makes you realize just how much you take like going out for granted grocery shopping for granted all these little things that we used to do on the daily that we're just trivial aren't so trivial now nothing's trivial and even grocery shopping is a kind of a relief and a scare kind of shook out here and a lie but uh stocking up on groceries for a while so this will be the last trip in a long time so so yeah I just left Whole Foods go into what is this Kroger Tom Tom Tom Thumb next I'm picking the places that are a little bit more expensive so they're less crowded I think it's a good strategy I don't know so far it's been okay a couple of people weren't really respecting the social distancing thing and uh at Whole Foods but I tried my best to get away from everybody so I discovered something     what's up my fellow quarantine errs well at least all you non-essential people who I should joke but it's I'm just trying to make light of the situation my heart goes out to all the essential workers out there they're risking their lives daily while we are here in quarantine much love to you guys bed is now Friday March 27th I believe man to be honest days are just blending together and yesterday I didn't even know what day it was that's how time doesn't matter when you're indoors really like everything just blends together I'm getting up at weird times I'm going to sleep later than usual my insomnia has gotten worse but overall I mean it's not so bad like I said many times before if you're a nerd you have plenty of things to do indoors and so far I haven't run out of things to do I think I am on day I don't even know man it's been a while I know it's been over a week at least these vlogs are going out kind of sporadically the timeline is somewhat correct like I'm skipping days vlogging for sure cuz some days I just don't even know what to say a lot of the same old you know but today I decided to pick up the camera and vlog I made a cool video modding my razor headset last night so I'm gonna put it put that out but that's probably already out by the time you see this vlog but alright man let's just get into some daily things Captain's Log day 13 food is becoming scarce the rations are running out I don't know what to do anymore I'm constantly hungry searching for rations the pops they they're starting to turn their back on me I don't know what to do anymore they have overthrown me as their leader their leader is now Broly no longer calling the shots I don't know what to do I don't know how much longer I can last in this quarantine days are beginning to blend together is that Tuesday is it Saturday I don't know and honestly who cares doesn't matter anymore all I know is that this quarantine is not that bad I am having a good-ass time
