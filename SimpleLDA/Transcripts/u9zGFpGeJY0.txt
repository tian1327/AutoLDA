 so in 2019 we did our best to stay away from negative people its 2020 now we're trying to stay away from positive people  hey there Graham came here my work has had me traveling back and forth to Europe for weeks now and it's been pretty crazy watching the changes that taken place since this whole COBIT 19 thing has really really kicked off you know Europe is actually getting it a little bit harder than the US but they're also taking a little more seriously so on that note yeah you people all need to be out there and be safe this is a real thing I've traveled several places in the world Europe and South America predominantly since this has really been going on and yeah it's affecting everywhere places I've seen in Europe that are normally bustling centers of activity our waste lands there's nothing going on it's it's completely post-apocalyptic over here but I was got here yesterday slept most of the day in the hotel because after flying all night I was kind of tired and then today we discovered that we're staying another day so I ran out of all the food I brought with me I ordered some food for delivery early on the day and then I slept and then by the time I woke up it was too late or anything else for debris so yeah I've been in this hotel and picked up some other stuff but today I'm gonna go pick up a few groceries just something to snack on and yeah cuz I'm hungry and not sure how much longer we'll be here and I don't know if where we're going next it will have access to food it's definitely been an experience I can tell you lots of places aren't open lots of places are open for delivery only I've ended up in hotels where there's like no food available at all obviously no one wants to touch anything or be around you and heaven forbid if you call you know you've obviously got the plague well as is common in Europe you can just open the windows and stuff but you can see down here it's actually a quite a busy street and you can see it's really not that busy over here is a kingdom locks and you can see all the restaurants and stuff there along locks or all shut down so let's let's go check it out and see what we see there's a whole lot of nothing going on right now so we were in a London right now Camden Lock wherever it was like nothing going on this place is usually hoppin and as you can see it's dead we're in like the peak of the whole corona shenanigans but here for like a day and I eat all my portable food and we were supposed to be leaving today but we're staying another day so walk into the grocery store to get some more food yep yeah I got a couple people over here waiting for coffee and stuff it looks like but yeah it should be busy and we're not gonna walk in front of this truck because that's what I do Oh Colin there you go buddy yeah man Apple Maps has led me astray yet again so I probably to a neighborhood and not the store so I'm actually kind of eyeballing it to the store now instead people still driving around but there's not many of them here's the bus there's people on the bus yeah and that back there is actually the line down the street for the grocery store so yeah people are getting pretty nice and flight though please lock the hell down I'm just be clear I'm out because I needed groceries so that's a London right now basically so I hope you all are up there surviving the apocalypse as best you can oh yeah rock on stay safe well done my good deed for the day I'm feeding these pigeons of bagels so he's actually holding a block of ice even though from the other side looks like he's peeing he got my groceries I still have a couple little snacks in my room but uh ordered some food last night for delivery and it showed up without any drinks and even though I ordered some drinks so instead of bringing me more drinks they just took the drinks off the price of my order which didn't really do you any good I've Celestia's health keeping with the stay indoors theme I'm sure somebody's gonna take an online class I got nothing else to do here England today you know I'm just a guy with the camera and unfortunately have a little more uh no - but epidemiology that I would probably like at this point but you know everyone be safe out there and seriously take this thing seriously it is affecting people in more ways than one and you know the more we can stay indoors and you know limit exposure others the quicker this thing's gonna be over with it we can all get back to normal okay so everyone be safe out there and take care of yourselves thanks for watching
