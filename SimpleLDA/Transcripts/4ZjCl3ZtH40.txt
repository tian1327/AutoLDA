  showers early Friday  hey guys welcome or welcome back to Rachel's life I'm Rachel and today I'm going to be doing and just said well chill log to action Memorial Day so we're going to go in a little family picnic hence the fact I'm in my dress actually that made sense I'm just gonna wear a dress because I feel like it it's this really cute sundress from Old Navy so yeah but first I'm gonna do some makeup and just some Medicus no no no no no no anyways I'm gonna do some light makeup just feel more fresh in that I mean and literally just gonna do a blush highlighter bronzer and then I think that's in mascara and like eyebrows ease up and let's see it so yeah how are you guys if you guys are doing good I wash on my makeup brushes yesterday so that's nice that they're clean because I hadn't washed them in a really long time which is not a good thing back anyways but I started my morning off pretty or my afternoon I woke up late I didn't go to bed till like 3:00 obviously not quite sure why I didn't go to bed and I was like up reading I'm currently reading this book called love dies by bog off it's a really good book I actually started reading it sometime like I think before Christmas and I guess now started picking it back up I'll get in like phases where I start reading a book and then I like forget about it or something I'm not quite sure but it's a really good book and I encourage you guys to read it he the way he writes it's really easy to understand and it's also really easy to like I don't know like getting all din I feel like some people like when they write it's just like you get along I'm like not knowing what you're reading and it's just like not fun but like he makes it like I feel like fun and interactive and he's really funny and he's just a really good author so I'm like his book down below for you guys and yeah he also has another one called everybody always I think which I also have that but it's kind of a sequel I think to love does so I'm reading love does first and then I'll read the next one but yeah so in case you guys are wondering for my blush I'm using the fluence by Mills creamy cheek blush and this is in the shade stellar Sabrina I'll link it down below for you guys I really liked it when I got it I was a little hesitant because I was like oh data like I don't know like it but I do really like it it works well and it's really easy to smooth out and like if you put too much on it's really easy to take off which I like because I've had I've tried a plethora of power blushes and almost all of them were like way too pigmented and then I can't get them off of everything but yeah and then for my bronzer and highlight I'm using Deanna stars you have Beverly Hills glow kit Sun dipped um I got it for Christmas so I got it for Christmas you know I actually like it it's pretty good I'm not a big bronzer person I don't really know how to know we just some fool send it you know what I mean and I don't like to bronze too much because I don't look like I don't know like a really bronzed up person like this isn't even really considered bronzing I just add color and you could say like it's just I don't know so I'm no makeup expert and I also don't like covering my face and makeup because I don't know I feel people should be confident in our own skin and Arnold saying makeup is bad but I usually don't do much makeup Julius I swear if you jump up here so that's as much bronzing as I'm doing you can't even tell that I've lost um I'm gonna do more on the side of my face we're actually did I mention we're going on a picnic yeah I did so my parents are how can I know I'm no clue what they're making or hacking anyways nobody's number to do some I liked and I do like my highlight brush to be wet but I don't have anything that can read it right now so I do like cream highlights like I have a liquid highlighter from Pacifica but it's a little bit purpley color so there's a shirt right there there what yeah just like a peanut butter and jelly okay my brother just came in here looking for clothes cuz I've got a laundry room if you're wondering Dalarna it was like cuz I'm in an Airbnb in the laundry rooms that connected to my room it's I've never really seen anything like that before it's not bad it's just different you know I mean but I tried a new coffee my dad got it for me yesterday he ran to the store with like a mask on himself we usually never go to the store now but there are some things we didn't get in our Walmart pick up order that we wanted for Memorial Day organic coffee because I heard I will link this book down below it's called living in the chemical a just by what's her name I forget her name um I like it down below any raise but she is basically a council free like person like she's like really emphasizes like on what she eats and what she puts in her body when she uses in her house and she has a full book on it and I think she said that coffee is one of like the most heavily like pesticide like food I'm not I'm trying to say but it has the most pesticides compared like some other things so that was so scary for me and pesticides really just aren't good they can cause really bad health effects they can cause brain tumors and cancers and like birth defects and stuff like that so it's best to stay away from pesticides if you can't get organic if you've followed me for quite a bit on my channel you probably know that I've tried to make a lot more conscious effort to have most of my products be clean and chemical free my eating is getting there this past quarantine has kind of made it hard I think to like not be so strict about what I eat but I'm trying to eat a more whole food plant-based diet and yeah and then I also have done away with toxic products in my skincare regimen and stuff like that so my mom trimmed my eyebrows yesterday you probably can't tell but I can tell the difference and I love it in case were wondering that's that I don't think you were but in case you were but yeah and I tried to make my makeup products more clean but to be honest clean makeup is this expensive which I understand why I know of a good clean makeup brand if you guys are struggling to finding one Pacifica Beauty is a really good one I'll link their website down below I have perfumes by then which I'll actually use one today there's just a really good brand and their stuff is super affordable it's not like to break the bank type of stuff but I'm going to finish my makeup finish this in the time lapse and I will see you guys when I'm done  hey guys basically a PVR at this little water Omaha's up site rather it's like streams and it's really pretty and it's beautiful but it's also really loud so I hope you guys can hear me cuz I can barely hear myself so um yeah but it's super P where we're at so there's just like this above section I don't know and then down here is the stream and everything that's going on right there there's a stream everything in it so pretty luckily it isn't raining because there was kind of a chance it was like sprinkling but the Sun is our streets he's down a little bit so that's nice we've had a little picnic I had a peanut and jelly sandwich yeah should I get peanut butter and jelly you just like crackers and cheese and stuff so it was really good a good little memorial bake it away in corn over that country in quarantine of course um yeah but it's so pretty here I also took some self-timer photos so stopped over the way and I've always taught them up on the screen for you guys to do but yeah so it's really fun here it's really pretty I'm gonna show you guys best stream a little bit so you guys can see if you please so pretty great you guys my brother to school rocking the water Sookie so hope you guys can hear me well we're gonna head back now because I think there might be a rain shower soon so that would not be fun to get caught in hey guys so I am back home now it is horrible it is 6:20 and back home our hike or it wasn't really hiked we kind of an ape we did a picnic and then we kind of hiked we just kinda like trekked along through the woods it was actually really pretty and really fun at my hair is frizzy so don't mind that but I'm back home you know with my baby uh-huh he's acting so weird I was sitting outside on the swing with my mom and I came inside and he was like running all around so that must mean he was doing something bad and I'm pretty sure I did catch him like in a closet because I think I like so I'm running out from there because he's not really supposed to be in there because he has peed on clothes in his past and you know we kind of gave him a little warning I don't know but I just know he I think I'm going to own on off choice yeah I think I'm going to give him a tree cuz today's his clinical birthday um-huh birthday see how did you blog see how you did I see hi I'm sure they love you hmm yeah blonde tree come on let's go tree all right guys let's get about tree you don't love this see if you got  nobody's that look good to you guys good you back so now I'm tired sorry lighting is bad I'm tired now I think we're going to eat dinner in a little bit we're gonna grill and the whole thing I'm really sad about to be honest like I think just this holiday has really taken an effect on me because I know that I know last year I was with my family and it's a bit like this year that isn't the case because of quarantine and stuff and we're obviously doing it for good but it's kind of sad in the moment because you're like why can't I be with family but the future is obviously unknown and uncertain but I don't know so just keep that in mind stay home so like I said we're doing this for good and yeah but it's just it's kind of sad and not setting me cut um because you just want to be with your family and friends and stuff but we're gonna get through it it's gonna be fine we're it's gonna we're not gonna be out of corn needs to move and later I'm claiming it but yeah so we're just gonna chill I guess you know I'll see you guys in a little bit whenever something more exciting happens hi hey guys so it is
