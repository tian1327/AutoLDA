 why are you embarrassed that I'm vlogging like this looking like this up she's like not at all hello guys and welcome to the vlog I'm Jessica Torres and actually let me get ready cuz I don't want to show the vlog looking like this hot mess I just wanted to do a daily vlog I'm considering doing many daily blogs like be a daily vlogger for like a little bit I don't know if it's actually gonna happen it's an idea um today I'm just gonna do my makeup and I'm gonna bring you along we're still in quarantine obviously but my girlfriend is going to be moving strand of all tuning plates over my go see an apartment we're gonna take all the precautions that we can so I wanna bring you guys along do on my day and show you what we're gonna be making for lunch and dinner and yeah but I don't want to look like this anymore so I'll be right back let me go shower and maybe show you guys what I'm gonna do if I make them city is there something fun maybe I don't know alright so I still haven't gone into the shower but I'm pulling out accessories that I want to wear this is I have that you guys just won my vlogs on Monday my video from the knee and then this fact that my girlfriend gave me it was the fact that she just had to store away and she like stored away and she never really used it so I'm trying to see if I want to wear this or this oh that's my cousin but a good shower but I'm so trying to decide what I want to do I know you actually as my walk-in closet a little bit but I'm still trying to decide what to wear I can't decide what to wear and what I do is I like to pick what to wear first so that I do my makeup and I know like I can go on with my life but I know I can't decide anything let me see what I can think of okay so I decided to not go with this back today but just focus on the bucket had and by the way this bucket hat is from my friend only so ungrateful you guys saw the video anyways this is so far what I have on maybe this top with this bucket hat to play off the pink but I don't know if this is the shirt I'm just trying to show you guys how my brain works when I am getting dressed okay I think you figured it out I think I'm gonna play with the Pink's I decided to wear these baggy pants for target which if they're available only get down below this ungrateful table to go with the green sunglasses you know play off the green and the Pink's so I'm kind of one for like a green pink color palette today that's what we're gonna do now let's go get my makeup ready and continue on with the day all right the outfit has been selected my hair still a mess let's get ready with my makeup I feel like I'm too lazy to do like a whole on cool makeup look cuz I was thinking I'm doing like some sparkly purples and I'll probably do that some other time but for today's rule I think I'm just going to show you guys my lights no makeup makeup look and buy no makeup makeup look the actual no makeup makeup look I'm only gonna put on my skin products well let me concealer under the brows can make it look like a half wake up and that's about it I think so far for what I have planned let's see I am sorry I was talking about the weightless liquid mineral sunscreen from first aid beauty and I actually really really have been enjoying this this one and the Clinique sunscreen just kiss love you both so far I've never really been big on sunscreen because I live in New York and like most of my time I've never been outdoors somewhat a house person so I never really had to worry about sun exposure I actually needed Sun medically if you know you know and that's on depression so high I mean aside from like living in Ecuador when I looked over there for two years I pretty much neglect in my skin and then I came back to New York and I never went out I don't even know what I was talking about let's get into what we're doing alright I'm just gonna apply my face products and the things that I just get two little cotton packing geez and first I'm gonna go into the French Rose a deep hydration facial toner to clean up anything I might have left off behind after washing my face and you guys I know you guys keep having conversations about my piercing because it's infected kind of I'm allergic to cold on my face even though my earrings have always been gold but I think I just developed a cold an allergy or I don't know what's going on but the point is that I need to take it off but this is one of those earrings that or piercings that were was installed by the professional can only be taken off the by the potential cause it's like stuck inside of it and it makes it it needs a specific little plier there's a big little plier to take it off and everything's closed closed a quarantine and I can't take it off because they heal nicely one that had the previous piercing which was not gold it was like with that material like that safety material when they put when you get a piercing whatever it was that's what we had and it heals and I see and then I put on the golden and did not heal now I'm using the fresh black tea facial treatment Aetna's anti-pollution h delay i have noticed my skin has been changing by the way i don't know is it's because I'm getting older or because these parts are actually working but something's happening to my face I don't look bad I think but yeah something's happening to my face and that's on pollution alright next I'm gonna go into the fresh black tea I've been using the from the fresh products for about a month or maybe a little bit over a month I'm juicy I really like them Sephora I love some of them some of them might be fine without I'm trying this one freshly this one recently it's a fresh black th2 the firming serum and it looks really weird I didn't know how to go for the longest I was really just waiting for it to drop and then I figured out that you squeeze this part right here and then you put it in your face you know I'm not the smartest cookie older but I'm definitely not the dumbest anyways I'm playing a little bit everywhere next I'm going to be using my I was actually I switch it up a bit sometimes I use the fresh see very moisturizing facial which I really really enjoy but lately I also have been liking keels is glow formula skin hydrator with pomegranate extract instantly illuminates skin because we have a bit of a tint so when I'm not wearing makeup I go for this one just cuz that's a little bit of a tint and it helps hide the redness with my skin it has this little cat right there at which I need to pop off I heard my nearing accent in that one pop off that looks like that very generously okay so my phone ran out of memory and I had to delete a whole bunch of videos what I did last was at this that's when I got cut off and then I wait for that to dry up a little bit and then I go in with the weightless liquid mineral sunscreen with zinc oxide SPF 30 from first day beauty and I apply it quite generously all over my skin cuz it's almost like it my sunscreen but because it does have a little tinge to it it feels like a little bit foundation so it's almost like I'm treating but I'm not because I'm just protecting my skin and that's what I'll say in court you see it does have a bit of a tint but it looks just like my skin tone like I feel like it blends in quite well to your skin tone it um my girlfriend who is the baddest name she I was gonna say wears it as well and just went into her skin quite well as well so if you're a person of color and you've worn this let me know in the comment section below too so that we can inform everyone else but so far it kind of blends in quite nicely into my skin and it doesn't look weird or anything like that once I'm done blending that all in into my skin cuz it feels like a foundation like I mentioned earlier the last thing I do is I clean on my brows the last thing that I do is I clean out my brows from any product that I might have and kind of brush them into place once that's done I go into my revita brow advance and eyebrow conditioner and I kind of just saturate the entire brow and let that dry and that's pretty much everything I'm doing lately since I don't want to be wearing makeup I know what the Pearson breeze we're trying to let my skin breathe you know this little thing and I'm also trying to empower myself in that way your makeup everything still feeling beautiful last but not least is this heels love oil for lips glow infusing lip treatment which I just dabble over the lips I think my girlfriend's watching you do that you um  well she paints all she goes for paintings little pottery things we got into plants lately well I got into plants lately and now we're painting little pots and I'm gonna show you guys anyways that's it that's pretty much all I do for the skin treatment I let that also get into the skin and then I go and do my hair because I am wearing a bucket hat I can touch me today again you know whatever works for you you know whatever floats your boat all I'm going to do actually is brush my hair and then I just kind of crawl the end so that it looks like I actually did it but no one will ever know that all I did was curl the ends because I'm gonna be wearing a bucket hat which they're alright I don't know about you guys but brushing my hair relaxes me sometimes so when I'm stressed out or just watching TV I like to brush my hair not a lot because I know that's not good for your hair you you can pull it out in damage it but you know here and there which I'm just saying I leave my hairbrush everywhere it's pretty much what I'm trying to tell you so for my little travel one brush it all out I haven't I recently washed it yesterday put it up in a ponytail and this is pretty much just how my hair looks and now all i'm gonna do it is take the curling iron and put it in there coral it there for like 10 seconds 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and there you go my ends are curled and then i move on into big chunks cuz i don't want it to be too perfect you know we're going for that kajal well like i really didn't get ready but I did get ready look when you look for the rest of my hair and I'll be right back the finished kind of curling or lifting a little bit the ends oh it missed a little sparring here a little strand I mean curling it real quickly and then it doesn't really matter it doesn't really have to be perfect even if I'm not wearing a bucket head I will do this and like add a headband and it looks really cute or some barrette and then I just kind of brush it out to like soften it a little bit and I look too to intentional even though it is very intentional now that my skin has soaked up a little bit more of the SPF and it's not too um Gracie I'm gonna go and add a little bit of concealer right under my eyebrows and that helps me fake like I filled in my brows I'll show you the difference literally if you have any brown hair and like you want to just pretend like you fill them out this is all you have to do I swear and it looks so neat and it looks like you spent hours doing your brows but you didn't all you did was I let a little bit concealer bronze it in with the brush and with your finger look at the difference look how clean this looks in comparison to this and that's all I get we do it to the next one you guys and this is how a fake like I do my makeup and I look done but I haven't done really much blend it in with my finger now to make sure that there's some no evidence of a concealer um look that looks so neat if you want to go a little bit of ham you can go on top for that really refined Club that eyebrow and I'm a little bright today so I'm gonna do it and to show you guys blend that in to the skin a little home all right on top of all just following the natural shape of my eyebrows that's all I'm doing and now I'm gonna go ahead and blend it all out with my finger this is a trick that I will show girls who like have full brows and like want to fill them in and I'm like filling them in is literally such a pain in the butt because especially good people like us who don't have brows I'm pretty much all done and that one looks like I sold my brows and I haven't even done anything if I'm feeling a little cocky and I wanna you know embrace the problem even more I'll add a little bit of eyebrow gel and the for my favorite one at the moment is the covergirl easy breezy brow and all I do is I start at the end it's just eyebrow gel just to hold it in place and then a little bit at the front I look and it's still then I go heavy on the end whoopsies that's it it does have like color in it so it fills it up a little bit more without having to go have cleaned up a little mistake that's it that's literally all I do have I just realized that I still had a little bit left over so I'm gonna put it under my eyes so I don't want to waste the product I do this rarely but it's more like I don't want to waste the product so let's just use it type of vibe and of course I'm very lucky to not have to deal with acne and issues like that so this does make it very easier for me and I am I know I am very privileged in that area they're just ready to share what I do this isn't saying like this is what you have to do this is just what I'm doing when I don't want to wear makeup but I want to feel a little bit put together sometimes I do add a translucent powder under here just to hold it like this do you see those barely anything in it just so that it doesn't move like you have so many oils under it that's it that's all I'm doing visually now I'm done with my skin routine now let's get dressed and I'll show you my outfit I mean now I'm gonna get dressed and I'll show you my often and then we can go in there for the day and this is the final look for today as I said I'm going for a comfy like I didn't try I tried a little bit no shoes on the house side you have my Nikes on I won't be putting on sneakers don't know which ones yet we have these little what do you call these sweatpants or cargo pants from Target my crop top from ungrateful my sunglasses from populist Lissy Minh and my bucket hat from ungrateful as well that is cities look okay so I did mention that she was working on some few little pots some little planters she did this cow print like my hand yet Cuba when you do it's not the one I didn't know would you fix it for me yeah oh that's only to go over the white because it's still kind of patchy but that's the one she did she wanted y'all to know that she didn't do that one she was like I did not do that one it's really good okay that one the cow prints the normal top predators I'm very proud and she's little with her a little working a little working woman's I've taken pretty much all day to get ready that is actually lunchtime so I've been craving our awesome way we don't miss Bella like that's literally all I want and throw some ketchup or hot sauce on top chefs kid in the hood I guess I'll show you get so we're gonna do right now what are you just say to me that you know thing it's a good week speak with your chest say with your chest Florida she's from Florida these southerners I have a control I can deal anyways to is just saying that I'm like the little Vietnam and a little girl at the same time why what makes you say that it's Rachel you guys we need to talk about these Cheetos with the cheddar jalapeno Wow just go try them if you have it we're gonna make some rice no Co we run out of rice this is all we have left is like one cup no we have to wash it first  you're supposed to wash the rice Gosselaar nurse right out of control gonna wash your little rice once when I was little the first time I was told to wash rice that wash it with soap oh that could have poisoned anyone please gonna have to throw it away no we walked in for like an hour and we were done away we were you think we were throwing away food and know how close would you throw away clean so you sure love to throw away those dreams all right huh it was an accident all right you got some water I think I'm gonna add my garlic Thanks no well yes I am gonna add my garlic paste that I wanted to also add my garlic salt you should add chopped garlic not garlic paste that's whatever those eggs are using usually I usually try to get like organic eggs I'm like what is it farm raised like free-range eggs but those get expensive so once in a while we like to buy tortured chickens all right I'm a little puree garlic building here cat wrinkle oh you got a paper you strung I got it and I'm quite generous with this actually oh yeah what's that half the bottle a teaspoon  that's done we have a little bit of sad salt but that's not just regular schools no this is the garlic salt it has coarse ground with parsley and that's about it there's an Ecuadorian trick oh there's an Ecuadorian trick that if you put the perfect amount of water onto your rice you can let the spoon will stand up once it's good 100 but wasn't my mom used to do it oh my god anyways I'm gonna taste to see this enough this bolt that's good as you get themself we are not chefs I know you're probably cringing what is she doing going to forget Doug then say tell you you're good and then push it all around hang it around I get so anxious when I'm filming I don't know why I feel like I need to like move fast and it's like now you can edit if you take too long it's really part of my life feel like when you got in the bottom row by the way you set up to my older sister's a piano for getting that for me we'll be right back when food is fun the rice is done now I'm gonna put it any sucked in with some eggs and lunch will be ready have my resin is that thing now I'm gonna add the eggs and now I'm just going to mix it all into the race all right let me do this with the camera because I can't really concentrate and do this but I'll show you once it's done that's pretty much it that's all I've actually been craving is rice and mixed with scrambled eggs I'm never gonna eat this all right I have my little rice and eggs and now I'm adding my red-hot Franchot my red-hot the hot sauce Frank Frank's redhot hot sauce I feel like a little baby that I couldn't do the commercial and I'm gonna enjoy lunch I think right after this probably the next footage is gonna be I was going to go check out the apartment so stay tuned for that hopefully that I've been sitting yeah well every time you come to the bed he starts running around and why does he do this stop rubbing your penis all over my bed sir okay he's so beautiful he's so beautiful I'm searching via thing worthy sneakers with this book I'm getting ready to go we put up Manolos little gate there so that he doesn't go and pee in the living room or anything like that we're getting ready to go just want to put on my sunglasses because I have some packages that weren't delivered and I have to go pick them up now I'm about to put on face mask and we go I've learned to take up other packages I've never been wrong the line but today it's like crazy long all of that Thanks back home I want to show you guys a little bit of my routine I take off my shoes and I put it in this IKEA shoe thing that's like right here in this corner excuse the peepee pad but yeah I actually want to show you guys where I put it so that it's not like lingering at the entrance just open this up Oh sneakers are in there already there we go also I bought this from Target I want to hang it right over here so when guests come over during the winter they want to put off their jacket they can there and now let me open the packages for you guys I don't know if you guys are able to hear me in the US postal office but I got all my packet just one two three four five that were lingering over there and then as I came in there were two more receipts that I wasn't here while they came to drop off some other packages so I might have to go back tomorrow they don't they don't want to come up the stairs because they see 4b so they think that it's for flights but it's technically just three or two actually yeah this is two flights up all right I'm gonna put it in the tripod so you guys can see everything that I'm going to unbox right now if you give me the little knife I mean the little scissors or any scissors they don't have to be all right pretty god we have a box right here I'm gonna pull it out of our little tote bag so New York has an implementer that there's no more plastic bags and you go when you go grocery shopping so I have made sure to keep my tote bags around and they look really handy and then accidie and actually feels a lot more chic ER to walk around with a tote bag than a plastic bag so I'm sticking to that here's the first package I have been doing a lot of shopping on Instagram for my apartment because they've been trying to buy from ng designers and also buying my vintage stuff to like help with the system the ecosystem the world and not create more pollution oh here is one of the things let me pull it out that I bought oh okay so I saw this online and it's from this Instagram brand right here I forgot the name but I'll put a brick end up in the page so you guys can see it it's a girl from Georgia and she's selling a lot of pieces and I saw this vase Oh boss it sounds very same day I like saying boss what do you guys like thing and I saw this gorgeous lots and I was like I asked her can you tell me the measurement and then I said actually never mind just send it to me here's my money take my money and she did she took my money and she sent over the product nothing crazy about Instagram and like shopping on Instagram is that I've noticed that I literally am to shopping from photos and like from strangers and just been mowing and then money and being like hey send me this and what if it's like a scam if you can but it could be a bunch of joints and I don't even know many I'm so excited to show you guys this babe so I think it's beautiful oh my god it's a lot bigger than I thought it was gonna be but I still love it look at this gorgeous little closet I feel like it fits perfectly in my apartment with my theme what do you guys think check her out you guys she solved a lot of beautiful things there's this lucite cowboy hat that I've been fighting to get no oh this is it I put some nice little flowers have some nice little plants in here and that's the first thing scuri this one I think is also from one of the people that I've bought okay so this is a girl whose Instagram name is clay tip I'm obsessed with her I found her like a few months ago if you guys follow me on instagram you know that I'm constantly posting her little pots and planters because they're so pretty and cute they're shaped like boobs and she was having this like last-minute sale on her Instagram stories and I DM her and I was like send me all four of the planters on you're selling please and she thought I was joking and I really had to fight with her so that she would let me buy it and she let me buy it it was really funny actually that day I was like can you like let me buy thank you cuz I think she thought I was joking and just being like I was so cute I want all of them and she was like thank you and I'm like no I'm serious give me all of them and I bought all of them well only two three because they were spore and one of them had already sold out before I could even like my chance to it I don't even know what size it is like this might be a little too small for the class that I have at home but it's so beautiful oh my god it's so cute with little sagging tips and then the bottom it says clay chips I definitely recommend her planters are very very beautiful they don't have holes in the bottoms which I thought was going to be a problem from when I am at watering my plants but she said that the material in the bottom or of the planter ceramic is what the cult for porous and I guess that means that it consumes the water it helps of storage so that the plant isn't dying and you know doesn't drown here's one of them I bought the other two oh this one looks a little bit bigger so I'm very excited about this place I might putting my favorite client in this one this looks much bigger let me show you the sizes which is rounder and smaller so good I'm definitely going for like a body theme in my apartment so that what we're doing this is the last one I did enjoy this like I always makes me wonder this is a vibe randomly oh it's soo the same I thought it was I guess online it looked like it was two different skin tones but it's all the same I think I'm gonna put these together that would be nice anyway that's the second box that I have here on to the third oh okay this is another Instagram person who hath like you know just like the other girls are selling their stuff on Instagram and this girl sells vintage stuff and if I'm not mistaking this is a vintage back from the 30s or 40s that I bought for quite cheap I think and I think I only paid $30 red and I think this is the one it is it is a bad so there's this from pit-hole another Instagram found that I love to portraits from that isn't my first purchase but I've been looking at it for a while and send me a little cars I think you stay safe and healthy xoxo PIP home here is the bad wow she's beautiful so you didn't tell that she's a little rusty on top the metal looks a little old but obvious because it's from the 1930s or 40s I want to open it and make sure that not much fits here and that's fine with me I'm known to be wearing a lot of small back so I always make it work probably just my little flat wallet my phone a lipstick lotion and my teeth will fit there I'll make all of that finding it oh my god I'm so excited to make an outfit with this one alright next is from the demon stuff basis and I'm one of his helpers apparently cuz IQ by feeling okay so I don't really have curtains on my windows and I bought these really few ones from Amazon it's from like a small seller so at least that doesn't make me feel that bad less when I least is the biggest bag the biggest box I should say my back I think this one oh there's a quite few things in this box that's really pretty big so I saw on tick-tock this girl I was doing her hair with this Revlon hair dryer and volumizer and the way I love to have my hair is like this and the only way I can actually style my hair like that is when I blow dry it and curl the ends but I feel like the girl got her hair the way I like it with just using this product because I might use it tomorrow and show you guys I'm excited I'm gonna wash my hair again tonight or tomorrow morning just so that I can do it next thing in the box oh okay so since I have a lot of plants now I bought this little tin water thingy and it was supposed to be gold but it's not gold I don't care it's not I'm not gonna be that picky this one went yeah by the way I've been doing still good during quarantine not buying stuff and the past week or two I actually broke and bought a lot of stuff as you guys can see and there's more than coming so thanks oh and then this is a little table lamp that I bought for the little table that goes over there right next to my couch it's yours I look look that's good as it does online if not I'm gonna return that that's Jeff Bezos doesn't any more money that's a thing just right we were talking about that the other day and how he's gonna be a trillionaire the first trillionaire in the world and how insanely disgusting that is because you have so much money you're not helping others that's what's sad I don't I have no problem people being filthy rich as long as you're helping other people at the same time pull it out  you've been by my side so here's the lightbulb area let me show you so this is what it's supposed to look like I'm gonna show you right here on the screen here's the lightbulb part let me not take it out of the bag with my greasy Han you think it's so weird okay this is the light bulb the tough part where we put the light or the light would kind of look a little bit vintage brassy type of thing it looks quite similar to what it looks behind the site I thought it had like you use ridges I thought they were actually texturized but they're not you put the libel up on top I think it's cute I not mad at it really like it that's pretty much that's pretty much all the packages that I have to go pick up at the USPS because they won't come upstairs because who knows I don't even know anymore but I have people pick up the packages now that's everything I'm gonna try and like fix it around the apartment and if I do I'll show you but if not the next clip will be of me and doing something else or at the apartment toy we're finally in the car and we're on our way to Brooklyn to go see this apartment which oh by the way we do have our math we just take it out take it off while in the car okay so around the way to the apartment it's an apartment a two-bedroom apartment apartment in Brooklyn and the rent goes for about 2,100 I believe and yeah so we're gonna go check it out and hopefully things go well hopefully it's nice and spacious and it all works out but I'll bring you guys some one so you guys can see the apartment hopefully I'm allowed to record and not all try to be sneaky anyways I don't miss this part of like finding an apartment like apartment hunting for me it was a complete nightmare I was apartment hunting for six months back in the day when I started apartment hunting I literally had really bad credit score so it was really hard for me to get an apartment and yeah it was just a nightmare and everything was so expensive living in New York is literally wrenches the worst part one of the worst parts and it's a joke it's really a freaking joke okay but this neighborhood is so charming in these trees wow this is so nice the apartment was super nice it was nice and spacious but it was what's a called Royale it a real you have real room it's a railroad type of apartment which pretty much means that it's just long real corner to something like that but they transformed the was it the living room into like another room or they transform that die what would have traditionally been a dining room into like another room right exactly so when you walk in the first thing you see is the living room and then you see the kitchen and the area Halleck a nice little TV in a nice little window right in front of the couch and then as you go in deeper there's the kitchen and right after the kitchen is this really nice clean white bathroom but the best part about that area is that you can go outside the window from the bathroom and there's a little what would you call that a little look area outside of the window or it was actually the fire escape it's a fire skippity she turned it into like a little terrace with like a tiny table and it's I need you exactly thank you so it was really nice and I thought it was a really cute little moment and then on the upper side from when you come in that there is this dark room which she was saying was another bedroom and there would be no privacy between that bedroom and the bedroom that's right behind it which is the actual bedrooms you have to pass but you would have to walk through it quote-unquote bedroom to get to the next exactly so once you got in that area she had like a little song a moment there which I thought was funny and then inside the bedroom there's what she had her bed however to the bed on the side of the bed on the left side of the bed when you walk in there's actually another entrance to your apartment but she had that blocked with a little coffee table I wasn't in love with the way it was set up but I think that with the new people coming in they can have a great a grave or have fun time setting up for that apartment like you can get really creative at that place it's a great thanks for just like a couple or a single person would be great but da for someone who owns roommates because then your room and you're gonna be in your bedroom like I said cuz it goes you have to go to one bedroom to then go to the second one so there's literally a huge like a privacy and that apartment was retailing for $2,100 so yeah that's a little moment in New York of shopping I mean of apartment hunting so yeah on the way there look at this place you guys it's really freaking creepy and cool as hell I don't know I think someone this their yeah the light is on and they have like nice decorations and stuff they have like the haunted keep out keep out it's crazy and it goes connect it's the way never been by this area of Brooklyn I'm a Bronx girl so I never come to Brooklyn this is Greenpoint and the neighborhood is actually really really pretty and peaceful the goodies apartment look at this one oh look at this wooden one anyways it's nice to see where the rich people live it's it's really a beautiful place it's so quiet I just see elderly people and like parents a few of young people there like other we saw another lesbian couple house-hunting and we decided to go get some food to pick up because we won't have time to make dinner and we're trying to be as quick as possible because it left Manolo and he I don't leave him for more than two or three hours by himself so I'm gonna pick up some brisket and off we go also I just want to show you this neighborhood this neighborhood is nice you little building 3d walls over there oh there's too many people on industry we've gotten some brisket for Mabel's right here behind me I've never had food from their place so I'm excited to get and try it out so we have the food here the brisket the potato salad and some mac and cheese a just a little dry the first time that ever had brisket and barbecue was in Texas and was yeah but with Austin Austin Texas and it was really good so I was hoping it was gonna be like that too too good to be true but I'm gonna taste good it's a little dry though I'm gonna enjoy this and then I'm gonna fix the apartment clean up a bit and I'll show you guys where I put things get put boxes inside boxes see um we started watching mr. cape and I'm gonna wash some dishes clean up my girlfriend's gonna put up the new curtains up and hopefully it looks better I'm not gonna show you me washing dishes because I'm gonna be real quick cuz I really want to get into cleaning and we're gonna enter the apartment a little bit a little bit more that's a little kind of what it looks like you guys still not the way I wanted to look but it's not bad so I got some really clear shared currency because my apartment has such great lighting that I still wanted it to stay true to that while I was watching this just my girlfriend was installing the curtains putting them up and her extra Aquarius ass um started steaming the curtains which is like an extra detail that is making a difference truly honestly okay so I've arranged around I've added the curtains our sister my girlfriend I have the curtains I've played a little bit around with this little space that's the light fixture that I showed you the little mint that I got this area is a hot mess I know I still don't know how to organize it I don't know what plants to put I need help it's way too flat I do like my little boobs over here I think they're really nice and cool we have a little fern them there clearly we need taller plants here this this long wide ones gonna go hanging over here this is pretty much a rough edit of what's going on in my apartment clearly it's not ready here's some black calla lilies that I love their gorgeous my girlfriend picked aside at Home Depot I still need art here clearly but that's what we have going on right now and it's a little organized but we still have a lot of work to do I just got out of the shower for going to bed and like a shower in the morning and at night sometimes because you know especially there would be it's warmer it's a little too hot and then it gets like I got to stay keen gross anyways I just wanted to before going and logging out I just wanted to share with you guys my quick I'm too sleepy I'm too tired to do much to my skin and all they do is at the origins drink up intensive cream and literally it's my favorite because it smells so good and I add quite generously mostly I start on the side of the cheeks where it's really really ride there's rosacea and dry patches which helps the next day makes my skin feel really really good and then whatever's left over I kind of push into the center of the face which is a part of my skin which is like more natural and less dry do the same on this side very generously because I end up rubbing a lot of it off when I'm sleeping so just around the face mill sees where I like to go hard on or go ham I should say and then now add the rest to the center of the face make sure that it's all blended out a little left over add a little bit of elbow elbows that never hurts and that's literally like my quickly go to bed routine alright I hope you guys enjoyed today's vlog
