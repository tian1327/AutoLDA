 once having sleep but I'm woke good morning so I'm shook these actually look freaking great like I pushed my cuticles back I did a buffing and like the useful these will do honestly six dollars a box there's some nails left my first response I decided to start the day by making some breakfast I wanted to vlog it because this is literally the most delicious just add water pancakes you have to get the Hungry Jack brand specifically I tried it with the other dress odd waters and it didn't taste the same but add some cinnamon and it's so good I am on my way to Costco it's kind of fun because I can kind of take some video of what it's like in Costco right now in quarantine so that people can see what it's like around the world I'm on Oh sounds probably already done that but I'll show you what my casa looks like to get diapers ever already went through his whole box of diapers that I got him Ella still has hers I'm actually gonna move ever it up to a size three cuz he just popping out of the size twos so I'm driving I know I need to get like a mount for a phone when I Drive but yeah last night was relaxing to an extent I ended up putting Everett back in his old swaddle he just sleeps better and I don't know what to say like the Halos got it down the new brand that I'd showed you in my previous video did not work like he was waking up all night long it was not it wasn't holding anything in and he's not fully swaddled I get it but like that one just was not meant to be for Everett so I'll take you with me at Costco I'm just getting diapers and I think it takes but still I also want to reiterate again thank you for taking the time to watch my videos I really want to get really into blogging and like the approver I just love doing it and I will do it even if nobody's watching so that's the best part   so about to go inside I have my mask on I'm gonna grab Everett who is very tired and fussy right now and of course every time I come to Costco it's raining the list was pretty extensive of things that they were out of stock on luckily everything I came for was in stock this time last time I came they were fully out of baby wipes cuz people hoarded them because we were out of toilet paper nothing like a social distancing bathroom  overall my experience at Costco was smooth like it literally took us three minutes to get inside the door despite the line on the bottom and it took me literally like 10 minutes to grab everything everybody was distant socially everybody was actually kind of awkward because nobody wanted to get in anyone's way so people were actually being faster than they usually are in Costco they're just taking their time reading every label and they get you right out the door so good times thank you for watching and don't forget to subscribe
