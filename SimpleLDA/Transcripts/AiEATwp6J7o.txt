that I'm gonna be wearing today this is the Nike tech pack jacket and it is in a army green color I actually acquired this about a year ago and I just never got around to wearing it as you guys can see still have the tags on it so I will be popping some tags today first things first got to hit the post office and drop these it is off rolling with the Rowdies one time though yeah man it's a good thing that this post office is right by the crib that's the only place that I've been going to is the post office ever since this quarantine started just to drop off some packages pretty much if I'm not in the house I went to the post office real quick that's about it quick essential before I head into this UPS Store to drop off these packages got to throw the mask on slight flex with the bait but it is essential and I know a lot of people are probably thinking yo why you got a mask on and the coronavirus isn't even airborne that's true but you're trying to touching something and I've touched my face or anything I can't go down like that so that's why I wear the mask and I also keep that thing when we got to keep the hand sanitizer on big yo shout-out to UPS and USPS man they've been getting me in and out of there as fast as they can in the past couple of days but now we got one more stop man we gotta go put in some gas because lord knows I ain't left the house in BO days man so let's go ahead and drop some gas in the tank and these gas prices at all the time oh well here in Las Vegas so 35 a gallon it's only gonna cost about $30 a service pay go and jump a life on this video for the gas prices dropping like hotcakes on a Sunday oh no not even $30 I will take them hey alright man we all filled up about to go scoop up the homies real quick man then we head into the strip y'all let's get it I'm in the Chinatown area right now in Las Vegas and this place is deserted man if you've ever been to this Chinatown out here in Las Vegas you'll know that this place is always packed man it's crazy to see it like this yo scooping up the homies right now wasn't it bro this place is deserted man sign to town I can be doughnuts in the parking lot right now this is crazy I've never seen the strip so empty literally I am Dean literally because you can't park anywhere on the strip so we have to improvise we have to go to a mall pulled up on the mall man now we got to walk to the street from here so so right now we're walking by the Fashion Show Mall and there's literally not a soul other than us over here nobody one of the same it's a couple cars driving past the street but that's about it I mean other than that literally you might see two or three people walking down the strip all the escalators are closed by the way we have to walk upstairs everything  so we just got word that you can only walk the strip sides pretty much all of the Front's of the casinos are blocked off by barricades and they do have cops that pretty much every single one of them or security if it's not a cop it's a security and pretty much just a strip side that's that's all you can walk on is the strip side you can go up and down the bridges but I mean that's about it just to get across the street I guess  this is honestly a crazy time to be living in Las Vegas or even be walking to stick literally I mean I'm kind of mind blown at the fact that there's nobody out here it's just us and a couple other people walking or getting a workout in but it is really crazy to see that there's nobody walking on this street   so we applied see this palace right now and I'm really curious to see if the waterfront is still not kept up if they still clean it out if it's drained so we're about to walk up to that very soon literally nobody here man this is like the perfect photo op for anybody that ever wanted to take pictures out here in Las Vegas man yo this is insane man they drained the waterfront at the Caesars look at this man that is wild I don't think I've ever seen it look like this that's amazing now I'm actually curious to see if they did the same thing with the Bellagio man that would be so crazy to see just this big lake that they have in front of the building just being empty oh my goodness well there's so much water look what it has the meter walking across the bridge right now to the Bellagio and this thing is boarded off yeah this is pretty crazy man I wonder if all of the front of the casinos are boarded off like this so the Bellagio water is still here still full I was kind of hoping that they would have drained it probably would have been really cool to see that I have to drop the masks for a little bit man I need to breathe but I hope you guys are enjoying this content and if you are go ahead and drop a like for you boy I am out here risking my life to bring you guys this content so go ahead and do that for me one time still got to get the photo shoots in and in front of the Miracle Mile shops and this is in front of the Paris my guy out
