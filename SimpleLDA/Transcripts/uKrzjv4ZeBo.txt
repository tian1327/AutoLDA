 like savory tubes where long very long so we're leaving the apartment to go to Costco I actually don't remember the last time I've been outside and so this'll be nice I figured today we could go out since the next three days are gonna be raining here we go  so a lot of businesses in our neighborhood are actually closed the only things that are open are the bodegas and the supermarkets which we're grateful for but in times like this when we have to go to Costco there's just some things that we can't get there which is what I wear out right now   time is it it's like almost noon  for your social distancing marker or to look at  reinforcements this is our reinforcements  so apparently they're only letting five to ten people in at the store at a time but the way he's moving so it's promising think we only waited like five minutes   no shortage of bread we stocked on Brad  so I couldn't get much in there started getting yelled at because I was filming but we made it we made it out got all the essentials and no trip to Cusco is complete without haha in the soda lose our lunch today  we also wanted to bring our under roommate out with us to the park as you can see he loves walking so took us a while to get to the park  there's no shortage of people  I put on makeup duties specifically just for this video target was pretty stocked but there was not a lot of shoppers you could clearly see that people were steering clear of each other but they closed the Starbucks I think that the panic buying is probably over in New York City because it seems as though with the limits that the stores have put on what people can buy and the actual amount of people going in not a lot of people are walking out with carts toilet paper or paper towels or water because they weren't clearly stocked in the store I saw a bus passing by with no passengers so that's good I feel like a lot of people are staying home but it was raining yesterday so when we went out to the park there was a lot of people just a lot of people going on walks they were kind of keeping their distance to each other but there was just so many people that when they were all running they were all pretty much like running next to each other so freak me out a little bit anyway I just wanted to make this video because I have so many friends and family that keep texting me asking me how we are in New York City in Brooklyn we live in Brooklyn to be specific and yeah we're okay I think we're surviving I think that a lot of that has to do with us really staying indoors like we've only gone out if we really need to the only time that we've ever gone out is to go for like tops an hour out to just walk in the park keeping six feet apart so many people and to go to the grocery store so those are the only two times that we've ever really gone out and it hasn't been for more than an hour two at a time so let me know in the comments down below if you like these videos so that I keep doing them or I just won't keep doing them and we'll see you soon this is Jenna signing out  hi are you fully asleep Louie likes to sleep with his eyes open and think he's falling asleep right now
