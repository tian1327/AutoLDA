  this is the camcorder that I told you guys about that broke the other day or supposed to be broke but somehow it works again it works again I mean because I got it working again so I'm gonna be using this camcorder a guy that would be I got it working like like a few weeks ago but I'm using it again well anyway so I'm gonna use this camcorder to record my next video right now Chuck challenge look at this backyard now look at the crash starting to grow that grew trees are starting to grow leaves so this blooming now oh hi youtubers this is Gil so today it's um I believe April 11th 2020 or is it the 12th well I'm gonna check so yeah okay yeah Levens April and I just uploaded these two videos and I'm uploading another one right now from 1993 these two I just uploaded right now I know you guys are probably watching it right now so right now this is morning so nah I'm telling you so how's this pandemic going for you guys well I do know that I mean I mean I'm taking it okay I mean like I guess but you know they're not really like out there enforcing Gary buddy but I'm hearing about the mask law now or that were supposed to wear masks out in the public you know right now in my backyard trust nobody that saying if you have I don't know if they're really actually for air they are but I mean it's not like something that gonna run after you for not wearing you know but anyway so some things that it kind of observed about this coronavirus thing of that it's like it's certain people that that are that are high-risk and from what I've seen in the last four month or all the things that I saw like people doctors or research I like I googled it and everything and based on all those googling and everything that I study seems like the number one people at risk or have Akali who have the biggest risk is is gonna be people with underlying health conditions are obese people that's what I hear a lot about I mean those are those I mean most of the underlying health condition is probably like number one risk that's what I'm hearing a lot you know so and then I'm here and also about people like who who are otherwise healthy and but suddenly died from this thing like young and healthy but suddenly died any puzzles me there I mean and it gets me all scared about that makes me wonder okay why why is this why is this happening to some people and I think I'm hearing about that their their bodies had an overreaction or some body have an overreaction or some people body people's bodies have them have an overreaction to the truth I would call a day colleague kiddo a shadow dying storm or something I don't know in that shot to pronounce you but I know it's something like that like where are the body overreacts with the weight it's what certain people I guess the only certain people with certain genetics or some that's what I heard anyway so that's where this thing about people suddenly dying like otherwise healthy and no underlying conditions or anything you know it's all it's a certain genes or some that I mean that's something like that anyway now I would like to talk about like what would it be like what will was like in the 80s decade or 90-second well like how would we how would we have handled the pandemic a pandemic like this in the eighties decade well you think about it imagine you know like if I was living in the eighties decade like those videos that I just uploaded I mean where we had a VCR and we had just a TV no internet no cable TV while they had cable TV but we didn't have cable TV back then we just had a regular TV the free channels you know we had our Atari and then and then we had our landline so you figured like if we had a pandemic like instead of 2020 yeah but it was in 1980 a if we had a pandemic in 1988 how would we handle they how would we have handled a well we would hear everything through the TV basically and everything on TV is like we would go by what the TV says about the lockdown on what we have to do on making sure that we cannot go outside or stay in our home you would hear it all on the TV so I mean but how do we handle a stay at home in the eighties and nineties decade well I'll just talk about 80 well I mean figure in the eighties decade if we had a we were declared a pandemic in 1988 for an example I would probably think you know what I was like how we would handle a stay-at-home quarantine how would we handle that well that thinks we would just be watching the only thing that we would have to do watch TV and be CRV and if we had any pre-recorded videotapes of movies or something then we could then we could watch our pre-recorded VHS article just stick to the TV and maybe record off the TV and stuff Oracle's like just hear the radio music music and radio and record songs off the radio and replay them over and over and then also like what else well then we would have the landlines you know like we would be able to call friends if we were not able to if we were not allowed to get out of our house and visit friends then the landlines is the only thing that we got to talk to our friends with or we could probably just walk to the neighbor's house or something then we would just have a little party there whatever but now but in today's times since a pandemic is on 20/20 like look what we have to entertain as it's all about tablets and computers and Internet I tell you is all great thanks to the internet that we have today and all the things that we have today I mean it's not too bad but I mean I know for some of you it's pretty bad I mean some of you like some people want to be outside which is like the 80s style you know like but but since we're stuck in a house there were we have all the technology we got the Netflix and we got Amazon Prime and and we can go to ebay buy stuff and wait for the mails since we cannot go to stores and stuff but a variety of thousand the 80s and we could not go to a like a Circuit City or some then we would be kind of stuck to just grocery stores I like we're stuck with grocery stores but if you want to diet but you want to shop somewhere else the only thing in today's time in 2020 and since the pandemic is on 2020 with the technology that we have if we wanted to buy something in today in today's time I don't think a lot a lot of these and non-essential star to open now but if we need if we wanted to buy something like non-essential we could go on eBay and get it I mean but a built in the 80s and they closed all that non in central stores in the eighties it'd be kind of hard to live life because we would only we would have to be dependent on the things that we have right now humming whatever that we have that's all you have or maybe have a neighbor had something for sale with Danny we could buy from them or whatever but anyway anyway enough of that for that protects time rings this is me so yeah it's finally sunny after like a few days of rain you know my garage so I I've been working some out I've never really been working a lot of hours but now ours is not too much detail but I'm just happy I'm just happy that my job is not affected by this some pandemic but I mean I feel for you guys whose jobs been affected by bombing sick for me by even for me I cannot I cannot even guarantee that my job is gonna go through with this though and then I wonder I still wonder how long this pandemic is gonna last but some people think it's gonna last more than a year but Bill Gates you know the prediction on the pandemic going back to nor ever ething going back to normal by at the end of 2021 but we're talking about that that doesn't mean the pandemic is an ant in 2021 the Panda me go and probably like this year's some time but it gonna take it's gonna take at least until 21 to recover or for everything to go back to normal you know in terms of like if the virus never came along you know but okay like even if the pandemic is gonna finish I mean it's not gonna go back to normal right away now right away you're not gonna do that right away I mean because all that all the businesses have that close you know like people the money that people were not making because of not working it's gonna take a while before they get back to where they were and then all the bill that they were behind or whatever have to catch up or all of you guys yeah I feel for you guys you know yeah but you know if anything's gonna happen to me like as far as job wise haha I'm not gonna even bother I'm nothing you don't worry about it I'm really gonna throw it at the Lord and I'm I'm supposed to cast a cart cares to the Lord you know have anything happens here I'll just cast my cares to the Lord you know I mean I'm ready for anything and I mean what can they week what can we do you know like anything bad to happen from what can we do it has all of them as honest as long as I think bad thing didn't happen because of my irresponsibility or I think that I'm okay I mean what can I do what can I do like if something bad happens but it's not because of Maya carelessness or anything then what can I do you know but I'll regret it if something bad happens to me because of being careless or irresponsible or something for an example like I'm gonna kick my own ass kick my own ass if something bad happens with the job because I decide to quit for an example you know well anyway well anyway well speaking of jobs like my job you know like people like people complain like alright every job people complain about but some people feel like they complain about the pay or something that they feel like they're being underpaid in that job but for me I don't care man I don't care I mean I'm just happy I'm working for now I mean whatever I mean I don't care man at least not right now anyway go ahead even right now no more now right now I mean I didn't even care for the cheese's at the star about right now I'm driving these on pallet jacks electric pallet jack and I know that I'll eventually get on to the next a level like the forklift and the high reach and stuff I know I'll get there eventually but but there's always been known that those jobs pay more money then then the normal labor worker like the loading of the trucks people always tell me that it's more money to drive a pallet jack or a forklift and stuff and yeah I would say yeah but I mean if they're not gonna give me a raise I mean I'm just gonna I don't care at the moment you know I'm just having fun driving though something pallet jacks and I just like how that's a job it's easy you know so yeah I mean it's an easy job and it's fun it's actually fun to drive those things you know well anyway so this is my blog or B log I don't know what's gonna happen with my birthday you know I'm wondering about my birthday and unfortunately I don't think this pandemic I don't think anything's gonna go back to normal sadly by my birthday than August 12th I'll be 50 years old pretty quick you know tell you but I mean this is this April this is April 11th 2020 so it's four months away before my birthday and I don't think anything's gonna go back to an art think it's gonna go back to normal fire my birthday oh well I mean what can I say but I think it should probably I would its imaginable that will be less restrictions you know I mean well I think they saying that I mean they they don't want to lift their restrictions up too early speaker that can cause trouble because they can it can go back coming like the coronavirus can strike back again if they let it up too early they can cause trouble so I mean what they I think I'm hearing that they're doing is that they want to ease it off little by little that restrictions like lack of their might for example I'm thinking that they're gonna open the dine in so later on like in the next couple months but they're gonna be restrictive on their like where are they're only gonna let up certain amount and they might reopen like the non-essentials I'm dead that's just my gas though like in the next few model be required to wear a mask or something you know like they are right now so join anyways so it's my blog for the day it's alright well so you guys enjoyed this video so alright and yeah okay
