  hey guys welcome back to my youtube channel I decided to film another fun week in the life during quarantine just when you guys along with me through my day today and through everything I'm up to I hope you guys enjoyed last week's video it was my first ever week in the life and I had a lot of fun working on it today I am just working behind my computer right now I'm wearing it this fun green dress it's from ASOS and it's really loose fitting and comfortable so it's kind of my working from home dress I wear it all the time it's long and flowy I'll show you a video of it but you know let's just put them up to answering some emails doing some work for making it at Manhattan and I am doing a fun of virtual podcast recording tonight so I'll show you guys some of that but a side note my nails are struggling it's so hard right now as some of you guys might know my nails are real so these long nails that I have they are my real nails so not being able to go to the salon has been really a struggle I know first real problem sorry but so I just ordered to powder dip kits but I don't know when they're gonna be here it said like 7 to 10 days so I'm really struggling the gel is like as you can see grown all the way out and my nails are starting to bend so it's actually pretty painful so wish me luck I have another video that I did a couple months ago about my nails and how I keep them long and my nail care routine so I'll link that below if you're interested in nail growth or in keeping your nails long and strong but now I gonna go get ready and shoot something I had a phone call this morning for working then I have another phone call at 3 o'clock and then I have the virtual podcast tonight so stay tuned I'll be bringing you along for all the fun so now I'm just getting ready for another at-home photo shoot I've actually been feeling a little bit uninspired and discouraged the past two weeks I think just because I've been feeling like I shot in all the cool spaces in my house and I've been trying to stay inspired and make the most out of my space and you know use different angles or different corners or things like that but it's been difficult so I'm really doing my best to stay inspired and to try and keep things fun and fresh and different especially when I've been inside at the same four walls for three months maybe it's a crazy egg I'm losing track but I'm excited about today's outfit I already picked out my look that I'm shooting I kind of have my hair hair and makeup done already but yeah I'm gonna talk to you through my outfit no because sometimes they get us about kind of like my process and how I pick out my outfit stuff let's do it okay so I'm really excited about today's look I got this Nike sequined sweatshirt forever ago and I have never worn it so I was going through my closet today and I and I was like you know what I feel like it's kind of a cool working from home look especially since I don't really shoot and sweat a lot but I'm obviously gonna dress it up and so I'm pairing it with this fun sequin Cynthia rally skirt and I just think it's like a cool contrast to the sweatshirt and then of course for shoes I was kind of torn between doing sneakers or doing regular shoes so I might shoot both but these shoes are from this brand it's called Corral and they did a collab with this other brand called syrettes that I actually wear a lot and that's really really fun and so these shoes yes they look a little bit beat up because I wear them a lot but I love it because they say magic shoes on them so yeah so look it says magic mmm says shoes so when you wear them they say magic shoes and I just think that they're so fun and I'm thinking that I might style them with like a sock so I think it'll make for like a cool working from home vibe look and it all started by when I found the sweatshirt that's how I started this look I was inspired I saw the sweatshirt and then I at first wanted to pair it with a gold bottom because of the gold but then I saw this and I felt like it worked and then of course the gold shoes to tie it all together so I'm just gonna throw on some lipstick change and then get started so I just finished shooting this was the final look I did add socks and I rolled up the sweatshirt when I was shooting it so you can head on over to my Instagram if you want to see the final shots I'm now just gonna eat some lunch edit some tic TOCs and then get ready for my virtual as later at 6 p.m. so I just finished the virtual recording for girl gays podcast with Paige Taylor and Margo and it was so much fun honestly nights like these when I could just chat with some of my friends even though it's virtual is so much fun so it can't wait for the podcast to come out should be coming out this Sunday so now Dave and I are just heading to Target to pick up some essentials we need my hair is tucked into my sweater no I did not cut my hair it looks looks a little short but I did not and I'm just wearing this one Nike sweatshirt that I actually shot today yeah casual but cute so we just got back from grocery shopping we ended up not going to target because the line was crazy long it was like around the block so we ended up going to Costco and said just got a few different things I ended up actually getting flowers for the shoot I'm doing tomorrow and now we're probably just gonna make something for dinner and watch a movie or something hey guys so I just woke up about an hour ago I have actually been downstairs for the past hour cleaning my couch because Dave always wakes up before me every morning and he wakes up and he feeds the cat and not too long after he ran into the room to wake me up because my kitten fits ate too fast and threw up all over the couch so I have been downstairs just cleaning the couch trying to get the stain out / make sure it didn't stain so luckily it seems like it's not staining but I was really worried also I was worried about him because I was like is he feeling okay and things like that but he gets very excited in the morning when he eats so I think you just say too quick and got sick so Eddie that's where I've been and now I have a consulting call with one of my clients that I do consulting for in about 30 minutes so for the next 30 minutes leading up to it I'm just gonna go sit behind my computer and check emails and kind of like start my day I'll see you later so I just finished my consulting call with one of my clients and now I am gonna be shooting something special I got this package from Alison melibea so I'm going to do a little bit of an unboxing for you guys and then I'm gonna shoot the look and I'm really excited so this is the full look how gorgeous is this I'm actually helping Alison Olivia promote their sample sale that's going on this week so they sent me this fun look to wear to shoot and it's so gorgeous I love it so much I think I'm gonna shoot it outside in my front yard so let's see how that

a makeup artist or the best at makeup but that's why I was he pretty simple also I get sent a lot of different products so I'm always changing what I use but the basis of what I do is pretty much always the same and then I'll pretty much rotate through different foundations and blushes and highlighters and things like that so first things first I'm gonna start with foundation and lately I've been going between two different foundations I have this one from Laura Mercier and it's called the flawless Lumiere radiance perfecting foundation and then I have the Revlon photo candid foundation which I've also been using so I've been rotating between these two and they're really good they get the job done I like them a lot I'm usually like a medium or a medium tan skin tone depending on the time of year and depending on you know summer and all that fun stuff so I'm just starting out I'm taking my foundation just kind of pretty much put it in different spots around my face just like that nothing too crazy turn to cover all my bases and then I just use a beauty blender I really need a new one actually I've had this one a pretty long time but then I just use a Beauty Blender and I just
