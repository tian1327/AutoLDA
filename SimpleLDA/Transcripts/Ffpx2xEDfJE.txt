 here's some awkward b-roll that I made someone else take for me how to get them greens cuz you know your girl has been looking a little extra fluffy since coroutine has started not even gonna lie what is up you guys it's Vicky today we are back with another video we are actually going grocery shopping don't obviously grocery shopping looks really different now than it did previously so I just thought that I would show you the process of how I do it first of all in order to minimize the amount of time that I'm outside I always make a grocery list and lists out all the things that I definitely need to buy so that once I'm in the grocery store I can grab all these items and head out as soon as possible and to minimize like you know the things that I'm touching I also don't bring like a purse I have like a nice fanny pack situation going on but in the fanny pack we've got mask gloves our wallet and my phone obviously and yeah I'm just gonna take you guys along and show you what we're getting today so let's go we are on the way to the grocery store so I would highly recommend going grocery shopping during the weekdays on Monday to Friday whether it's after work or if you have a day off during the weekday because on the weekend there are just so many people so obviously right now it is not great to bring reusable bags because you're introducing new germs and things like that and so whether you are deciding to purchase bags at the store or to like leave the items in your cart and put them in your car it's totally up to you but just make sure you're not bringing reusable bags and then other than that obviously the CDC is now recommending that everybody wears a mask when you're outside if you don't have a mask available make sure that you're using a piece covering you know cloth based covering whether that means a hankerchief or scarf normally I'm the kind of person who likes to gross grocery shopping like every two to three days you know just get like fresh produce and you know snacks need a refresher on the snacks but obviously with coronavirus you want to make sure that you are minimizing the number of times that you're having to go out and practice you know good social distancing physical distancing you can also just order your groceries via instant car or some sort of delivery service if you don't want to go out as well so about to leave the car but before I open this door it's really important to put on your mask this is a mask that i've been reusing for a little bit obviously we're not going out really often and so after i use the mask i just leave it in the car for it to disinfect itself over the course of the next couple weeks until i use it again so let's do this thing make sure that the mast is covering both your nose in your mouth oh my gosh it drives me insane when i'm going outside and i'm seeing people with masks on and it's like you know like this like that is not going to protect you but once it's on you want to make sure that you're not adjusting your masks when you're outside because that means that you're introducing your dirty hands with germs to right directly towards your airway and if it helps for you to put your hair up or whatever do what's best for you the other thing important to know is that your phone you want to make sure that you're not cross contaminating so if you are using gloves that's totally fine but make sure you're not using the gloves touching groceries and then going ahead and then you know texting someone then all those germs are then now transferred to your phone and so that defeats the purpose of using glove hello welcome to Mickey's voiceover I feel like it's been quite a little bit since I last done one of these I mean just looking at this reminded me of how crazy life is right now and I can't even remember what it was like to just be able to go out and normally as you can see here Trader Joe's is doing a great job of keeping everyone six feet apart from each other or at least you know some people six feet is a little bit shorter than other people's six feet you know wearing masks used to be just anesthetic but now it's real life okay now this is seriously why Trader Joe's is my favorite but throughout all this they're actually giving out the grocery bags for free to prevent people from bringing reusable bags and their employees are just awesome they wipe down each and every single one of the cards and have really clear signs up for how to social distance and this is as much social interaction as I'm going to be getting in the next two weeks but seriously you guys I feel like going grocery shopping is now on par with you know what it felt like to go to Disneyland previously gotta get them greens cuz you know your girl has been looking a little extra fluffy since quarantine has started not even gonna lie the asian me knows that the prices per banana not per pound so we're looking for the biggest bananas possible and look at these this is pretty much two bananas in one oh we love the cheeses is especially brie cheese is that why i've been gaining weight when this all began I feel like everything was out of stock but now it's definitely much much better the yeast how this part is that of course the sample station is not open and there is no free coffee by me mochi and I would literally be your best friend especially if it's green tea fun fact I try to make cookies without baking soda last week and I thought it was gonna be fine but they turned out to be rocks so it was not fine and I'm purchasing baking soda here's some awkward b-roll that I made someone else take for me and there we go we are actually paying with Apple pay obviously I have a mask on so face ID didn't work okay and that's as much socialization and sunshine as my introverted but can take so we are heading home  because I paid for my groceries with Apple pay my phone is also now dirty so that's really important to make note of and I'm about to take off my mask so that we can head home so what I'm gonna do is take my pinkie finger hit the loop and then just take it off like that you want to make sure that the dirty part of the mask is not touching your face and that you're also not touching your face with any of your fingers as much as you can even though I already use hand sanitizer you just want to be extra safe and then I'm gonna go ahead and throw the mask in the back I have the biggest itch on my face right now right here but I'm good to refrain from reaching it because I'm not supposed to do it but I wait until I go home wash my hands disinfect everything and then I will but just be really really careful I think I forgot what the stats were but on average we touch our faces like 20 times an hour or something ridiculous like that so obviously with everything going on we all just have to be I I need to be more mindful of what I'm doing  okay so as I'm walking through the door this area has been designated the dirty area of the house so it's all things that like aren't clean so I shouldn't be touched so obviously my camera and my phone and my hands are extremely dirty so I'm gonna first go and disinfect slash wash my hands and also change my clothes and then we will start disinfecting the groceries so I just wash my hands clean my phone clean the camera and now I have a reusable bag that's just been sitting at home everywhere is out of Lysol wipes so I'm just using the alcohol spray and spring it on paper towels and wiping them down we're also going to remove any of the extra packaging that isn't necessary and then go ahead and put them in the clean bag before we put them into their respective places we got our paper towels as well as our alcohol spray make sure that has above 60% alcohol content  for anything that has like extra packaging that isn't necessary we're also just going to take them out and throw them away leaving just the inside so now I'm about to take this very big bag of groceries and go put them in the fridge and then for the dry stuff that doesn't actually need to go in the fridge I'm actually going to quarantine it cuz I'm not going to be eating it immediately anyways hi buddy is this all you do also he got the worst haircut on earth which I wish I would have logged that but I was under the impression that the like razor thing was three centimeters but was actually three millimeters so he's got the roughest haircut on the planet but he's not complaining are you I'm super excited because I finally restocked on my snacks I don't have something to eat for the next week or so and yeah that was a quick vlog for you guys Lucky's playing with those toy chicken in the background I hope you found that entertaining slash useful slash hopeful obviously there is no better way to protect yourself from coronavirus other than staying home and practicing physical distancing and that is all we have for today while he is facing his beauty to us um but yeah don't forget that you are a 10 out of 10 don't let anyone ever let you think otherwise and I'll see you guys really really soon in the next one bye  where it's been 700 degrees in here since you came in and now it's starting to spin
