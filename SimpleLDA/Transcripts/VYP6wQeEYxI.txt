 their diary it has been a week since I have parted with my hair I feel as though the shock value of showing people my lack of has caught up to me they're no longer surprised I feel as though now I must continue to allow my personality to impress people it does not bode well what's up everybody my name is Sam and this is the Internet where things happen and today I'm not necessarily going to be doing anything which kind of defeats the purpose of the name of the channel doesn't it well videos over I guess you could say that I am doing something and that I'm I'm doing a vlog like an actual vlog where I talk about like stuff and myself and things and stuff of that nature so today May 5th as you're watching this will be the 3 year anniversary of me arriving in Seattle after making the choice to depart from my home of Ohio to pursue opportunities out here on the west coast and what I want to do is I kinda want to talk about a little bit of what led to that decision kind of my journey to get from there to here and you know kind of go from there so bear with me see if this is interesting or funny I'm gonna try and say it tell jokes I don't know why that's different from any other time doesn't stop me from being unfunny in every other video whenever I get the question about where I'm from it is always a little bit difficult to answer that question and you'll find that a lot of people who were in the situation that I was may or may not have a similar difficulty answering that question because my father was in the military he was an Air Force and so my life is not traditionally centered around one particular place I have various attachments to the places that I've lived which is you know uh admittedly a very small list of compared to some other people who have been in the same situation as I have I was born in Arizona I have a lot of love and attachment to Phoenix in that area because of you know I was born there my grandparents are still there my siblings are there so I haven't my sports team is there my football team shockingly enough being a fan of the Cardinals in Seattle is the problem I'm convinced that the sticker on my window is the reason why a lot of people don't let be murdered into traffic with nature so I do have a lot of attachment Arizona but I think when somebody asked me where are you from I don't typically need with Arizona or Phoenix or Glendale or where we like however look back right you want to narrow it down right usually as the conversation proceeds and people like ask questions to learn more I'm gonna kind of get the to the well I was born here I lived here from here this is where I consider myself from I think part of that kind of lends itself to the fact that I was a kid like I was very young when I lived in Arizona and so I'm very familiar with the place in the area but like I didn't really experience like a big chunk of life in Arizona right my family was deployed to England my dad was and we moved with him and I was there until I was three and then my parents split up and I moved back to Arizona while my dad remained and I lived there until I was about 12 I have my connections they're happy to have my family and then you know I have my my a one or two friends that I that I like grew up with there but like I don't have a huge like this is different this is a difficult thing to say because I don't want to like come across like I don't appreciate her love the love like where I was born because I do but you know I don't have like a big like my hometown pride doesn't necessarily come from Glendale Arizona you know anything so um I don't typically lead with hey I'm from Arizona the second place that I lived I lived in Ohio for a couple of years after a certain point I went to go live with my my dad who at the time was stationed in Ohio where he is from he's from Lima which is a smaller town up north of Dayton he was stationed there for a couple years before he got stationed to go off to England which is back to England which is I went with in that time and I lived there for a few years with him this was around the time that he met my stepmother Tammy it was wonderful and I think for the first year we lived in England it was just me and my dad and then Tammy and her son my step-brother Rodney moved with us and lived with us there until we moved back to the states when my dad retired he retired to Dayton Ohio which was close enough to his home town that he could be near my grandparents and his siblings but was better for jobs at the time and so I would graduate high school in Ohio I would need a ton of awesome friends in Ohio I would just like my life kind of started in Ohio right what people ask me where I'm from my I don't hesitate usually I'm Vermont oh I'm from Dayton you know look I get it Ohio is kind of a meme we say OPA lot there's lots of corn you know there's you know it's a meme but it's a it's there's something about it man there's something about Ohio there's something about Dayton or something about like all those cities around that area of it like I don't know it's got a special kind of spirit about it you know and it's just like any other place it hasn't bad parts that haven't bad stuff but I mean I it's that's where I'm from man I graduated high school there and I lived there for 10 years before I decided to make this change I was there for one decade and it was a time I met a lot of the greatest people I've ever met you know a lot of like so many of my friends I had such a great network of friends when I lived in Ohio and I still do have that Network like that they didn't go away because I moved you know I met a lot of great people I got a lot of great experiences um and you know I learned to drive in Ohio I you know first time I ever fell in love was in Ohio like I just had like all the dumb you know I uh you know what I mean so I got a lot of love for it and I think my decision to leave was predicated on a couple of factors and I think as much as I love the Ohio and Dayton and as much good stuff happened to me and for me in Dayton my problem was always that a lot of bad stuff happened to you like a lot of like interpersonal stuff really affected me really kind of made had a lot of depression and anxiety and like issues and things like that and it wasn't Ohio's fault it was just the situations that I put myself in and so myself with and so I had a lot of problems work who was you know really miserable I just like I felt myself spinning my wheels I felt like I was trapped in a dead-end I didn't know what I didn't know what to do I didn't understand myself I didn't understand who I was I didn't understand a lot of stuff and I just felt trapped and sad and just kind of not okay usually and so I knew that I needed a change but I didn't know if I was gonna be capable within myself to commit that change change is scary man sometimes change can suck sometimes building to a major change is one of the most impossible things you will ever do in your life and I fully recognize that but you know sometimes sometimes moments happen and they force your hand and force you into change and sometimes that can be bad but a lot of times that's a really good thing in 2016 that was when change kind of came knocking on my door um my my very good friend Kevin who I've known for years and years of this point of almost as long as I lived in Ohio like I'm and pretty soon after I started like working and doing my thing it was his birthday come August of that year every year Kevin's birthday is in August every year I didn't know if you think you knew that but that's how birthdays work is that it's usually on the same day every year so I mean go figure right Kevin and I are part of this group on Facebook called talking ship and talking ship is a very special group because it's a bunch of people who are very similar in their interests and the things that they love and like to clown on each other and just have a lot of fun and it's like a super important like group to me there some of them best people I know are in the talking chip group I met Justin my roommate through talking ship I met some people that I'm going to talk about here in a second through talking ship and it all kind of started as like this group it was it was this gaming forum back in the day I won't get too deep into it but it's important to know what talking ship is much like gaming friends and also don't like get together and have fun and you know talking ship was this group and Kevin joined the group I believe I think I'm pretty sure was it my recommendation I'm gonna take credit for captain being a part of that group because there's no other way he would have met those people except through me I'm pretty sure I'm Kevin I'm sorry it was my fault but Kevin wanted to do something for his birthday he wanted to like go branch off do some kind of adventure and one of the things that came up was Seattle he's visit you know let's go hang out have fun in Seattle and what wound up happening was these two people that we both met through talking ship Jason and Chelsey wonderful married couple didn't know a whole lot about them time actually didn't really even know Chelsea at all just Jason met Chelsey when we went out to visit it and these two are they're as important to me as family at this point like that's you know that's that's who they became to me so just became this thing of let's go visit Seattle so me and Kevin went Justin who at the time lived in Nevada from Nevada also decided to come out our friend West who at the time lived in Alaska also does that day now we all just kind of converged on Jason and Chelsea's office and we had a really great like we had at least stay there for a couple of days and we went to a Mariners game is actually Ken like like rafter ceremony like they were retiring his number of this huge deal and we had a lot of great beers and had a lot of fun we visited the city like we had a great time and it was a lot of fun and at the last day we went to where Jason and Chelsey work Jason took the day off to like hang out with us and get us to the airport and Chelsey worked and so we met Chelsey for lunch I did this mostly as a job because I didn't like I guess I you know I responded because I did like I didn't know the thing that she was about to bring up but I I didn't think there was something I could pull off something you have to know about me is that I burned how hard after high school right just like not like not like burnt out like you like like I chucked a rock bottom and then like ruined my life and whenever that's no I mean like burnt out like I was tired man like I I graduated high school with honors like I had opportunities in front of me to go to school and I know that the fact that I didn't was a a little bit disappointing to a couple people I know I I he he didn't overstate it which I'm always thankful for but like I could feel that my dad was disappointed I think that I didn't go to school at the time at least the expectation when you have a kid and you raise a kid right is that you're going to raise the kid they're gonna do well they're gonna make friends are gonna go to school they're gonna get a job they're gonna you know get married have kids and then take care of you right that's that's the progression and you love them along the way and I think like he had that expectation for me for sure because a he what my dad did was I believe and I could be wrong about this but he went to school for a year and then joined the military and I don't like I haven't really talked to him about like the reasoning for that but what I think he wanted was something better for me so I could branch out and do the thing so when I tell you that I was not expecting um to be getting jobs in the industry that I currently work in with my background and level of education I truly mean I was working a mattress store I I had I was miserable I had no idea where I was going in life and I thought I was doing okay selling mattresses and being a Salesman even though I like hated it like in my heart it killed me inside to be that kind of person even though I was pretty good at it and it just was never for me and so I didn't expect like I just expected my life to be does the COS of string of like retail and sales and yeah I could be a manager in those those you know industries but it just wasn't something that spark joy in my heart when we were sitting at lunch Jason and Chelsea were having a conversation about this job that was coming up Chelsea mentioned that the person who would get this job would need experience in Adobe and one of the things that I did growing up is that I taught myself how to use Photoshop and you know all these different Adobe applications just for fun I was poor and so I didn't necessarily obtain the Adobe suite in the most scrupulous of ways and we'll leave it at that that has changed now you know as like a 15 16 year-old kid I found ways to use Adobe and taught myself and I did like I made like art for dumb forums to put in signatures and stuff like that and I just always like Photoshop people on to things and it was like like you know it was something I enjoy doing and when Chelsea said the person who does this job needs to be able to use the Adobe suite I said I can use the Adobe suite and Chelsea said really and I said yeah and she goes are you looking for a job and I said I could be and she says would you be willing to relocate to Seattle and I said yeah and that's kind of where it's it's no we wouldn't home I went back to my job and then Chelsea started like coaching me and like punching up helping me punch up my resume and let help me submit you know apply for a job out there it was really easy to almost give up when I got that first rejection I was just like I'll never be able to do this these are jobs that require like X years of you know experience plus this degree in blah blah so I was like I'm never gonna do this sometimes that you have that voice in your head that tells you that you can't do something and it's super easy to just listen to it it becomes an issue and that's why a lot of people don't like go for things because it wasn't that voice and they're scared so answering that voice and listening to it is is it's a human thing but breaking out and saying no I can keep doing this and I can prevail and succeed is super important as well sometimes for your own sake ignoring that voice and breaking out of your box and moving forward is is incredibly important for your own personal development and for your own happiness and I was so unhappy and I didn't know what else to do and so yeah I didn't listen to the voice and I could let Chelsie and Jason keep helping me and I applied for another job and I wasn't quite there in that respect but what wound up happening is that Bjorn who is a wonderful person my my first boss when I moved to Seattle he said look I like you you're a good interview I'm gonna put you on our bench and if something comes up we'll call you and have you apply it for that and I said sweet that sounds great so eventually this project coordinator job within a construction project service team popped up and Bjorn called me back and said hey we want you to apply for this I said I'd cool let's do it and I did and I interviewed and I got the job the thing that I didn't tell a lot of people especially my family because it's like that's prime anxiety stuff is that the position itself was not a full-time position it was a temporary position I got the phone call when I was at work and I stepped outside to make the call and beorin told me hey think about it call me back on Monday because it was a Friday I believe and is it calling back on Monday tell me what you think and then we'll go from there talked to my dad and talked to Chelsea and I wound up accepting the position the expectation was that if I did well it wouldn't be a temp position forever it was attempt to hire work you know you know best laid plans right that's the idea but like I didn't know if I was gonna be good at this I didn't know anything about the world of construction project in commercial real estate like that's not I knew nothing I had no degree I had no experience I just had a good attitude and I had some managerial experiences but that's it I just like I I didn't know I didn't know it's gonna be a gas couldn't a mistake I accepted the position and then I started making my plans and I started saying goodbye to all these people that you know have meant so much to me over the 10 years that I lived in Ohio and and as an adult and it was hard I cried a lot which is it for anybody who knows me is not a surprise that I cried oh I get that from my dad for sure he's like that cries a lot wind blows wrong my dad it's not that bad it's not that bad at all that's all my favorite things is that my dad was never like toxic in his masculinity and who he was and so I learned from an early age that was okay to be old things you know it was okay to be a human and it's okay to cry and it's okay to be emotional have those go and have that you know in your heart and so I did I met a lot of people I I cried a lot I think my favorite moment was my friend Cheyenne I was really into this the to sweet which is a wrestling thing where you do that and it's and Cheyenne refused to do it it refused to do it and on my thing was like my one of my last nights we had had a huge gathering in this like bar and I had a bunch of friends there and I was drunk as and so was everybody else it was a lot of fun and I died I said Cheyenne since I'm leaving get a tooth sweet she didn't start it's all being it was such a great moment and yeah I am say goodbye to a lot of people and I love to say goodbye to my family and then it was time to go this was a lengthy journey I sold all of my big furniture everything else like my clothes my TV like all like my smaller things I packed up into the back of my car and I booked it for the west coast and so I'm driving almost exactly across America the only way I could have been further away is if I was like on like in New York or like somewhere on the East Coast I was very like close to being a full drive across America this is the route that I took to get there there was a lot there and I broke it up into three day Chuck 12 hours of driving and I tell you what I'm sure it would have been a fine trip if I had somebody else to break up the monotony of just driving all the time but three 12-hour days of driving is enough to drive a Cuban insane like I felt like I was going to lose my mind it was not good the first night I made it to Minnesota a small town called Brainerd where I guess was where they actually filmed Fargo the movie I think could be wrong I don't know don't quote me don't at me leave me alone it's just when I was told the next place I stopped on the second night was Big Timber Montana which if Big Timber was bigger than what I saw I you know was probably a mile or two down the road because what I saw Big Timber Montana was a parking lot with a hotel a gas station a family diner and it was something I was it was interesting it was interesting place hotel is nice it was a nice place to get people were nice and I talked to and I'm sure there was more to the town but it was very small great view of the mountains though Big Timber Montana and driving across Montana was rough because it literally just stretches of nothing only saving grace is that I was able to drive like 90 the entire time except for like the little bits of construction that there were so that was cool it's put on cruising listening to like musicals and podcasts and whenever I could get my hands on after I left Big Timber that was my final stretch I was gonna be there within the day I left early that morning I would have been there that evening um and it was it was getting closer it was getting real my one my one highlight I think from driving from Big Timber to Seattle WA as I was listening to a true-crime podcast and they were telling a story about this murder that took place in Coeur d'Alene Idaho and they started talking about it when I was crossing through Carter Lee in Idaho and that freaked me out a did that but I was my catalyst returning the podcast often turning on turning on some like nice musicals to make me happy and not scared out of my mind I was calling my dad and updating my family the whole trip and I remember as I was getting close to my destination my dad calls me he was hey are you there yet and I said not quite I'm like five minutes away and he said well you're basically hurt and we just had like a really quick talk and he told me that he left me and then uh call him when I got settled and told my word and I was there I made it a little city baby I made it on May 5th 2017 nearly a year after that whole trip in the summer and the conversation that I had with Chelsey and Jason about changing everything I showed up Jason and Chelsea's house Justin came home from work because he had been living there he moved a couple months before I did back in March of that year and even living with Jason and Chelsey until I showed up as we didn't realize together it was really surreal being there and knowing that like that was where I live now and I remember it was Cinco de Mayo when we ordered pizza it took the weekend met up with some friends that we had out there got some extra clothes for my first day at work and then that Monday it's my first day and it was just kind of the beginning of everything I wound up getting a full-time position on the same team it was the same position just on is not a temporary position with him up for months September of that year I had a full-time position with the company and that was a super big relief for me and it good like I think it's I think I'm far enough away from it where I can admit that I did a good job I've never I'm not like the hugest most confident person in the world taking credit for like success is hard for me just being you know I I'm I try to be humble but like I get a really humble sometimes and it's a detriment because I'm not you know basking in the stuff that I should be if I'm not accepting and celebrated my achievements and all these other things and so it was hard to admit them that I did a good job but it did and it afforded me opportunities and new positions and things of that nature and it got me to a place where I am now three years later still no college degree just a good attitude and and willingness to learn a really great spot at work I've met so many incredible people that I would consider at this point family and it's just been such a wild ride three years is in the pantheon of time it's not a huge like long time but I've lived a lot of life in these three years I've learned a lot about being myself I've learned a lot about the things that I need and my personal growth I've learned so much and I wouldn't trade it for anything do I miss Dayton yeah do I miss the people and the family yeah of course every day but I did something for myself then it made me a better person and it gave me so many opportunities and it let me meet so many incredible people and I couldn't ask for better yeah good answer hey we want you to you know talk to some people about this and I hate and
