 Oh today is the start of week number five of quarantine and it seems like you guys really liked seeing what happened during week three I didn't vlog last week but I decided to continue this little like weekly series and show you guys what I'm doing on week number five on Easter was yesterday I didn't do anything I watched Church online and I made brownies I found a recipe on YouTube and actually it was really good so I will link the video what I use to make these brownies it's like crazy raining out right now and I decided to do a lot of like house stuff so I'm gonna do laundry and I'm gonna check out my basement laundry I've never done laundry down there because if you saw my apartments where I'm like terrified of the basement I found out it's like way cheaper than the laundromat down the street and also like I don't really want to do laundry right now in like a public laundromat so I found this little laundry tip for like washing white sheets it's putting some baking soda in your washing and then you put the vinegar where your fabric softener should go and then you use your regular detergent and allegedly it makes your sheets whiter and brighter so I've been doing it for a while and I think works so these are the brownies that I made for Easter obviously I was hungry obviously they are so good I had some for breakfast I know   so the weather is horrible right now but I figure I have to run errands this week I might as well do it when it's like the worst weather possible so I don't have to see anybody you know so I'm getting coffee for the week I like to go to my favorite coffee place we'll do laundry and then I have to do a target run because I'm gonna like do my whole house and just get like target cleaning supplies and a rainy everyday but so far like no one's outside so Satan  so now I have the joy of folding all the laundry  so it's just about five o'clock it's been horribly raining all day long and I think it's time to make a cocktail I created the most delicious mezcal cocktail and only takes three ingredients so these are the three ingredients you'll need to make this drink first you'll start off with this raspberry fruit spread from Trader Joe's it sounds so weird to use in the cocktail but you just heat it up with water then you squeeze an ounce of lime fresh lime juice and two ounces of your mezcal shake it up and you have a cocktail morning so yesterday was like the best day to go shopping because Olin was outside however the target that I normally go to was sold out of everything so I'm headed to another target early this morning I've never been to this one apparently it's like super big it's like on 34th Street so I'm gonna bike there no one is outside so that should be interesting  sergeant arsenic - so I've actually never been to that target and it's so big inside definitely going back I got a lot of things that I needed but there still are no paper towels in Manhattan there's tons of toilet paper though so we just need to get the paper towels back on the shelves and it will be good but I got napkins I guess in the meantime but now we're headed off to the wine shop because survival meeting Winer  like this come back home from the store and I like running errands outside just because they can get a little bit of a walk in however there are some characters outside though it's not that it's like unsafe but there's just a lot of weird people outside even when we were at one store we saw a guy stealing canned goods and the cop came over and I don't know what happened but that was something that we witnessed so a lot of strange things going on in the background however I did find my paper towels which were so hard to find I had to go through four different stores to find them so that's great I also got two bottles of wine I did watch this whole documentary series on Hulu about some a liaison line and it made me appreciate wine making so if you have Hulu and are interested in wine I would check out it's called Psalm and there's I think three or four parts one is passing the sommelier test and the other to just show like wine makers and how they can like literally smell a bottle and know exactly where it's from that's a skill I would love to have but anyway these are my collection of Trader Joe's shopping bags so Trader Joe's is like a grocery store here in the US and it's just like really quirky so I have collected these bags from places that I've traveled to I got this one in San Francisco and it has a cute little like Napa Valley side ones from Boston and it has cute little Boston things and then this one's from Wisconsin where I'm from very much farmer and the sides are cows look how cute is this so I'm collecting them whenever I travel somewhere new I'm always grabbing a Trader Joe's reusable bag and they come in handy and it's like always fun to remember your trips that you've taken when you take out your bag and like I've done so many questions about where I got this bag because you can't find this in New York City we have a cool Brooklyn Bridge one but I've lost so I'm gonna put all these cleaning supplies away at treats right now we're so beautiful it's like pink beautiful trees normally I would have been totally outside taking photos and just like enjoying the spring weather the tulips are just gorgeous and blooming everywhere I wish the trees on my street your pain but they're not today is probably one of the nicer days of the whole week so I'm gonna go on my fire escape and catch a tan I have my swimsuit on and I'm ready kind of caught the tan line or like the previous weeks and of course I've made a little cocktail and kind of Tim you use all the liquor that I have in my cabinet either for like years and this is like the perfect opportunity to just like get rid of it so I made a sick Gila cocktail  good morning good morning last night I painted my nails peachy color I think it's called like can June shrimp or something from OPI so I'm headed downstairs just to pick up on my laundry that I did another load because it's so cheap I'm so like obsessed now and I left my apartment door and there's a pigeon in the hallway not sure how the pigeon got into the hallway but I guess it's a New York City thing smell it so I tried a little piece right here and wow this is so so good this is like my favorite thing I've been making lately it's just like ground beef with like marinara and tomatoes that's so delicious can't wait to dig in so I thought I'd give you guys a little update on what the situation is like here in York New York is getting better it's not like drastically better every day but hospitals can take on the patient however unfortunately there are a lot of deaths that are happening and new cases still every day but the general trend is that it's like lower than usual looks like it's getting better but I don't think we'll be 100% anytime soon an overall sense of like we can get through this so that's great another update for New York is that starting tomorrow everyone will be required to wear a face mask when they're outside til there is a lot of sadness for lots of families and people who work on the front line so we're still going through it but things seem a bit more optimistic than they have in the past and also the extension is now until May 15th May 15th I just need to stop baking at this point so it's time for a little movie night and I have my movie theater popcorn ready to go and some amazing chocolate chip cookies gonna have a junk food situation got my red wine I'm gonna watch parasite good morning everyone so I am about to film another YouTube video behind me I have my setup going on over here I'm gonna show you guys how I set up a talking head YouTube video in my room making like a studio I have to bring lights a DSLR camera and I'm filming a hair tutorial cuz obviously the hair is not done I'm doing like a dry shampoo video and when it's live I'll be sure to link it right here because I'm making it right now and you can see how much better the lighting is with just a bring light so I'm gonna start filming this video because I think I've been taking about like an hour or two I'm doing a three different look so this is what my hair it looks like down a bit way the other bruise is where I you should have  so I'm officially done filming the video it took an hour not to so that's great so now we are required to wear a face mask in public started yesterday and most people have long but send us a lot of masks I'm waiting in line that hopefully Ivan's for the week   I'm going on a bike right now  so I added some more lights this is the final result this is gonna be a very obnoxious I've been all the way over
