I'm not trying to catch a coat or are the corona period but we just really enjoying some time we like fresh air is so it's like it's literally like medicine like it just feels so good so I just thought I would voiceover that call any type of you Darla proponent hello to charge my phone's about to die but yeah if you guys have never seen Chicago like this is the Buckingham Fountain but it's clearly off I don't think it's gonna turn out for a minute now all right you guys so hopefully you can't even see me I'm not like this because this lighting is so trashed but anywho I am on my way to Trader Joe's I have not gone to the grocery store in a pretty long time I've been trying not to go really often just because like that's just ridiculous and basically what you guys saw I did yoga class this morning with my roommate which was really really fun we've been trying to do like this yoga challenge which has been going pretty well and yoga is just so amazing and I've been really trying to make sure that I'm still moving make sure that I'm still proving you guys this is a really good time to really prep for summer because summer will not be canceled in Jesus name someone will not be came to it but I did that yoga video then I also did a butt workout video and I also did a ab workout video you guys can see my braids I'm not sure if it'll be in this vlog that I show you guys me like doing my braids but I definitely have some vlog footage of that so yeah I just did my own box way to the other day there like the knotless box braids I really really like them but yeah this is a really good time to really just lock in on some discipline and that's something that I've been trying to do get more disciplined with like getting up and doing yoga in the morning and you guys honestly like not even joking it makes all the difference like it makes all the difference yes I've been working out but like working out in the morning and setting sorry it's really bright because the Sun is bright setting your intentions for the day honestly like it's a huge game-changer it just changed the game for me and I'll let the people out her jogging so anyway yeah at this vlog it's just kind of like random footage of me while in quarantine and things like that definitely not gonna like love every day because I feel like that would be boring but I definitely do want to vlog something so I'll show you guys some stuff that I get from Trader Joe's just some staples that I have run out of so he has  something about grocery shopping especially during this time like do not Ford and making a list just makes things a lot more realistic like making a list just has always made grocery shopping a lot better because then you don't end up buying things you don't need how have you guys been doing now I really do want to check in with you guys if you guys are watching this vlog leave a comment and let me know what have you been doing to kind of like past the time especially

back  are you guys so I just got to target honestly it was kind of funny in Trader Joe's because the lady was like yeah could you step back a little bit it was like they had like marks for people where they should stand and stuff like that like in line so she was like yeah I honestly just feel so like rude even saying that she said but we need everyone to stand at the line so yeah if you guys gonna go to the store just know that they do have you standing a certain distance from other customers but anyway I had brought some lemon water from home on my way out in a mason jar just like some hot water with a little bit of lemon this looks like it's like me just so that I could drink that while I'm out it's honestly been kind of revolutionary how people are really taking precautions this dude next to me just got back to his car and he like it's sanitizing his hands before he gets to his car make sure that you guys still do get fresh and even though we're supposed to be inside what you know I'm totally taking serious I do think getting fresh air is really healthy and like I'm just doing things you know around the house that's really healthy and like that you know uplifts you and so far you guys so I just got back and I just set everything out and I actually just sanitized everything with a Lysol wipes just because I ain't about to get coronavirus out here so I just thought I would kind of give you guys a quick grocery haul I ran a lot of coffee creamer so I got some of that it was himself out of juice shot got some dairy-free yogurt some cucumbers veggie burgers like a salad mix romaine lettuce fiber bars I needed some more ginger for my smoothies mango for my smoothies edamame and then the guilty pleasure these are so  are you guys so now I'm in my room I'm at my desk actually I don't know if you guys have ever seen do you guys have seen my desk and I'm gonna get some work done and I have my breakfast the yogurt that I just bought this like silk dairy free yogurt I absolutely love it lactose intolerant problems I just cannot consume like normal dairy doesn't make me feel good at all weirder it comes from mmm which is don't sit well what's that like but
