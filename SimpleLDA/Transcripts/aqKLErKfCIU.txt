   hi guys good morning so I just went through Starbucks I swear like I really don't go to Starbucks that much but lately I've been going like every other day which is bad and a lot of money but oh well I do it's like a treat for myself and like to motivate myself to do blue mark so yeah I got my Starbucks and I also got one for Jacob he slept over last night and he's still I think in bed and then this morning we're just probably to make breakfast I had to do some homework and then I have a test today that I have to take if you don't know I am a student at Florida State University but I am taking a class at a local Community College online but I had it there because over the summer I was going to be home because I went going from a dorm to minute partment so like I had the scalper I didn't have anywhere to live in Tallahassee but now that everything is online I'm just taking it online and it's business calc so yeah it's been kind of tricky and it's really fast like it's an accelerated course because it's only six weeks long so you have another test today I have to do that and then yeah I don't really know what else we'll be doing today but I'll keep you updated for breakfast we're having toast and eggs this literally has been like my everyday breakfast lately and I've been like quarantine has really got me into honey I've been putting honey on my toast and stuff and I also get the honey coffee at Starbucks I'm also having a green juice yeah okay now that we're awake you can make my bed   okay so finally I'm finished with my homework it's 2:15 I was sitting on my computer for so long I took my um test I did pretty well and I like I'm happy with what I got because it's really hard class but when I was doing my homework the pretty little thing order came in the mail we take you I put a little same order came in the mail which I was not expecting till June 2nd so I'm gonna do a little haul I'm just pulling out about this like there's no like there's no order to this I'm just pulling you out of the bag okay so first thing you know is just a spell chain it's actually kind of loops like from your from the belt I don't know felt like that but I was like yeah I got this sneak belt another thin Jesus and I got these lime-green sweatpants I thought these are gonna be like on the website they look like a pale kind of green and they're really thin so honestly if like they didn't really see through will even see if I can wear those but they'll be soft and comfy noose around the house next thing I got were these like tan beige pants these look so comfortable I just have like an elastic waistband and then they kind of flare out like a wider leg I just think these would be cute with like you know like casual is like Air Force Ones like a white shirt or I can wear my um platforms I have at these make a little fancier and they just seem really comfy so I'm excited about those and they seem nice he's really thicker yeah I like these and next thing you thought was a black fanny pack these are really good for game days because you're allowed only like a little bag or a clear bag but I only have a cheetah print one so I wanted to get just like a plain bag and also I want to try wearing it like over the chest like thanks I think that's really cute the next thing I got was just a plain cropped black t-shirt I always read cropped shirts I don't have like a plain black one so I'm really excited this and this is so soft like it just feels so nice I think that was this one shoulder like gold metallic cheetah top I love cheetah print like oh my friend made fun of it because there's so much cheaper I don't have anything off the shoulder it actually goes this way and then just sensors are here so it's cropped and I think you could just like be nice I go up to dinner with him stuff like that so I'm really excited about this and I was worried that it'd be see-through because on the website like I couldn't really tell what the material was but it's not it's like just gold and everything he came with matching shorts but I wanted to see if I liked the print first but maybe go buy the shorts but who knows I might just play this with like mom jeans really excited I'm saying really excited about that everything ok the next thing I'm really excited about it's just this big white t-shirt to wear with my biker shorts cuz I always wear biker shorts I'm wearing them right now but I usually only wear them with the crop tops cuz I don't have like a good oversized shirt to wear did that like covers my butt and stuff so I wanted like a long just plain one and I also I think about like two other oversized shirts were in biker shorts but really like that the next thing I got was or the next thing I got are these cheetah print liner 7 love geo print biker shorts they have like a skinny waistband which I am NOT like the biggest fan of I like one the waistband is thicker so kind of like sucks you in more but these are still nice I think that we really comfy I think there might be a little see-through left to see but I can always just wear like an oversized shirt and instead of a crop top so I'd really like those the next thing is this pink cardigan with like these little kind of like balloon sleeves I guess they're more like like bigger at the bottom and it's solved and it's cropped I think this would be cute with like a tighter tank top or t-shirt under it with just some jeans it's cute and I really like the color okay the next thing is another oversized shirt or biker shorts but I don't know if it'll be long enough it's just this purple shirt that says 1987 New York wild and free it's like was really good to wear shirt like from a concert at World Tour I don't even know if this is like an actual like tour from like a singer but I really like the colors and I don't really I don't know any purple so I thought this would be different last I got was another oversized shirt for biker short I thought this would be cute with the cheetah ones it's just a black shirt this is Chicago  nevermind that's not the last thing I got this white cropped t-shirt that is gonna be a little tighter so I could wear with that cardigan that I talked about and that I showed it's super soft but something really see-through but I like how the sleeves are a little longer I think that'll be like pretty flattering yeah so that is it for the hull I'm really excited about everything I got and I'll try to link everything down below for let you think it's still available and stuff I bought everything when it was the 50% off sale
