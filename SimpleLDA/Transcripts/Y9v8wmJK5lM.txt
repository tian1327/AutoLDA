  welcome back Emily I want to kind of hop on here and tell you how the last few weeks have been going for us this is a really scary time in the world for everyone we are going through a pandemic and I think we're all a little scared but I just kind of wanted to share what I've been dealing with through all of this  so at the beginning when this was all kind of starting I just saw a lot of jokes about it and it definitely wasn't something I was taking super serious I don't think anyone was expecting it to get to where it is and I didn't really know much about it and I didn't make an effort to know much about it I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder with panic and I'm the type of person who will think in the worst-case scenario and scare myself and just being a constant state of panic over something that I don't need to be so this was something that I thought would just cause an unnecessary panic in my life and at the time it didn't really seem that serious no one was really taking it seriously so I was like I'm not gonna look into it I'm not gonna read the articles I'm gonna just roll past everything I see about it I really just had the mindset of ignorance is bliss and if I don't know about it then I can't freak out about it so my mom called me one day and she was kind of talking to me about it and she was like well what are you gonna do about like at the hospital I don't like what are you talking about like I'm just gonna go to the hospital and have my baby I mean it's like we're gonna get coronavirus from like whatever really two patients are sitting on the other side of the hospital in quarantine and she's like you have really been keeping up with what's going on huh like no I just I'd rather not and she's like you might have to do a home birth and after that I was like okay it's time like I need to figure out what's going on for the safety of my family because it's past a point of I'd rather not know and at this point in order for us to be safe and healthy I need to educate myself so I did and I'm really glad I did because now I know what safety precautions that we need to take but at the same time it has caused a lot of anxiety for me and it's been really really hard as someone who is pregnant I am considered a high-risk meaning I'm kind of in the same boat as anyone over the age of like 60 or who has a pre-existing condition like lung issues or really any major health issues me and all those other people are put in a category of if we get this illness it will not be good for us it's definitely dangerous so at this point it is a major concern of mine I have not left my house in over a week Landon went to the grocery store and got some supplies for us and of course was very precautious with that and other than that neither of us or Colette has been outside at all with that comes a lot of time to just sit here and think and read about what's going on and honestly it's been driving me crazy I've always feared that this baby would come early I take progesterone shots once a week in hopes that she doesn't come early and to try and prevent that from happening collect came early at 33 weeks and I'm 31 weeks so that was already a fear that I had but now it's just gotten to a whole new level of I can't have her coming into this world with all this going on I've been reading about what's been going on in Italy and they're kind of a little bit ahead of us with this virus they have been dealing with this for longer than we have and it's had time to spread and it's gotten to the point where hospitals are closing down whole entire hospitals all across Italy are turning into coronavirus hospitals basically and all of their she is kind of going towards that and they're at the point where they're making decisions on is this old man even worth helping obviously they want to help everyone they can but he doesn't have that great of a chance of survival while this young person does so our attentions going to go towards them and people are dying because they can't get the help they need I have always dreamed of having a home birth but that's not something that would be safe for me because Colette did come through c-section and I've never had a natural birth before my goal is it was to have a natural birth but that takes a lot of extra attention and just making sure that everything goes well and monitoring where the doctors and my natural birth could very well turn into a c-section really fast but if the hospitals are closed down and you know they're having to let patients pass away because they don't have what they need to take care of them they don't have any beds left then someone who's in labor isn't gonna take priority over someone who's dying and I might have to give birth in my home which is terrifying to me um I have no idea what I'm doing I've never had a natural birth before if it gets to that point and I have to have a c-section and I'm stuck in my home and there's no one to give me a c-section and there's no way of me accessing health care at that time then something really bad could happen to me in the baby I'm 31 weeks and I had cut at 33 weeks and could hop this baby at 32 weeks and that would be right in the middle of of everything going on I'm terrified they're saying that this could be a global problem until July I'm due May 19th so I mean she is gonna be born into the corona virus pandemic unfortunately I just I'm hoping it's at a stage where I can access you know the medical care that I need and hopefully it past enough by then where the hospitals aren't so full so we've just been praying and praying and staying at home and trying not to think about that it's just been so and it sucks to see people not taking it seriously because they aren't really affected by it like oh well if I get it it's just the flu so it doesn't matter I'm gonna go out and do whatever I want and live my life like I normally do they're going out and spreading it around and making the problem worse when they're only hurting people like me and sick people and elderly people and it's just so sad to see people be so selfish just because it doesn't directly affect you doesn't mean you can't do your part to stop it from spreading more because right now I have to leave my house for the first time in a week and I don't have a choice I need to go get medication so my daughter doesn't come early I have a check-up with my OBGYN and I'm looking forward to getting some answers about what's gonna happen what is their plan what's the hospital doing am I going to be able to deliver my baby at the hospital you know questions like that and finally get some answers and hopefully they will calm my nerves and then right after that I have to get my progesterone shot I'm so scared to leave my house I'm so scared and obviously I'm taking every precaution necessary and I just really hope I come back safe and with a peace of mind and some answers so I'm gonna head out go out into the world for the first time in a while this feels so weird after not leaving my house for so long to be getting in the car and going somewhere obviously Lina and Colette aren't coming with me because it's not necessary and you know the more people out there touching things the more germs to be spread all the stores are out of hand sanitizer because people want to stock up and buy all of it and not leave any for anyone else so I have this little tiny thing of hand sanitizer and I actually bought this for my diaper bag for when she's born I guess I have to use it now all right I'm all done at the doctor it definitely wasn't great news first of all I'm anemic and I have low iron in my blood so I'm gonna have to take some supplements to try and get that up and in two weeks they're gonna draw my blood and see if it's helped at all and if not I might have to have an iron transfusion they really don't want me going to labor with low iron because I might lose it too much blood and that would not be good so that's just another thing to worry about and then as far as the hospital goes as of right now and this might change get better or get worse but as of right now they put in new procedures and rules for labor and delivery at this point all non-essential parts of the hospital have already shut down they're not doing any procedures that aren't urgent and the only part of the hospital that's open is the emergency rooms and the woman's Center I'm no longer allowed to have to support people in the room with me for the birth I'm only allowed to have one which is obviously gonna be Landin so it's just me and landon and no one's allowed to visit us in the hospital especially not colette it is just gonna be us going in and out and no one can even see the baby until we're discharged landon might not even be able to be there for the birth if he has any kind of symptoms if he has a fever they're gonna do a full screening on him and if he's sick then he is not allowed to come to the birth and I'd be completely by myself giving birth to this baby and that saw it's just so terrified they don't know at least the last time I had my mom with me and she was there free but I'm just really scared and I really hope things get better before she comes I need to go pick up my prescription for the iron supplements my heart has not stopped racing since I left the house I smell anxious say this has to be hands like probably a hundred times I need to get my medication so I go do that I got what I need and I'm just so ready to be home and safe and just be with my family what's going on out here are we getting some fresh air  Ozzy you're gonna get lost over there it's a jungle that's why the grass is so small because she's not here watering
