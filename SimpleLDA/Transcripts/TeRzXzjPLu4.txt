   Piper's heart thank you for joining us for our weekly vlog June 2020 is going to be a very powerful month that will give awakening humanity the opportunity to transcend the obsolete patterns of separation and duality in new ways the illusion of humanity's separation from God and each other has kept us trapped in negative behavior patterns for lifetimes now it is time for us to realize that this self-destructive belief is nothing more than a lie this month we will experience a rare triple Eclipse series that will coincide with the June solstice be added in flecks of light that will bathe the planet during these celestial alignments will give the I am presence of every person on earth the opportunity to accelerate the awakening that is taking place on a global scale during the forced time out humanity is experiencing as a result of the Kovach 19 virus the first of these three-part Eclipse series will be a partial full moon lunar eclipse that will occur on June 5th this full moon occurs during the Sun cycle of Gemini and is celebrated around the world as the goodwill festival of humanity this global festival revels in the oneness of the family of humanity and the divine love and enlightenment that has been bathing the earth from the two previous full moon festivals which took place during the Sun cycles of Aries and Taurus the added impetus of a lunar eclipse on June 5th will exponentially expand the light of God on earth in ways that will accelerate humanity's aware of the oneness of all life the second part of this triple Eclipse series will be a new moon solar eclipse that will coincide with the June solstice on the weekend of June 20th and 21st this is also the weekend that we celebrate Father's Day in the United States of America the celestial alignment that takes place during the June solstice every year provides the solar logos from Suns beyond Suns the opportunity to bathe the earth in higher frequencies of fifth-dimensional crystalline solar light this is the light that the I am presence of our fifth dimensional body elemental and our I am presence use to transfigure our carbon-based planetary bodies into the fifth dimensional crystalline based solar light bodies that we will all abide in on the new earth the added impetus of both a new moon and a solar eclipse during the June solstice will exponentially expand this process of divine alchemy within our earthly bodies the final part of this triple Eclipse series will occur on July 4th with another partial full moon lunar eclipse in the United States of America July 4th is celebrated as Independence Day this year with the awakening that is taking place through our forced time out and the planetary reboot unfolding on earth the company of heaven in the I am presence of every person will be able to raise the consciousness of the masses to a higher level of enlightenment please mark your calendars and pay attention to these opportunities ask your I am presence and the company of heaven how you can most effectively add to the light of the world during these celestial events there is no doubt that this is an unprecedented time in the lives of all of humanity and people have very conflicting and often extreme perceptions about what is actually happening on earth however in the midst of all of the chaos one thing is being made very clear to all of us and that is that we are interconnected and interdependent no matter what illusions of separation we think exist regardless of the original source of the Kovach 19 virus astonishingly in just a matter of a few weeks we watched this virus spread from a small market in Wuhan China to every country in the world this virus is clearly demonstrating that the family of humanity is one collective body of human beings and that we are all in this together with this global pandemic we are seeing that what affects one of us in a positive way lifts the hearts of all of us and what affects one of us negatively hurts all of us in one way or another the belief that we are somehow separate from each other because of our gender race religion nationality culture age or lifestyle has caused more fear and problems than just about anything else this erroneous belief has given our fear-based human ego the idea that it is on its own and that whatever it needs to do to survive and to get what it wants is perfectly OK this narcissistic consciousness is the basis of humanity's destructive and self-obsessed dog-eat-dog and looking out for number one attitude when we fell from grace eons ago we began perpetuating the illusion of separation and duality our fragmented and fear-based ego began believing that our physical body is all that we are and that the physical plane of earth is all that exists when that happened our ego came to the erroneous conclusion that it's very purpose and reason for being was to gratify its physical senses our ego decided that even if it needed to lie steal cheat or kill to accomplish its self-centered goal of instant gratification that would be just fine but now everything has changed humanity is awakening and our fallen human ego no longer has the ability to manipulate and control us the way it used to no matter how hard it tries we are beginning to hear the still small voice of our I am presence and to receive divine guidance once again from deep within the recesses of our heart flame we are remembering profound truths that will empower each of us to reverse the adverse effects of our human egos erroneous belief system in separation and duality the most important thing our I am presence wants us to remember at this time is that we are one and that there is no separation this means quite literally that there is no such thing as us and them I know MIT for many people that concept just borrows the mind for others the oneness of life seems like a sweet sentiment but they do not comprehend the magnitude of what that profound truth really means we are one means that every single son and daughter of God throughout the whole of creation is interconnected interrelated and interdependent in addition to that profound truth every atomic and subatomic particle and wave of life that has ever been breathed forth from the core of creation by our Father mother God still lives moves breathes and has it's being in the all-encompassing divine matrix that forms our godparents body the amazing thing that we are remembering about the fact that we are one with all life is that every single thought feeling word and action we express day by day with every breath we take affects every facet of life in our father mother God's divine matrix this means that depending on our frame of mind daily and hourly we are either adding to the light of the world or we are adding to the pain and suffering just imagine as the masses of humanity awaken and remember that we are one they will comprehend in brand-new ways that if a person inflict harm on any person place condition or thing for their own selfish gain it will result not only in the suffering of others but in their own self-destruction as well with this awareness no one of sound mind will be willing to deliberately wreak this kind of havoc in their own life experience by behaving in such an abhorrent way as the reality that we are one awakens in every person's heart the good news is if a fable also realize that every thought feeling word or action they express that is based in a consciousness of divine love oneness or reverence for all life will bless every person place condition and thing on earth and greatly enhance the love and harmony in their own life as well this information means that we are not just the victims of circumstance being randomly buffeted about by situations beyond our control we are the co-creators of our lives and if we do not like the way things are going by remembering that we are beloved sons and daughters of God and that we are one with all life we can change our course of action and create a new life for ourself based in love peace happiness abundance vibrant health and the heart based desire for the highest good of all concerned dear one in order to help the masses of humanity to take full advantage of the in flexes of light we will receive throughout the month of June in 2020 please make the heart commitment to focus on each person's I am presence anything a person does that reflects something less than divine love simply ask their I am presence to take control of their thoughts feelings words and actions and to guide them to their highest divine potential then ask their I am presence to blaze the violet flame of God's infinite perfection in through and around everything they have ever that conflicts with divine love know that there I am presence will accomplish this in perfect alignment with their divine plan god bless you dear one I look forward to being with you next week
