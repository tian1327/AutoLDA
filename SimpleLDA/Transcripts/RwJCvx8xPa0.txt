  hey everyone welcome back to my youtube channel if it's your first time joining this is catanjali from queens new york and today is may 26 2020 here i am doing another vlog and how it is to live in new york city during quarantine this vlog is super fun especially if you're an art lover so you would find a typical new yorker like myself especially after work during the week at in the chelsea neighborhood and that's where all the art galleries are here is where strangers come from all over new york tri-state as well as taurus and they make their way into existing our new art galleries where they support the new artists i feel as though most of the folks and to be honest like most of us go there yes to enjoy the art but also for the free wine  and to meet new people that's one of the things that i miss and i figure i'll do a vlog here i am sitting at home with my rose i'd like to take you all on this little journey in my 400 square foot studio apartment in new york city there are three paintings i have in my place and each painting in my home has a story to it so yeah let's go this is my first canvas and purchased this in vancouver canada in 2015 and i went to visit the granville island and there's a really cool story behind this canvas my parents have been married for 47 years two months after they were married and they went to canada toronto canada and um a year later that's when my brother was born so this canvas is very meaningful to me because i wanted to have some kind of art in my space it reminds me of my brother's birth country it also makes me very proud that my parents had the opportunity to go work internationally at some point in their life before they settle down in america my parents and i left our birth country british guyana so we could start a new life in new york city so when i invested in my own place i always wanted to have a painting of new york city and the skyline to show that i too was able to live the american dream this painting i was able to get on amazon and i think it was only for like 24 but it means a lot to me now it's time for the third and final painting in my space and i actually got a little creative so for new yorkers for those who actually live in a very tiny space i don't have windows where my sleeping zone is so about five years ago i actually went to long beach and on the boardwalk i was able to find this painting where it has two windows on it so i is situated right across from my bed so every morning i wake up and i look at these paintings and and the sunrise i um i think of hope allows me to have this fresh start a new beginning and it also makes me think of new opportunities makes me feel thankful and grateful because i have awakened to a new day basically these three paintings um it represents uh uh a meaningful part of my life and my journey on this on this earth and for those art lovers i'm sure you can relate so thank you for taking this little tour with me in my home in forest hills new york and um if you have any suggestions on other paintings or canvas that i should get that's inexpensive of course please let me know and uh thanks again for watching my vlog and if you'd like to see future vlogs please subscribe to my youtube channel take care
