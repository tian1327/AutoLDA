 good morning it is 8:30 I'm having my cup of coffee right now I have some styling homework to do before my styling class online starts at nine o'clock let's raise our quarantine cups to another day of quarantining happy Tuesday I just had my styling class I must say it's so bizarre so many of the things that made the style and class special and worthwhile have been cancelled because a lot of the classes were field trips and visits to showrooms and our professor had organized a project with hmm I'm not bashing my professor I think she's great I'm kind of just describing the situation of going from in-class classroom setting to an online quarantine a version of it I'm gonna message my boss and ask her what her priorities are how I can help her just so I can be organized and spend my time at home wisely I woke up so sore my stomach or my abs hurt my arms hurt my legs hurt but that's great I haven't felt a workout pain and so so long and I love I kind of love having a little bit of tricep pain I feel like I've done a good job when your abs hurt I feel like it's just awful do you have a little bit of tricep pain you're like oh but you're like oh I did a good job my outfit is the exact same thing I was wearing yesterday it's quarantine time we're not judging each other all right I have made another one of my orange goop drinks I intentionally didn't clean my dishes so I could spend a chunk of time today washing them all yes now 11:47 I just cooked up this little greasy breakfast I did the Apple I don't know apple something sausage from Trader Joe's I just had one so I was like I'm gonna cook it and then one egg the dishes are all done I'm just drying these here and I got to make myself another coffee I'm really really needing another one right now I don't know why I just have no real energy or motivation so coffee coming up it's me again I could put in some effort and look a little bit a little bit better but honestly I just I can't um it's 149 to be exact I have just been doing some work um not like work work because speaking of work work I think I just got fired boss who I love love her so much she's perfect best boss ever she said that basically the hours are gonna change for me just until we go back to the office I was upset at first just because I wish that that wasn't the case but like I think a lot of people a lot of people feel the exact same way right now I have enough money to pay my rent I have enough money and to eat so like I'm okay it's just one thing that I know was bringing me joy I love working I literally love to work like I am 100% a premature workaholic because even when I'm not doing work like my job that pays me I like to do YouTube stuff and YouTube I it's not an income source for me like I make like five dollars a month off YouTube it's not something that I actually generate a lot of money from as you can tell I don't get that many views I've had my youtube account for seven years now I've always had a job either working in restaurants or retail or babysitting or now an actual like big-girl job and I've always been in school so youtube has never been my number one priority because it never could have been I just literally didn't have the time that's why I've always done YouTube on the weekends when I could if I could enlist the help of other people I've always tried to do that since my chunk of time that is devoted to work like going to the office is now taken out I'll have a lot more time to devote my YouTube channel and that's why I'm excited to make use of this quarantine time and hopefully create good content that doesn't require buying new things and you know you know what I'm saying I hope this makes sense I'm now going into my TED talk anyways the second coffee is bringing a lot of joy into my soul hopefully things can look up from here but I think the biggest thing of the day was hearing that my hours are all cut because of what's happening and I won't be going like I won't have a job basically until we go back to the office which in New York who knows when that's gonna be it is now 2:30 I just changed into workout clothes so I can do an hour of I keep thinking pigeons or people and all the pigeons are just like at the corner of the roof that is next to me I'm gonna do at least an hour of a workout yesterday I did 20 minutes plus an extra five minutes but I did keep taking breaks during my workout yesterday I can doing another Pamela Wright workout video she has this whole playlist on her channel with beginner workouts and honestly I told you guys last video I'm so out of shape I need to do all the beginner things rolling out my yoga mat and if you're wondering my mat is a Basquiat painting it's by the brand rome pays off it's definitely a conversation piece people always ask me where this is prob so just so you know I'll link it down below if you are interested let's see how this goes I hope I don't die say okay wait    just try to an hour of a workout but I started feeling like I was dying I started feeling so nauseous I could only get through like 30 minutes and that 30 minutes was with like a couple of breaks that were in the video but I did get through a whole video and then I started a second video and I just started feeling so so so nauseous I think you have to get over feeling like you're dying and like vomiting because I can't work out if I literally feel like I'm gonna gag it got to the point where I went above the toilet and like basically felt like I was gonna throw up I didn't so I'm okay I just think I'm like really out of shape I gotta do it everyday but I'm gonna do 30 minutes for the rest of the week just so I can actually commit and feel accomplished and not like die and trying to do an hour and like feeling ill and discouraged you know I just got out of the shower I got another pajama set on so comfortable and playing some Oh see I have my butternut squash soup again this is the last of it I'm gonna eat this for my lunch also just gonna prepare some like recipes that I want to make throughout the rest of the week I'm almost running out of food just so I know what to pick up in terms of what I want to make and what groceries I need and then I'm waiting for my macroeconomics class to start it says I'm the only one in the room he said the class starts at 5:10 so just gonna wait for that I've just been doing some video editing for a super exciting video I have coming up but I thought it'd be funny to share here are some people enjoying their life pre coronavirus if you look on the corner of the screen we got that guy he's enjoying his best life is now at 7:55 I made the same thing for dinner I just substituted the figs for mozzarella cheese because I noticed that I had some mozzarella cheese and I love cheese so any excuse to eat it I will do it mood post quarantine is this its Luke from the OSI during this scene  I'm still watching The OC editing a video I have a mug of tea my lights are super dim and I'm eating some dark chocolate my absolute favorite good morning I just woke up it is currently the afternoon so I'm lying it's not the morning I decided to stay up until 4:00 last night because when you don't have obligations I think it's okay to sleep in force myself to be a morning person um I don't know if it's work all I did this morning was read an hour of the news I have the New York Times like daily briefing and I straight-up read every single article and the news is just not it's a stress source but I also want to be informed of one know what's happening so I did that for an hour and then my brother and I FaceTime for like 20 minutes and he was like make sure you wash your hands as if I don't I washed my hands before kovat I wouldn't wash my hands extra hard during covet update I'm on the couch now I finished my coffee and then I started getting anxious over certain things and like insecurities and stuff and I just started crying so happy quarantine um yeah that's like the worst part of this is like I don't know I'm like anxious and um I am on medication for it and I have some like self-esteem issues I guess and I just like sure you're getting really sad and like in my own head and like comparing and just like started crying and I hate doing that and I didn't really want to share it but I mean I just if someone else feels the same way like I don't know maybe me sharing might make you feel better I'm straight-up just gonna eat peanut butter banana and bread because they actually really really like that it's so basic but comforting and that's really all I want right now and I think I'm just gonna like chill I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself to like be productive every minute of the day and like I'm never like actually watching TV and just watching TV I'm just gonna like maybe watch some videos and then maybe you plan on some like actual content because like vlogs aren't actual content that preparing for and that always makes me happy to just like come up with ideas and video concepts and whatnot and what that entails and I've also been browsing Zara which is not something I'm allowed to be doing right now have an order on the way from them coming up reporting live from the couch I just a half a bag of peanuts lightly salted peanuts I love these so much it's 6:30 now I have my product development class this one is different than my other classes my other classes we've been doing a zoom like video call where we have to be on it this she's already pre-recorded videos and she's just monitoring like our activity on it and this class is so not the same and I'm just whining and so oh she's so cute she like got ready and pre-recorded all these videos I love her basically I'm gonna go to my product development class I'm literally having mac and cheese for dinner and I have no shame I cannot be bothered to cook anything so I just made this made this mac and cheese not healthy didn't work out today and I'm eating mac and cheese welcome to quarantine day 9 you guys I'm gonna call it a night it's only 7:30 but I just don't feel good um it's one of my sad days hey which I obviously wasn't accounting for and I don't want to bring anyone's like mood down or anything and I'm literally I'm looking at slides just doing some product development reading basically my class for now and I think I'm just gonna like figure out what to do from here on out as for the vlogs I will combine two days in one and still try and upload because I do enjoy it when I'm not feeling like I'm dying I'm literally not gonna do anything except for eat for the rest of the night and I doubt you really care to see that and I have really nothing to share so I will hopefully see you tomorrow and better spirits and I am I'm
