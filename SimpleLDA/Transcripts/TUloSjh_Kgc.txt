    yesterday I found out that my dad's house got broken into I had to come down to one of the windows of my car I just got a ride downtown but I have to walk the Penn Station to catch the train so I thought we could take a look around New York City a little bit get some footage and see what's happening in New York and it was an empty or not wow it's posing very photogenic bird Wow thanks for the footage you'll be seen by thousands it's all the time my whole life I'll be able to walk down Park Avenue like this holy crap nobody here at all completely empty seven economy honey I got the camera and the gas mask people look at me like I'm crazy you know Sykes I'm wearing this mask but you can still see I have a fat face but I have like fat cheeks nose around so far what I'm singing is it's pretty empty there's not a lot of people there are people out but it's nothing it's a shadow its former self there's really no activity no business nothing it's just a couple people jogging the buses are still running and a bus with no people the displays of the stores are still on but no one's inside there all shudder a lot of people are wearing masks but like down on their chin so where they're not really effective which I guess doesn't really matter cuz we're outside on the street there's so few people I doubt it's really a big risk I guess people are just wearing em when they go inside here's famous st. Patrick's Cathedral usually crawling with people looks like the doors are closed so if Tiffany looks like right now so my train is at Penn Station and to get there we got a pass through Times Square so I'm really curious to see what time spray looks like and all the movies where there's an apocalypse they always tell Times Square big empty I'm curious to see what it actually looks like I'm sure there's gonna be some people there just sixth Avenue okay this is crazy ante is you've never been to Times Square you know that around this point is where it starts getting hard to move no it's like what 20 people all the seats have been locked down it even got a security guard out there some people from the city this photographers photographers and videographers tourists have been replaced by pandemic photographers let me get double he's still here make it tough on his wearing a bandana nothing stops this guy it's like a dream there you go there that newscaster though the road and then worked out you have to leave I'm trying to get a good shot to middle the street for this kind of fake like the streets are empty but they're not that heavy I think a lot of these gases are gonna do that but look at that he was trying to do it a little bit soon right now but there are cars so it's not like it's completely you know the complete goes down this is what I did it usually it's pretty empty though well the thumbnail today say thanks sir what's amazing in that sense fear right now full of idiots like me we're just here to film and take video I take face shows there's like a photo shoot behind me I don't you can see battalion newscasters photographers models everyone is thinking this is like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity I get it it really is unique I mean it's it's never gonna be like this like this is so bizarre as a New Yorker I feel like you you think about this aligning what if the yard was empty and then it's empty lexis under substantive circumstances but that was a trip that was experience for sure welcome to Times Square like that unreal as Clarke seems to be doing just fine people are enjoying the nice weather this is the first public seating area I've seen that was like fun stuff the tables are more spun out and there are fewer of them maybe that's it nice spot but enough I guess this is a social distancing line or something everyone six feet apart what are they waiting for well we need for CVS Pharmacy you know waiting lines to get into the pharmacy here's a weird little thing that's happening I know how that you footage of this for obvious reasons but basically there's a lot more criminal activity happening a little bit more blatant than I've ever seen it other people I talked to who have been out here they kind of have said similar things it just feels a little bit seedy er this is the first time I've ever been to the Shake Shack in Madison Square Park without a line can't keep the mask on forever I guess my man's gotta eat his Shack burgers it's been like 10 years as I've had Shake Shack at the original Shake Shack I'm gonna enjoy this sitting here eating Shake Shack you almost forget that during the middle of the epicenter of a pandemic you got Chinese newspapers on the street I never noticed before I don't know how long it's just here it's all propaganda look at this gated workers helping to keep the country safe give me a break all right we took over I'm headed back back to safety I hope I don't get as many hate comments on this Corona blog as I have in the past think of it a little bit more a little more conscientious let's still taking advantage of trending topics hope you guys have joined someone this was an experience to see you back at safety I guess
