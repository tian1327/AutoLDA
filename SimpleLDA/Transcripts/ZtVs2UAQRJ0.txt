 my friends I forgot had a blog I forgot how to do anything functioning because of how long we've been in the house but we are slowly but surely ish starting to try to get back to normalcy don't think that's happening honestly in New York City but we're trying somewhat trying to expose ourselves to our friends because they've also all been quarantined for three months we've just been trying to take baby steps into just life becoming somewhat normal again god I'm like unloading a lot on you guys but this has just been my anxieties we Jordan and I are going to go drive to the city today we haven't been there since the last time that I've logged the city which was like two months ago when I put out the vlog of what New York City looks like right now Quorra talk over let's go to the car and start our commute     hi I'm sweating we're on 96th Street by Central Park we forgot well I didn't forget but I kind of forgot that Jordans car doesn't have air god whatever we're by Central Park and off some shade to see where we want to go into the park because Central Park is literally ginormous oh uh it seems like there's more people out than the last time we came to the city and blogged which was the only other time during poor but again we're from here so it's not like we're on a road trip like New York steady baby like no I just want to see my City shot bro oh the Mets right here maybe we should he's a poet my arm hurts from holding you guys about bye so we may or may not have found the spot don't think that it's not but I we gave up on caring when Verona started moral of the story back to where we thought we parked in a spot where everyone else was parked nobody has tickets on their cars technically like we're not in the allotted time to park there but nobody else on the block is but also nobody else on the block has tickets and a woman came out from one of the apartments like the nice ones and she's like I've been parked here since yesterday I haven't gotten a ticket see you're fine like don't take my word but you're fine so I was like we're fine cause you could tell that we're like downtown kids because we never go pet like Midtown and once we're up here we're like oh my god it's so pretty everything's so nice because like they don't have stuff like this downtown looking in front of all the cute little buildings to try to see where I could make a picture    so we made it to the park for fresh air and it gets low-key you can't I wish I had contact oh you can't see well if we're not next to people I don't think that we have to wear it it's just I don't know obviously I'm wearing the masks like everywhere but in the park at least on Staten Island we haven't been wearing the masks because like you're on the park and you're you are at the beach and you're not next to anybody but obviously Central Park is way more busy than a lot of people aren't well because if you're quarantined together and you're just sitting on a towel like if we're just walking in the park and no one's like no one's behind us no one's in front of us right now we're in an outdoor space I don't know - two guys what have you guys been doing I just like update family alone like we're spinning we can see Central Park's crazy because like there's it's so big and there's so many different parts I want to get to that part to show Jordan with like the fountain and whatever I know but like we haven't been there together what time is it 1:00            crisis averted spider almost on my sandwich we couldn't avoid the hungry squirrel though wait stop that's traumatizing bro he wants our food the city squirrels are a different breed hmm do we like JumpShip the city seems a little different from the last time we were here but also when it definitely we're in a different neighborhood  how come everything  five News we're back in the car and we don't have a ticket so I was really nice walk in the park like last time we came here people weren't even looking at each other this time at least people are like yelling from a distance like talking to each other so it seems a little more New York               I'm so excited because Tiger Sugar opened we came to Chinatown thinking that maybe everything was still gonna be a little bit closed like the last time we came here you guys saw everything it was desolate like honestly it looks like a zombie apocalypse I'm not saying that just to be funny I know I don't I'm sorry no no yeah wow that was spooky I hate when men approached the car when I'm sitting in a car alone stop I'm in a little tiny dress it's Corona season I'm sweating it's literally 80 degrees in New York City Jordans inside getting us our Tiger sugar drinks because all not all but some of the restaurants and drink places in Chinatown are open so we're like hell yeah let's get our fave stuff and I walked back to the car because we didn't pay the meter and I'm like I'll go sit in the car because we didn't pay the meter let's itting here with the door wide open like are you gonna jump in are you gonna do something weird like I'm literally like just like sit here holding the keys so I could try to do a nice simple test I'm like I'll Jordan I'll go sit in the car so you could wait here and get our drink so you don't have to sit in the hot car it's like always it's like the one second I have to myself with Jordan you know away it's like men have to just be the kind of scary like he probably didn't mean for it to be in any way but like when you walk closer and closer to me especially when it's Corona and we're all wearing masks and let's just I'm sweating anyway that was annoying but we're getting Tiger sugar which is Bava but it's not team it's basically brown sugar milk with the tapioca pearls delicious I'm excited but anyway what I really want to talk about is the fact that Chinatown is starting to get a little more up and running which is really good did Jordan get lost oh I see him those perfect timing  so anyway I just felt ordinate on the on the on the man story and he's like this happened all in 10 minutes of me not being here I also have my own story what's your story man Wow while I was walking back I watched a little kitten run across the street oh that's your story yeah I was it it's very wholesome and then there was one guy you're just like I guess it was this kitten another guy try to grab it oh no the thing we ended up just ordering online by Chloe which is this vegan fast-food place I'm just waiting a few minutes and then we'll probably pull up right in front of it because it's literally a few blocks in front of us after this we're gonna go home
