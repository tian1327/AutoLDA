 I'm just gonna like I'm so scared okay that is hot one load of laundry that dirty so much to do Oh welcome back to my youtube channel I have come to a breaking point of quarantine and for those of you who live in New York City you can share my pain I have to do laundry in New York City you have to go to a laundromat to do laundry near my apartment there's a really really nice Chinese family that owns the laundromat down the block and they do drop-off services so I've been doing drop-off services for the past two years recently they have stopped doing drop-offs so you can only do your own laundry I could do that but I'm a little worried about touching all of the machines and sharing the space with other people and I don't know like I really feel like it's better for my mental health and my newly founded germ phobia to just do laundry by hand growing up my family didn't have a machine so I was able to watch my mom's doing laundry by hand so I think I got it that's why I'm gonna attempt to do today and we'll see how it goes cuz honestly I have no idea how this is gonna turn out okay let's get started  okay so I'm lucky for me I've been quarantined so I haven't worn like jeans I've only one really really soft stuff so like sweatpants and t-shirts and some underwear I've been free balling a little bit some towels some sweat shirts a lot of like sweat shorts I really like those which is good for me because I have tiny wrists have lady hands I feel like it's pretty easy to do alright let's get into the bathroom welcome to my bathroom we are getting ready to do laundry let's see I have some detergent I didn't buy a big one because who knows this could go really really wrong so I don't want to like buy the whole day and commit to it you know so I have that I have a little brush that I'm gonna use to like scrub the clothes I don't have any clothes but I don't think I think it's fine I think it's fine and yeah my laundry here I've seen some people doing laundry by just putting clothes in the tub and they just like step on it my mom never did that when it was a kid so I don't think that's something that you should do and I don't think like if you just stepping on clothes I don't think it's gonna get anything clean right I do recommend this setup I'm about to show you right now so behind the curtain oh so what I have here is I have two buckets one is gonna be for soapy water and one is gonna be for non soapy water regular water so the idea is basically just watching clothes and use soapy water and you rinse it in your clean water and then you just squeeze it dry and hang it up to dry so that's what I'm gonna be doing laundry by hand okay then you turn on the water water buckets are being filled I am going to sort out my laundry and check to see if I have any laundry money laying around no not this one I see come on come on all right no money this time okay so the first bucket is full and now we're gonna fit the second bucket and then we should be ready to go okay so now the two buckets are filled with water around the same amount I'm gonna put one load of detergent ooh  maybe one more I don't know this is soapy enough no I'm just gonna like good there we go okay so the soapy water is done okay I'm just gonna put in sure I'm so scared okay and then I remember my mom just do this oh god my feet are killing me so when you're done scrubbing your shirt you just give it a good squeeze like that and then you just drop it into the clean bucket  like that okay and then now I'm gonna do it for the rest of the clothes  so remember the brush that I brought with me this thing and then I bring a cutting board so you can like drop your clothes on the cutting board and you can use the brush do this if you want to I honestly don't know how clean this makes it oh my back is killing me oh my fans are gonna be a pain in the ass one utility later so much to do this is hard work I don't know how my mom did this cuz this my back is killing me just like oh Jesus oh look at my barber sauce on the camera my clothes are not very dirty because I've only been in the house and I haven't really gotten anywhere except for you know taking a walk or going through the grocery stores so I think this is clean enough for me but if you like if you run around in like mud or you play paintball you get paint all over your clothes I don't think this is enough for that so for that you need to like search for something else okay but I feel closely where daily in the house during quarantine I really believe this is enough so it's very likely to I'll be moving in two weeks and the new apartment has washer and dryer in the unit so finger crossed that happens so I only need to do this once you can see this is the clean bucket this is the dirty bucket which you can see is so Brown and dirty we are going to dump out this water and we're going to move this over here or whenever we fill this with clean water and then we're gonna do like a semi scrub and squeeze and move from this over there let's get to work it's one load of laundry that dirty Jesus it's kind of like this destiny beautiful you know the moment late they'll know water is filled now I need to rinse this you can already tell like the waters getting a little bit dirty too so you do this a few times until the water is clean enough we're just gonna do this to the best of our ability  that is hot oh that is like burning hot we had to deal with that later but okay fun story for you guys back in the day in my home country people would bring close to the river and they would lay their clothes on large chunks of rocks and they would use a steak or something to like slam their clothes on the raft cleaner before they hang them up to dry isn't that so interesting so as you can see the water is dirty de ghin so I decided to switch up the method for this last round of rinsing I'm gonna take each piece one by one rinse it under the water and squeeze it dry and then put them in an empty bucket the key is to make sure it's really dry so it dries faster when you hang it up I know it seems a little tedious but at this point it seems like it's a lot less work than doing the whole thing with the two buckets all over again my god I'm almost done that is as dry as I can get this goddamn towel and with that we are done with our batch in hindsight I should really get close because I get like major blisters on my hands I don't I will show you this gross but ouch mmm okay let's hang these bad boys up and call it a day  okay oh okay so now we have to hang the clothes and I don't have the best solution for this this is like a frame for a background paper 19 1/2 of filming and they have a ton of hangers it's not the most reliable system so we're gonna see I know we're not done yet but seeing the clothes being hung up makes this whole thing feel really humbling and rewarding we had a few hiccups but we powered through and we're almost done  we are experiencing some technical difficulties please stand by that's pretty good so all of the clothes have been hung up my apartment doesn't get the most Sun so I think it's gonna take a little longer than usual maybe like a day or two who knows so I'm just gonna let them dry and like open the window and turn on the fan or whatever and when they are done drying I might have to iron some of them because it's a little wrinkly then usually when you drop it off um so I might have to iron some of them but for the most part I can just like fold and put away it took me a little bit longer than I expected because I didn't have the best like process in the beginning but now I know what I need to do if I have to do this again I think I can get it done faster you know not bad not bad for the first time doing laundry by hand I feel like it's really really important for all of us to get in touch with our history and learn how to do things before we get all these fancy machines you know I'm saying like so like today I learned how to do laundry by hand great maybe tomorrow I'll learn how to make rice without a rice cooker and then maybe the next day I won't have to start a fire from woods or something I don't know yeah let's not do that it's like 11:00 p.m. on a Sunday night so I should probably wrap this up clean up and get ready for bed because I have work tomorrow yeah you know but yeah thank you guys for watching if you have a better way of doing all of this stuff let me know in comment section because I might have to do this again at some point and if you haven't yet make sure you subscribe to my channel and um yes I will see you in the next video bye you
