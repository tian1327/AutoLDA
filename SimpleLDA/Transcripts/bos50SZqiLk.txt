 hi guys welcome back to the vlogs  so today is Monday it is the start of the week I always try to be very productive on Monday it's always trying to get up early to get my day started because a good Monday it means you're gonna have a good week but I'm gonna be honest with you guys today it was kind of a rough day for me we're kind of like a rough morning for me I'm just gonna be honest with you guys because obviously this whole coronavirus is happening and everyone's going through tough times right now it can be really difficult to stay positive in some moments and I feel like this morning was one of them for me I just like read the news and heard some news from family and friends of people being affected and it's just like coming closer to home I guess you could say everyday and it's just was a hard morning for me to kind of it's a hard pill to swallow honestly just like thinking of the unknown so I'm just letting you guys know that so you know that you guys are not alone this thing is scary and confusing and stressful but we have to stay positive that is what we got to do there's no point in stressing with the unknown so all you can do is be positive and do your part wash your hands stay home if you can social distancing is so important you guys that this is now day 11 for me in isolation and it has been honestly pretty challenging I'm not gonna lie like not leaving your house not seeing your family I feel like for the first week it was just not really a big deal but now that it's becoming over a weekend and it's becoming just like a longer situation than I anticipated it's just becoming a little bit heavier and harder to do so anyways that is just the way I was feeling this morning but I'm going to now get back to work I kind of took the morning off to at FaceTime some family some friends and just kind of feel better about the situation I recommend you guys to do that pick up the phone we're so lucky that technology is such a thing right now in a 20/20 so you can pick up your phone any time FaceTime a friend FaceTime family if you feeling lonely or they'll always be there to pick you up so and also guys feel free to message me if you guys are feeling down I'm more than happy to chat with you guys over DMS I'm always happy to do that but anyways that's just how I'm feeling this morning and I just wanted to let you guys know so that you guys know that you are not alone in this we are all going through and the same thing but anyways like I said it is Monday and I'm going to do my best to get back to work get back to regular scheduled programming obviously I still have work to do like everybody else so I'm going to take my laptop and do some work in my bed this morning just to kind of give myself a little bit of a chill morning I just actually did laundry as you can see we have a nice new fresh bed here so I just felt like this morning I wanted to kind of refresh give myself a nice clean bed for Steven and I to have like a fresh week I guess you could say it always feels good to have like fresh sheets anyways so I did that this morning I made myself a really good breakfast and now we're gonna get to work  hey guys it's a little bit later in the day and I'm currently watching Justin Bieber live doing like a live concert on Instagram live and I'm literally sitting here in bed like crying and dying I'm just dying I'm literally singing along to the song I'm dying you guys I think it's so cool that all these artists are doing like IG lives and doing like live concerts for people in quarantine it's like the sweetest thing ever I would look at cry right now okay I'm fine I'm gonna go back to watching this now   hey you guys can you see me well there's probably the better lighting right here we're currently no I don't if you can see here I'll do it I don't know if you can tell but um we are currently in my igloo and you guys are all chatting and hanging out so everything this is in the vlog oh we're literally just all hanging in my igloo and we're having a meet-up a twenty20 quarantine meetup so this is what a meet-up looks like in 2020 since coronavirus is a thing right now so I think there's literally like 20 of us in my igloo just hanging out it's amazing to say the least and this was such a spur in the moment thing I really didn't think you guys were gonna come on but it's amazing how many of you guys have Club Penguin it counts because I haven't been on this thing in like 10 years so I just had to document this on the vlog because this is absolutely amazing and she look to you guys you're the real ones okay wait I'm gonna say everyone say hi to the blog everyone say hi to the blog oh my god I'm dead oh my god I can't this is hilarious even they're all saying hi also you know this is like so lit I can't even deal good morning you guys it is obviously the next morning and it means to even just woke up and we had our morning coffee as we do every morning and then now we're gonna go and clean the kitchen but I had an idea that we're going to productive situation idea that we're gonna set a timer for 15 minutes or 20 minutes I don't know and put on like our favorite artists we'll put on like Frank Ocean or like Daniel Caesar or something like chill and try to clean up the entire kitchen spotless clean in 15 to 20 minutes so wish us luck we're gonna go do that and then I'm gonna get on with my day but we can't do anything until the house is like clean and spotless because I can't work in like a cluttered environment even if it's like a couple plates like I need to I need to clean it but honestly right now the kitchen needs a clean and I don't know about you guys but if you guys live alone or live in an apartment with your boyfriend your roommates whatever I don't know about you guys but what I've learned about living alone is that you're always cleaning like you're never not cleaning I feel like once the house or the apartment is clean it gets messed up in like an hour so I don't know if it's just us or is that like a normal thing that happens when you live alone let me know because I would love to know that I'm not alone in this because I feel like we're just always cleaning but anyways speaking of that we got to go get to work and hopefully we'll be done in 20 minutes   okay guys and just like that we have cleaned the kitchen I lit one of my favorite candles you guys know this brand because I did my French kiss candle with them model of the brand but I'm lighting currently her one that's called cozy so I lit a candle it's nice and clean in here and it feels so much better okay it has clearly been a little bit since I last picked up the camera but this morning we just like cleaned out the kitchen and like I said to you guys but that we like got into a cleaning groove and we ended up cleaning these higher apartment and I don't think I showed you guys but we had like I think 20 boxes from like packages and just like moving and stuff that we needed to break down and stuff in the apartment they were just like taking up the entire hallway I don't even think I got on camera but it was just like such a clutter mess and we needed to get rid of it so we literally spent the entire day like deep cleaning everything and reorganizing we put a ton of stuff into storage because a lot of stuff was just like hanging around the apartment and then we also broke down like I said like I literally think 20 to 25 boxes and went down into the recycling to go do all of that kind of stuff so I thought I'd give you guys a little update on my office and Stephens done and then we also have the bedroom nothing much is really changing here but I thought I'd give you guys a little update because we truly didn't spend the entire day getting down and dirty in this apartment so hold on so the living room is obviously still the same not much has changed but much cleaner we vacuumed obviously in the bedroom here again not much has changed Pepa is still sleeping on the bed but we did tidy it up everything is organized bathroom organized but the main thing we did was the office and Stevens den so I'm currently just getting some work done and also I'm doing an order on Amazon so I'll show you guys in a sec what I'm ordering but I was just kind of this my little workstation right now but anyways so when you walk down at this hallway we have a few things here from Ikea that we still have to return so I just have like a little pile here that I need to go back to I get to return it so that is gonna stay there for now and then I've never actually showed you guys or I haven't show you guys in a while in the vlog but this is our den so our apartment is a two bedroom plus a den it's just like glass doors that like slide open but this is going to be Stephens mancave so clearly as you can see he has brought his xbox here he's gonna be setting that up we just are gonna be ordering some controllers and stuff for him and a TV so this place is now cleared out we had all these boxes here and stuff but now if there's room for him to like put seats and everything and then obviously in my office you guys have seen it we've done made some good progress in here but we obviously still have some boxes from the move that I just haven't unboxed or anything just like random stuff like sunglasses and like miscellaneous stuff I have a bin of shoes that I'm going to be giving away or selling or something because I just don't have room for them and I don't wear them anymore and then obviously there's the shoe wall with all of the shoes that I wear most of the time and then I ended up putting my mirror over here because I really love this mirror and you guys always ask about it it's actually my grandma's vintage mirror that she gifted to me so I wanted to bring it to this apartment and I thought it would be good to put in this corner for like mere selfies and stories and so I got just to have like the good lighting on it so that's why I put it in this corner so that it looked cute with like the plain white wall on the back anyways and then I also have some packages here just for some collabs that are coming up but stuff to unpackage that and then I have my clothing rack here which you guys know I just kind of keep all of the clothing that I have to shoot and everything it's just kind of like neutral colors right now with a bunch of random stuff on it and then if you go over here so okay this is a situation happening here but okay so this is a situation so my grandma also gave me this when I went to fashion school and it's like this vintage what would you call it like it's like a mannequin but anyways I didn't want to get rid of it because it was a nice gift from my grandma so Steven had a good idea to dress it up into something and keep it on display but I don't think I'm gonna be doing this dress.i we just kind of played around with it to see what it would look like but I do like the idea of having a little thing here but I think it's gonna be something more neutral and something a little bit more basic but Steven was playing around with the necklaces and he wanted to put on some gold ones and stuff so he's walking by Stevens idea yeah so he was playing around with the mannequin and dressing her today but anyways that's gonna be changed for sure and then obviously in my closet over here this is the update we ended up putting up all my designer boxes up here which I store all my dust bags in and then I have some bags up here which I need to get some bag dividers and then my hats and then obviously I have all my clothing that's just like leftover stuff from my closet and then I'm also gonna have to get some type of shelving or something for all of these shoes because these are all the extra shoes that I still want to keep but just I don't have that room on it on my shoe shelf so again we are making some progress here I still have to get some furniture in here obviously to store everything and then for my actual computer in office so I'm thinking of putting a table or desk right here and I'm also gonna get myself a MacBook like desktop so I can properly work here with like a chair and everything and then I can actually use this as an office because as of right now it's literally just like a room with clothes in it and I like hate that feeling of not having like a productive space feel like I really just want to start getting work done in here which obviously that makes sense but anyways a lot of work to do in here still but super fun I love decorating I think it's super fun to play around and like look online and find some cool furniture and stuff so it's just the price you got to pay when you move out and don't have any furniture to bring with you we would literally have to start from scratch so anyways that is the update on that so yeah that is what we did all day it was very much a productive day now I have to do a load of laundry and honestly yeah I know what time it's 5:30 time flies when you're busy and I'm so sorry I didn't flog anything I honestly didn't story I don't run to my phone all day it's just one of those days where you just gotta get done and put everything else aside okay also I'm about to place an order on Amazon so I thought I'd show you guys what I'm getting because I find it so interesting I did a haul in my last vlog I don't know I just find it so interesting what people get on Amazon because I'm such an Amazon freak i order off of it like every day but anyway so the first thing is Clippers and like a nail kit because obviously we are self isolating and are not planning to go to a manicure or salon any time soon so we're gonna try to do it ourselves from now on we just just don't have that so it's kind of a necessity I guess this is the shoe rack that I'm gonna be getting for my office it's nothing fancy but I just need like shoe storage to create some just to kind of avoid clutter and stuff in my office closet so got that we've got an Xbox one wireless controller because obvious reasons for Stevens mancave I also got myself some no crease hair clips for when I'm styling my hair I'm doing my makeup I feel like it's just like something every girl needs in their beauty closet and then we're getting some sunlight laundry detergent super fun adulting and then I'm also getting my Anastasia Beverly Hills brow definer because I am running low and I definitely need that we also are getting a blender so I'm getting the Ninja Blender I heard it's good so we're doing that and then we're also getting some scotch tape so super random order but that's Amazon for you so what's on the what's on the menu tonight babe that's stunning that's some gourmet stuff renewed that's okay you can make this is this is so embarrassing people think we're good at we've been cooking I swear we really have yeah we aren't bad but yeah you did honestly though I'm craving a nice I can't wait right now I'm excited I'm excited for this tonight's the night for a nanny's night you want to tell the viewers what you're doing to make a gourmet yeah so basically I just put a bunch of this in it cheese yeah it is so it's like I don't even have to do it you can do any choice though yeah I put Gouda and Monterey Jack okay like ten pieces in and then now look at it stunning Wow he's like probably so cute that's fine and then you guys I'm gonna add some secret sauce some everything okay I don't know if I can do this by myself um some everything but the bagel I literally put it on everything I'm not even exaggerating so I don't know if this is weird and you guys are gonna find this as weird Stephen thinks I'm weird but um I think it looks so I think if not look so good it tastes so good you guys with your annie's did you guys ever go like to a friend's house in elementary school and then their mom makes you like Cavey and then they your friend what you thought was your friend quits like I'd love to catch up you guys comment below if you guys were the kid who had ketchup in your pasta or like weird things in your pasta because I definitely was and Stephen absolutely wasn't I put ketchup in my in my pastor I preferred tomato sauce okay well your bougie I was I was cheap so anyways bone Appetit  all right so we just finished dinner a little bit ago and I realized that the Sun was actually peeping through the clouds and it was actually very nice out so I think we're gonna shoot a quick little sunset photo on the balcony or something so I'm just like quickly doing my hair and makeup like 5-minute hair and makeup yeah sometimes just like a spur in the moment I was literally just talking about how I haven't shot in a little bit because the weather's been so bad and I prefer to just like not shoot and not sure I know it's probably not gonna turn out very well if I do Shoop and it's like raining in gross out so I try to just like shoot whenever the weather's nice and seems to be turning good today so we're gonna shoot a quick pic okay I think I think that is good enough I think you oh I should put on earrings these are my favourite hoops like of all time right now there by Adina's Jules I'll link them down below if they're still available but they're like literally my favorite earrings of all time I wear them all day every day it's just almost a staple of my wardrobe they're like the perfect size hoop they're so like Halley Bieber vibes I don't know something see it just like makes it out be cuter anyways you go shoot a picnic I think this is about morning I'll show you guys I was cleaning out my closet as you guys know today and I refined my balloon see laga sweater that i bought like two three years ago for Fashion Week and I haven't worn it in a really long time so bringing it back out for the photo today that'd be cute to style it again cuz obviously it's an expensive piece so you want to get as much wear out of it as possible I'm gonna change into that and then we'll figure out where we're gonna shoot okay that was a little easy fast is five minutes of me getting ready this was so spur in the moment I was not planning on shooting today but I just did my everyday little sleek bun it literally took me under five minutes put on some fun hoops and I'm just gonna wear the sweater with no pants as a little dress and that's look I might wear sunglasses or something since we're shooting on the balcony but I don't know we'll see how this goes this was like so whisper in the moment thing but then I take you guys along because this is sometimes what happens that the Sun comes out you get some content okay guys now I'm thinking I should wear this white hoodie I know what do you think thinking like my YSL Sunny's with this hoodie would be really cute like on the balcony but also I haven't worn this in like a year so what do you guys think also if I came to join Pip out what do you think okay I feel like this is cuter right yes my son Yvonne this is something I would wear all the time so okay this is the vibe and this is coming out okay so now we're having our movie night that I told you about and this is here already she's ready to go she's doing her first in care routine she's doing her skincare routine we just took all of our makeup off got our pajamas okay what I was wearing before because it's comfortable and we're

stunning okay good morning guys okay so today is what David Steve no it's Wednesday it's a Wednesday honestly quarantine has me not knowing what date is but anyway say it's Wednesday and today I decided I'm going to shower first thing in the morning and put a little makeup on because I feel like the past two days I've been kind of just not wearing makeup and obviously I'm still in like sweat suits and stuff but I feel like it's really important to every now and then a little make fun make yourself feel a little bit normal it can be hard when you're working from home to like get into like a bad routine if you don't like shower do your hair act like you would normally add a job obviously I've always been working from home so like it's not like I came from a corporate job to working at home so it's not like that crazy of a transition for me but I feel like since like the mindset is quarantine I've kind of like kind of put myself into like a little bit of an off routine and I feel like I need to get back on my normal scheduling so yeah anyways today I just decided to give myself a little blowout to make myself feel good put a little makeup on put on one of my favorite sweaters fresh out of the laundry just you know things where you know it's gonna be a good day I just as you saw did my bed I always like to make the bed it's very important Stephen gist was such a kind sweet angel and did all the dishes right Steve you are speeding dollars I did notice and he just cleaned all the dishes so the kitchen is clean and we're just ready to tackle on a new day I had my morning coffee as well as you guys saw I had a little FaceTime call with knits it's always good to chat with the girls in the morning and get this all in a good mood yeah anyways I'm going to now get to work on my computer and start my day okay so this is my current setup at home like you might know I do not have an office desk yet and I still have to get one I just can't really decide what's gonna fit in the space the best and like really what we're doing it's so hard to furnish an apartment you guys like I can't even stress that enough but anyways as of right now I'm working on our kitchen island and this is kind of my designated workspace for right now and yeah I'm just gonna be working here for maybe the next hour or two answering emails I'm doing more like admin work today and then also the sun's out today so I think I might probably shoot a photo like I did yesterday so yeah that is my plan for the next few hours and then I think we're gonna make some lunch and take a lunch break I also think that's really important when you're working from home to take like a proper lunch break I feel like needs to be there really bad at that we don't take proper lunch breaks we just like eat while we're working and it's really good to like put your electronics aside and just like fully enjoy your lunch and do that so we're gonna do that today Stephens also having a little work day as well and yeah  okay so it has been a little bit now and I'm going to make Steven and I breakfast slush lunch I guess you could say it is our famous breakfast sandwich and you guys we have nailed this down it is so freakin good so I thought that I would do it on the vlog so you guys can't get our little recipe and try it at home because it was so easy so good really healthy it's healthy right yeah really healthy and it's super filling and it's taste delicious so we're gonna make it today on the blog oh you can either do like a full-on sandwich with bread on both sides or you could just make like you would make avocado toast and just have it on that but I'm gonna make us sandwiches because this is kind of our lunch as well and I want it to be a little bit more filling and you're also gonna need some avocados so I'm going to cut us up an avocado and then you're also going to need eggs so you're gonna need two eggs because you are going to fry those in come on sandwich you're also going to need everything with the bagel and if you don't have everything with the bagel then you can use just like salt and pepper and stuff but definitely recommend to get that and then you're also gonna need sweet chili sauce which again if you don't have this you can use sriracha sauce or you don't even need to I guess you did but it definitely makes the sandwich a lot better so I use this friend from Costco it's just the Thai Kitchen sweet red chili and then you're also going to need some mayonnaise so again if you're brilliant you can use your alternatives and you we only need to use all the ingredients and like switching out for what you prefer but these are the three ingredients I use I just use this one from Whole Foods Organic mayonnaise and then I use everything but the bagel obviously from Trader Joe's and then the Thai sweet chili by the way don't mind our clean dishes here we have to put them away but anyways whatever so you turn on the stove at like max heat and I'm just gonna put like a chunk of butter into it just put a piece of butter on there and then I have my two eggs ready to go and then I'm gonna go in here and get a spatula and I'm just gonna let that melt I'm gonna toast the bread well heat up the pan so while the bread is being toasted I'm gonna cut our avocado I really hope this avocado is good because it's like very very ripe so I don't know moment of truth you guys moment of truth you guys mmm that's not the cutest avocado but Stephen is that still good to eat I'm gonna try the other avocado yeah hopefully this one's a bit better depakote oh oh this one's good okay we got a winner Stephen we got a winner stunning okay so while the pan is still heating up I'm just going to cut through my avocado like this and then I'm literally just gonna like scoop out the avocado onto the bread once the bread is toasted so I'm pretty much just going to put some mayonnaise on that on the base of it and then I'm just gonna spread it out right up there and then now this should be ready to go so I'm going to no fried eggs you guys look how stunning these eggs are hold on Wow kind of the perfect eggs I really hope I can flip them okay so now the eggs are almost done I'm just gonna keep it close by but now I'm gonna do the garnishes on the avocado so the first one we're gonna do I love how I call it a garnish because it's literally everything that the bagel so I'm just gonna sprinkle everything but the bagel on the avocado like so okay and then now that the eggs are ready I'm going to put em on the sandwich okay and then now for the final touches I'm going to add the secret ingredient and that is the sweet chili sauce I feel like that just like makes the sandwich it's so good you guys I'll show you guys how I do that okay so this is what they look like right now and what I'm gonna do is just pretty much lightly lightly put some that was a little bit not it so late it's fine but lightly put the chili sauce over the sandwich like that and then I'm going to take the sandwich huh and flip it over and I'm just going to do that to the other one yes okay so that is the ultimate stunning queen breakfast sandwich you guys it is so good like I said there's just mayo chili sauce avocado an egg it's like so easy open everything but the bagel and then you just put in sandwich with toasted bread and it's warm it's stunning it's so good you guys chefs kiss okay guys I just thought in a pinch of trauma one of my favorite friends ever I work with Louisa aroma all the time and I'm always ordering stuff from their website and my most recent just arrived so I thought we'd do a lot unboxing here on the blog okay so the first thing is that I got are kind of random but I ended up getting some Balenciaga socks and I think they're so cute I've been wanting to get my socks for a while now and I just think they're really cute they're literally just like white basic socks but they're really fun fun style I think they'd be really cute just especially because we're in quarantine now so might as well invest in some cute socks and my right ladies said it about those the next thing that I got is actually by Gucci also by the way my laundry is going so that's your craft that is we have the dust bag so cute anyway so this is what I ended up getting this little clip look at it a little clip anyways I'm obsessed with it and I think I'll wear it a ton okay and then the last and final I don't know that I got I'm not very excited about this because I actually don't own anything from Bottega Veneta and they ended up finally getting one of my favorite heels buy them is so pretty you guys I'm obsessed like I can't even I wanted these for so long they're so cute there's a square toe strapping heel and I own honestly nothing like this and like I said I own nothing from Bottega so I think it is so fun that I finally get to start my little collection with them there's so cute so yeah those are the three things that I picked out and I hope you guys enjoyed my little unboxing okay so obviously it's a little bit later in the evening it's now 7:30 and the Sun is setting I wanted to show you guys the sunset here it's so beautiful it's literally my favorite part of this apartment and one of the reasons why we got it is because of the windows and how much light gets let in don't mind this mirror I was doing some photos earlier but the sunset here is just unreal and it makes me so happy sunsets truly made me so happy and I just sit here and watch the Sun go down because I keep missing it like I hate not watching it it's like the most beautiful thing ever stunning but anyways as I finished watching the sunset I just wanted to let you guys know I mean Steven are venturing out to Costco tonight because we are running out of groceries we are running low and yeah we got to stuck up so we haven't ventured out to groceries in a while because obviously you guys know we've been self isolating and yeah it's just time to go for like an hour maybe less than that and oh no Peppa no Peppa no Pippa no no no no no she was gonna knock down the freakin mirror but anyways as I was saying we are going to Costco we're running a low and we need a venture out for like maybe less than an hour just gonna quickly drive down there and go pick up groceries but I thought I'd take you guys with us because Costco can be kind of crazy during this whole coronavirus and like Cove in 1900 that I bring you guys along document how it is I don't have to be busy I don't have to be quiet but we'll see how it goes but to get the necessities and maybe I'll do like a grocery haul for you guys and stuff so anyways we need a head Steven are you ready to go okay okay so we just got back obviously from the grocery store but I just wanted to disclaim quickly obviously because we're wearing masks and it can be I know like somewhat controversial whether you should wear masks or not and we are fully aware that hospitals are running low on masks and I have been trying to share as much as I can on social media to help stock up masks um in hospitals and stuff around me in my community at least but I just wanted to disclaim that we had these masks prior to all of this and the reason why we're wearing them is not because we don't want to get sick it's because we don't want to give the sickness to anyone in case we do have it since we are young we technically could have the virus and not even know it we were in the states pretty recently when this whole thing happened we also live in an apartment building where we see people in the elevator and arts to other people somewhat in our elevator and stuff so we just don't want to give it to anyone who's elderly who's shopping around us or could be at risk because obviously that would not be good so that's why we're wearing the masks I just wanted to clarify that because I know it can be controversial but anyways that is the only reason why and we only have two one each we didn't go out like crazy people and stock up on like 50 each anyways disclaimer but yeah we'll be anyways we're gonna now bring up all these freaking groceries up are freaking it's you guys it's the worst bring up groceries in an apartment I don't know about you guys if you guys live in an apartment yeah is the worst we buy like the heaviest we suffer I don't know why but we always have the most groceries like the kombucha and the chicken broth no I can't like all that stuff is so heavy oh we have to go do that but we'll see you guys upstairs just like just like  so I'm not gonna be sharing the recipe here we're making Greek salad stunning Queen Greek salad and we're also making chicken I mean it's already made we just got like a roasted chicken and we're just making some fresh green salad I mean Greek salads to have some veggies in us and to feel good so that's the plan for dinner we will show you guys the final results when it's finished cuz we're chefs now so I don't get hurt we're chefs you don't get to my face no I haven't assumed anyway as for chefs um okay so we just finished making the Greek salad stunning you guys I'll have it on my cooking highlight on the internet with you guys want to know the recipe I just want to do it like both on the blog in the industry I'm just be repetitive but so good and then just heating up the chicken we just got a roasted chicken from Costco so easy peasy lemon squeezy but we still got our veggies in and some fresh homemade Greek salad good morning guys so it is obviously the next day hold on and I am just currently getting ready for the day it's super and gloomy out today but I still wanted to put a little makeup on like yesterday I felt like it made me feel a lot more productive just cuz I felt like I wasn't just in my pajamas but I was also kind of getting ready for the day so that is what I am doing again today you guys I woke up yesterday with like the biggest pimple on my cheek like of all time as you can see I'm like covering up there um but then I put zits ticka on which you guys I need to show you it's crazy this is not sponsored but I wish it was honestly because it's truly magic I tested them on my Instagram stories a couple weeks ago and I showed you guys like the before and after and I have been using them ever since and so this is what the packaging looks like anyways I use it last night and like the pimple you guys is like almost gone and I feel like if I do it for like one more night it'll be completely gone so if you guys have like stubborn pimples that you want to like take care of before like a big event or anything I highly recommend does it stick us and I also recommend you guys know the glossy a zit stick as well those are like my to go to Syd's uppers because girl we all get those pimples anywho so earlier in this vlog you guys I told you guys I created a tik-tok and um a ton of you guys have been requesting me to make one so I kind of avoided it as you guys know it was just like not the app for me I thought and it probably still isn't to be honest with you but honestly it like lately especially in quarantine I've been spending time watching it and I actually find it so funny so I thought that I would make one today and I'm gonna try to attempt to make my first tick tock here on the vlog and you guys can see the behind the scenes of me trying to make one but yeah this like account is not gonna be like I don't think professional in any way shape or form I think it's just gonna be like a fun app to like play around with and be creative and like do funny videos with like Pippin stuff so don't expect like high quality content on there but um it'll definitely be fun content and I'm excited to try it out and literally don't on to use the app at all like if you asked me to make it to talk right now like I just would not be able to so I'm gonna have to figure that out before I make the first stick talking literally let me know how to use the app anyways I'm just gonna get ready for the rest of the day and I'll see you guys in a little bit okay so before I get to my tick talking I have to find an outfit to wear but I think for my first tick-tock I'm gonna be like gonna be doing like a shoe one so I think I need to wear like shorts because I need to like show my legs because I'm doing a shoe one okay I think I'm gonna do my little boxer shorts and then there's like a t-shirt because you guys would get what I'm saying I need to show my legs I can't wear pants because I'm showing all my shoes so tada super cute outfit honestly I don't really care much like wearing pajamas okay now I need to go film it in my office because I'm going to be showing my shoe wall so I think I'm gonna like do the shoe wall and then I'm gonna do like my top six or something favorite designer shoes or something like that I thought that'd be cute because I want to keep it like fashion but like also I want to do some like fun videos and stuff that are more chilled I guess that I'm not really taking this app seriously but I still wanna incorporate like fashion and stuff because obviously that's what I do so anyways I'm gonna set this up set the scene up and then we'll start tik talking you guys okay so the first thing I think you need to do is pick a song on the tick-tock app so I think I'm going to do this one that one exciting it's cue and like everyone does it so going with the kids going with the trends so I think you just have to like pick the sound that's what it is and that is all I know so far okay I think I did it I think I did it right and now I have to do my shoes wait this is so much easier than I thought Steven this is so much easier than I thought but how do we do it without touching it   what are my second issue   yeah you guys so cute OS image  cute okay not to edit it I'll know how to do that okay so it has been like an hour since I posted my tic TOCs and I'm gonna go see if I blew up yet because apparently it's very easy to like go viral on this app so okay so I posted three tik toks by the way since we last spoke I posted the shoe one that you guys saw and then I also posted one app in talented brilliant incredible amazing show-stopping spectacular so funny and then I also posted one of our apartment because it's just like an old video that I had that I thought it was anyways post three the first one is a seven nine hundred views which honestly not bad the other ones at four hundred and the ones at fifty so maybe will blow up I don't know I don't think we are going to blow up anytime soon here but but now since today is apparently a tick tock day I'm gonna make another one and I'm gonna do like 5 quarantine outfits like fun cute like sweat suits which I just did that on YouTube anyways so I thought it'd be fun to just like do it on tik-tok now so I'm gonna go and film that okay I'm bored in the house and I'm in the house bored bored in the house and I'm in the house bored bored in the I was bored and I'm bored in him up again I was bored bored in a house bored in the house bored bored in a house bored in the house boy okay guys update we still have not blown up on tick tock tick tock can't even said that however I did post another video I'll insert it before this thing I showed you guys already but it was like the five co-op was in quarantine anywho I was just having but I think I have to put my phone down and move on from this app because it can be very distracting not productive unless tick tock is like your thing anyways so now I am going to actually start editing this vlog to have it up for you guys today or tomorrow maybe but yeah I thought I would just end the vlog here because it is what day is it today so it is Thursday and I have a
