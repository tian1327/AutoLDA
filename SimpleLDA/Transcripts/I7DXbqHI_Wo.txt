those corn dogs yesterday i kind of just like passed out but we don't really have anything to do today but i do feel like getting ready so we're gonna get ready see where the day takes us okay so now we're gonna just do my makeup really quick i've been doing a bunch of makeup recently weirdly i don't know why i think it's just like the way that i cope under this quarantine to be honest also don't mind the mess that's because of tick tocks so recently i've been taking a liking to doing makeup it's weird i know i i've never really been one to like experiment with makeup but recently i have if you've seen my instagram probably put a picture right here yeah i know that's me surprisingly um the power of makeup right yeah i don't like beauty blenders because they kind of just like soak up all the products and i just don't really like the consistency of a sponge on my face i don't know why okay this is a finished look now we're gonna change okay so this is the before outfit nasty all right well let's change don't lie to me that was pretty smooth like tik tok origins are showing transition god it's a very basic outfit but we're just gonna go to the park really so it doesn't really matter what i wear as long as it's not as restrictive because it's hot outside although it has been cold in the morning so hopefully i don't freeze that i'm also bringing my guest backpack because it fits all of my sketch pads and everything in there we will slap on this baby protection pretty much good to go shoes would probably be nice shoes have been acquired i just threw on some air force ones the first thing that i always put in of course is my sketchbook full of sketches and all that stuff so this is essential or else what's the point you know my watercolors these are from windsor and newton not sponsored by the way i wish that i'm going to bring my gauche paints these are the ones that i have so sorry about my nails my paintbrushes and sorts these are the ones that i have just random ones that i found on amazon and then i always bring a mechanical pencil and an actual pencil and i bring paper castle artist pen i don't know it's like a black ink pen that you know it just can get the job done bring my small prismacolor portable one i have like a huge one over there but i just bring like the portable ones the essential ones just in case i want to add color as well and also bring a bunch of washi tape a water bottle and a granola bar just in case if i get really thirsty or really hungry i like to sit where there's like grass and like a tree next to me or something very aesthetic if you will like to sit on the grass a lot very isolated from everyone so i always bring like a towel or something so that i can sit on so my butt won't be hurting on the grass and stuff so yeah yeah that's pretty much what i bring in my backpack well i got the keys and now we're ready to go bye mother i'll see you never i'm running away okay you don't care whatever i will you be careful with your knitting don't poke yourself with the needle okay now that i'm away from people i took off the mask um i'm gonna just lay here and paint    it's time to go home  it's time to go home because i'm hungry and i kind of want a sandwich so let's go my mom surprised me and she came to the park i'm here so now we're just here chilling  i forgot to end the vlog thank you for staying to the end
