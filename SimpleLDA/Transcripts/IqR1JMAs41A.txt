inside and see if they have some of the things that I actually need and then I'm going to head to Target so yeah let's go so I have my mask on and then I put my gloves on and head inside so it just came out of Dollar Tree and they did have some of the stuff they didn't have a lot of the stuff but I did know it as people wearing gloves not that many people had on masks but because they can't find them everyone's asking me like oh wait you get your masks from this is the regulated one the one that that they say is regulated to happen so now I'm on my way over to Target and let's see what they

and I already have vegetables and I already have you know I had some fruit and I'm not like one eat I'm just kind of like Midway restocking so I'm like yeah what would we do really I mean there's no shortage of the food the shipments will be coming in there's the trucks are still rolling like zombie apocalypse no food water no no like right now on my agenda I'm going to work on some music I'm going to finish up some tracks everybody has to work from home so it's like you may as well take advantage of it I have a couple of students that I am tutoring online so if you need online tutoring

else but here in New York we are working from home I'm hearing rumors of a 10:00 o'clock curfew right New York City so all the restaurants are closed you can pick up or you can have it delivered but you cannot go inside sit and eat which i think is great New York City public schools are closed so kids are home I actually used to teach a boy taught from 2:00 to 5:00 so I was a daycare teacher in the midst of you know the time frame of my life i homeschooled my son when he was doing acting i homeschooled him for four years so I think I have some pretty good tips and pointers on what to do when you want a homeschool your kid you know just keep yourself mentally you know active physically active take a break get up eat lunch you know have a breakfast you know stuff like that just keep it going keep it fun that's what you know basically what the what the deal is right now because we don't actually know how long we're gonna be quarantined away from each other so to speak as far as business and school goes so we need to be careful of our contact with people that's why wearing masks and stuff like that but yeah you know create a schedule for yourself and be safe be really safe
