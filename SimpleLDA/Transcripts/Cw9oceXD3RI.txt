   you always looked after me brother when we were children you always had my back you took all the blame when I father oh god I was doing things there did you guys know that Heine right now the police are going door-to-door and knocking and checking the temperatures of the citizens and anyone who has a temperature gets sent to the quarantine I think that's very scary but at the same time we are practicing social distancing I know everyone doesn't take it seriously but the point is is not to overload the system so if our hospitals right now have beds for 40 people you don't want them you don't want 50 people to get sick and then 10 people hitting critical condition and dying because they don't have the necessary tools anyways let's get out of here people are giving me looks insecurity anyways  I wanna say that I'm sorry I got sidetracked and I left you in the cold I've seen your side of the story I felt the trouble my mistake took its toll  every was there I was it make it straight and from here okay guys here's a little news update there's a stimulus plan that's like about trillion dollars that is going to give a thousand dollars to each adult now $500 for every child and in the family unit so if you had four people in your family unit two parents and two children you will get $3,000 now this stimulus plan is to help boost the economy and help those people that are out of a job not only that that's I think 70% of that stimulus plan is for that reason the other remaining part of the you know the boost is to help payroll companies for small businesses and companies to help make sure their payroll is paid and help companies that are going bankrupt because of bars are closing down and whole bunch of locations are not open yeah let's go to a different place   if you've ever been to the Brad Museum you know that this place is packed tourists all over the streets there's a line out the door people are checking out the crazy architecture in the tall buildings I think this Street Grant Avenue and second is one of the most beautiful streets in Los Angeles so if you do get a chance to come you know cuz now you have time you're probably off of work come check this place out obviously keep like your distance cuz you know six feet but there the streets are pretty much empty and you could come and enjoy the beauty of the city without having the congestion and the traffic that normally comes with that so get yourself out here walk around have a good day let's go to a different spot logging of 10 to 15 pound camera with a monitor on it and backpack and drone gear is not fun so I'm calling this vlog success and over gladly over I get to go home and sleep I woke up like at 7:00 in the morning but as far as the bad news goes please take a deep breath stay at home learn something new cook get the piano lessons on YouTube anything and everything to make yourself a better person and self develop and these times is just as productive if you went to work I think this momentary pause and self-reflection will give you a much stronger you know stamina going forward in your life I don't take it as a negative take it as a positive as far as that goes I hope you're OK I hope you feel good I hope you're not scared and enjoy the rest of the drone footage I have and have a nice day until the next vlog hopefully we're not all screaming and there's the purge going on and yeah that would suck anyways peace  you
