 all right I'm into this supermarket I got my gear on and actually now oh I think it's kind of early for it to be full but it's full nonetheless all the way back here I hope the store isn't that crazy   earng I'm just now leaving a supermarket that took way too long when I tell you in there people who are not social distancing I'm just like our people brain dead or just not conscious of what's going on like why are you like an inch away from me like move I don't understand people and then like okay I get before they were saying don't use math people shouldn't wear fast cuz it's taking away from doctors and nurses which I totally agree with I get it but like if you don't have a mass you should be wearing some type of covering on your face a scarf a t-shirt or something like protect yourself because you don't know what's going on out here you don't know what you might have and I know you have and then you're spreading it to other people like protect yourself I'm not saying go buy up all the PPE and and hoard it for yourself when there's people who are like saving lives that need it god bless those people but like come on I don't understand how people don't have PPE on like some sort of coverage to protect yourself when I tell you this lady in the line and her husband were like kissing someone else's cart like I'm talking cart to cart they had no regard for the six feet separation and thank God they weren't near me because the lady behind me um she got it she was like six feet was good sis but the people behind her like I don't get people first of all people do that normally where they're like oh the the line movin in let me move up closer no this is not that time when you do that the my line will lose an inch you stay where you add come on New York we got to do better we got to do better this is ridiculous yeah so the lines were so long said that they were going down the aisles themselves and the only like separators on the lines were at the front once you got to the register they had blue tape where you needed to stand when checking out but everywhere else people were just like back to back to back like I I'm just like at a loss for words at this point thankfully I don't have to check nobody because I was ready to respectfully you know just ma'am sir please can you step back thank God I didn't have to do that but not everybody is being smart as I'm saying and it's it's it's young and it's old like the ignorance has no regard for age like it's everybody being ignorant that's the line to the text or you see five below Michaels but that code was like further past it all right it's about 115 I'm going another stop to target but I'm hungry I could eat some right now I don't have my resolutions out for me I'd love to you take a couple drops right now boy I'm sorry but I think I think I did good from like six seven $30.00 7:30 this morning till about 1:00 something I think that's pretty pretty good at least for me for doing this right oh thank you so much thank you funny how much Windex and laundry detergent the knobs but don't know why do you want to wash windows do laundry that's target they did that right when I tell you the line to get in was away even in the store like it wasn't overly crowded like I had major anxiety in fairway because there was like too many people that stores not even that big it was just too much so I just had some more odds and ends to get at Target and I'm glad I came over here and it was just so much more so much better than comparison home you
