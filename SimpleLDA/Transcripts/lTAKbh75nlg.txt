you guys kind of walk well a lot of people as a matter of fact a lot of people he's walking in the street everybody's covering their mouth of course but they still outside as you're walking because here in New York and walk like you don't happen I like that actually in my country in Serbia everything nice like a finish and they open they opened the country but before then they they have the car whew yeah they have car fuel and then was the crazy for example that means from from Thursday to Monday you need to stay at home come you cannot live at home even if you want to go to the grocery or you know and I don't I'm not sure she's that way necessary could be you know but honestly ServiceNow open they're not an emergency state anymore to be an actor they're not get in a lot of cases and

you live close to the water BAM we are almost there I think we are like ten minutes away from Coney Island and I just hope I just I'm just hoping that there is food like that's all I'm hoping something to eat and there's so much people walking by the my a date in Coney Island during pandemic how crazy we never did this stuff when was summer and like you know we needed to waiver epidemic to now want to discover New York to go to places but well did you guys know this that is a few days 50 days it's June first call for your best and what we did almost on the I think yeah sitting at home nothing for half oh yeah so basically for half of this year east but maybe let's be grateful we both healthy you know there's a lot of people that they didn't make it to even that all they half of you but but we gotta be grateful that we get to do this and you guys probably wondering where are your masks we have our mask you once we get out from the car we're gonna wear and of course but in the car I don't think is very necessary and yeah we are almost there  so guys we are here and now we are searching for some food and I see a Turkish kebab and it looks like it's open so we probably gotta go to this open burgers yes to pick up right I don't care like we can eat in the street we can you wherever but most likely there is what we're gonna eat however we're just waiting for our friends to see what we're gonna do and then yeah so this is Coney Island whoa this is not Conni Adam but it's in the same area so guys I know that I said that I saw a Turkish kebab but is closed so I'm gonna be

mark twain's US market     so that's a quick update we are in Coney Island oh my god it's nice like I'm surprised because I always went to a different part of Coney Island and now that I came to a different side of Coney Island it's kind of fun our friends are laughing in the back it's kind of fun like the weather is good the water is good which is a natural dress too well look body's cold
