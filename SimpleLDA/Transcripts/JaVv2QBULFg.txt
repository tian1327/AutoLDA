 good morning YouTube it is Tuesday April
7th and today I thought I would film a quarantine day my life because I thought
there's not really much else going on in life at the current moment besides
quarantined it's about 7:45 right now I don't know why me and shot been waking
up so early the past few days yesterday I woke up before 7 a.m.
Who am I what is that I don't understand quarantine is going fine I'm on day 24 I
think I counted on my fingers I think that's right I've been quarantine since
the 15th of March we're doing well doing fine I've got some editing to do for
three videos that you guys will be seeing in the coming weeks I usually do
some dance classes and stuff and I've been a little bit less motivated to move
last week yeah I just didn't feel like getting up out of bed and getting up off
the couch last week so I'm trying to do more of that and get back into like a
moving mindset I feel like I'm just feeling a little bit cramped here in the
apartment because we have a good amount of space but not a ton to like move
around a lot try being more motivated with God come along with me on a day in
quarantine I mean look at this cutie oh hello well good workout this turned out at the
morning now antique shower can get ready to be productive for the day also if you
don't know who that is that we are watching for a workout it's the fitness
marshal he has a lot of just like great dance based workout so you just follow
his dances on YouTube so go subscribe to that it's really really good it's really
really fun video all right I am freshly showered and now I'm gonna go through
like my moisturizing getting ready routine everything I do I shave my legs
today so I have to moisturize a little bit differently than I normally do so
I'm gonna start with my Aveeno do the moisturizing lotion on my legs before I
get dressed now if I am dressed let's start our morning routine I actually got
dressed in a real clothing today liking this look at that get the past three
days I've been wearing sub pants to get started on my morning routine I keep
putting any coats it's my morning routine s what I've been doing every
morning I've been using this Herbal Essences totally twisted curl boosting
mousse that Sean actually got me or grandma one of the two of them got me
like a care package with a lot of soaps and stuff and this kind of stuff in it
so I'm using this Brooklyn uhm but I put that in my hair to keep the girl a
little bit so for moisturizers I use two different moisturizers I use first the
cleaning clear dual action moisturizer which is also like an acne medication
one just to like to try to keep my skin nice and clear I'm using this one since
2013 since my first went to college and my friend Paul who I looked with who
you've probably seen in a million videos if you about your channel before he told
me about this fun and I really liked you see because I really saw the difference
and my acne and my skin we just get a little bit dry but I use another one on
top of it but that's all the salicylic acid medication doing its work it's like my stress if I use is maybe a
soft moisturizing cream my friend Kristen told me about this Kristen for
meeting me so if you've watched me those videos from 2018-2019 know who she is
but yeah it's a pretty lightweight moisturizer and I was in the market find
a new one after and finishing up of one from lush that was cheaper and this one
is very cheap i doing read um so yeah i just use a little bit of that to keep
miss game nice and soft carbon is very cautiously coming over to small the
camera hi kitty cat don't knock this over oh my
god oh good we stepped right over it and then lastly i use some cherry chapstick
to keep my lips nice and soft they've been extremely dry during this winter
season and that's all there is to getting ready for me and i have not been
wearing my contacts practically at all during quarantine I feel like it's a
nice needed break for my eyes because of waking up very early to go to auditions
and do background work and I was doing all that and working late and everything
like that so there are glasses all the time so it's like a real throwback to
high school and college me the only time I put in contacts have been result tapes
and that's the only time I've put on makeup as well the entire time during
quarantine which is very weird for me as well because I don't not wear makeup all
right now we can see the world so now I'm going to have some breakfast and get
things started for the day I also always have been making the bed every single
day throughout quarantine I don't normally do this I don't know how to
make the bed I've got my tea to start off the day now
I'm going to go into my office which has been the bedroom because Sean works from
home in the front room he's working from home for about a year and a half so this
whole work from home thing is nothing new for him but I've been setting up on
the bed looks like a little like desk that we bought for when we game I've
been using it as like a different area to work and to change up the scenery a
little bit there like when I'm sitting in the front room I just want to like
turn on the TV and sit on the couch and do nothing so being in here and lemco
can't force my thought to do some work though the plan for today is to edit
three videos and actually film a fourth one that will be going up in May is what
it looks like at the current moment and later in the afternoon I'm gonna do some
dance classes I've been doing dance classes on Tuesdays in particular with
Natalie Milwaukee and I'll blackstone may be doing Instagram live classes
right we are in our normal filming location because we have just filmed the
intro talking clip and outro clip for the other video that I'm going to be
editing that I wanted to film today now to actually get to editing my videos
because I have an excerpt of that I got stuck watching YouTube videos that I
missed so now I'm going to get to work it's about 11:15 right now so I'm
planning on living until 3 o'clock or 2 o'clock it is 240 all of my videos are pretty
much edited I'm exporting one of them now I have to do the graphics of the
text on the third one the second one is all edited as well I should you like
double check all of the edits make sure it all looks alright but we made
progress I was trying to get everything done by 2:30 with all my edits so I got
almost all of it done but I'm doing my class at 3:00 so I need to eat some
lunch because I am starving so I'm gonna go make a salad and then do musical
theater all right g-great classes with Natalie
and al all done now back to editing to finish editing that last video last
video is finish editing and we just export yes hey John yeah what are you
filming me what they want to documenting our future
yeah she's a big toe this is the musical Victor who might not be a big tough I
could zoom in on it magical big-time inspires missing
we've been watching so is extraordinary playlist and every time he wants to sing
he keeps grabbing the victim what is it it's Tuesday will be a quarantine for me
it's 24 I counted this one I just put in the beginning holy did you come back
the 18th so 18 19 20 I can't do today was productive I got all the videos that
I wanted to edit I have one more to edit well two more to edit with this one and
the other one that I was filming I think I'm gonna do that tomorrow maybe a
little bit of it tonight right now I'm gonna go empty the dishwasher from doing
the dishes last night China's playing video games currently and then I'm going
to make dinner and then we are gonna watch the shits Creek series now it's about 9:30 now I just finished
watching the shit squeak series finale and the documenting afterwards made me
cry of it so I mean my feelings but about that but it was so good I thought
I wish the episodes were longer they always was so short but the documentary
afterwards really made up for it so really have they decided to make that
with it I also was hoping how we get my unemployment check today I'm supposed to
get it through a direct deposit but I got a card in the mail that I didn't
sign up for so I need to call unemployment tomorrow and figure out
what's going on with all of that because I didn't sign up to get this key to
benefits card that I'm supposed to have my money on it doesn't make sense
because that's not what I signed up for so streeting because I called them 106
times to finally get through to them after doing my application so I'm just
wish would all go correct once would be ideal I don't really have much else
planned for the evening I think I'm gonna edit this video on the other video
that I was working on and call it a night thank you guys for watching I hope
you enjoyed seeing what a quarantine banal life is like for me and Shawn here
in our little apartment in Brooklyn hope you guys are all staying safe and
healthy and yeah all that good positive vibes that we need for this weird time
