  are you thinking about vlogging it's March something Saturday I'm recording on my phone today today is March 21st right now we're in the middle I'm from New York I mean you're I'm located in here I don't know right now we're in the middle of life they're crazy Korona outburst this we've been told you know to not go out a lot of pressure on shutdown and whatnot but today I should be more cautious I think God gave me a gift he said I really I really miss doing like hair and makeup and I haven't been able to do work weddings and stuff in a while so I'm really excited it is currently 903 I have to leave the house at 9:10 and get to work around nine thirty Seconds to ten fifteen minute drive I just want to eat a bit early yeah I could not sleep last night I think I slept that life for I don't know like I just couldn't sleep for the life of me and it's really worried so I prayed and then I just watched like a bunch of like hair tutorials to like refresh my mind I would be a lot every time I go into work like to do hair makeup for clients especially for weddings I'm always nervous people will encourage me you know my close friends would encourage me my family will encourage me and told me it'll be okay and even like my boss is very kind about it she's like don't worry I got your back if anything happens but you know it's like such an important and special day that I can't help but feel very nervous that I might do something wrong like for someone else's wedding but I think it's good I don't go in conceited and yeah I make sure I try not to rely on myself but I rely on God like kind of antiques I couldn't sleep I will I like I just tried not to look at the time after 4:00 because then it's gonna play in my mind are you and they slept it's the amount of hours so I just but I the last time I saw my phone or like the time was like I want to say like three something and then I went to watch Instagram videos and I had to wake up at seven because I take a while to get ready coffee but yeah I'm gonna start heading out in gonna blog I'd sense like the vibe of the bride and like a bridal party if they see you like like that I'm just probably not gonna record I don't want to make them feel any more nervous or I got a card real quick so for work when there is a wedding my boss likes me to look it polished but together she like her eyewear you know you can amount of makeup so I don't look like a bum but my glasses like you know like like they know what they're doing you get kind of nervous I just wear like a black t-shirt and a blazer just like like all black it's just I am not required but I just think it's easy I'd either like the clothes I don't care about if I can't like makeup on myself or it washes off easily I'm like this material and stuff look the flowers are blossoming and waiting outside like that their own parking shoes I like now it's like freezing and then saying it's gonna snow in trees but like no bright yesterday I was like in this mask it was I never wear a mask so it was very uncomfortable surprisingly my makeup didn't like come on too much but my mouth looks nasty yeah all that orange is mine now he's agreed to go to the venue so we finished makeup for bridal party and we're gonna head to the church there sure Louise at apparently they were going back and forth about canceling the wedding or not all tours in New York has to close tonight by 8:00 p.m. where we're getting fine and now we're going to yeah just walking around this door talking to myself I'll show you the new dresses better on this place so beautiful this one's by the front like mermaid but like slowy that's my spot at work it's outside there's like barely any cars catching a breather for a second now we have to decorate the eating area finish cleaning everything and we're back at the shop - why are we back here right you like you know unmold it's like everything I never asked for anything but today   33 but my watch is three minutes faster so it's 8:30 look at me look at me I look like a hot mess I look crazy my mask looks so nasty on it that's all my foundation but like I touch top month right now I'm so tired okay so before anyone calls this couple raisi for getting married I do want to see that they've been planning their wedding for the longest time it's not like they decided to get married last minute and they were thinking about canceling it but I think their parents and they're in love kind of just push the wedding on them they wanted to get married at a nice venue but they couldn't like the venue canceled on them because of the coronavirus in the bridal party their bridesmaids were so oh so nice overall today was great I'm very grateful our shop is officially closing for hopefully no more than two weeks or so but you know whatever happens happens very fun but that was my blog today of a wedding going on during Dakar the virus in New York and I wanted to rest and watch some Netflix and I'm eating my favorite sweet kettle popcorn but I just wanted to say some things I mentioned before that like I couldn't sleep today and I was so like anxious and nervous but I prayed and all these things but I really I really really felt like God answered my prayers and beyond like I mean like no one gave me such a difficult time because you know when it comes to makeup like people can be very picky because it's not about what I can do but it's really important about am i listening to what this person wants or needs you know and I mean it anyways and the bridesmaids the bridal party that came in today we're very um they were very kind they are very flexible they were very like laid-back and they weren't super picky about anything not that there's anything wrong with being picky actually but I'm very picky but they were so encouraging they're like do you have a card do you have like it's a great page and I just felt so encouraged and like grateful that they really that they really liked my work and I'm so happy but I yeah I just thank God so much for that he like answers my prayers and like so much more and I'm like oh my god I don't deserve this I'm so grateful that yeah God answers your prayers so please pray please please pray for this virus please pray for your loved ones um I really think I despite all the negativity that is going on it's such a good time to fast and pray taking like physical mental whatever distractions await so we can really just stay at home and pray like it sounds bad like okay I can't pronounce the word quarantine yourselves but it means just to step away from the world just for a little bit and I don't think the focus should be on what's gonna happen to us we should be focusing in on God and like really putting our attention to him and wondering and trying to listen to what it is he's trying to tell us right now I know like this virus is affecting so many just families and friends and what is it small businesses and like I my company technically close oh I mean thank God I still have this wedding shop job but I my company is closed for burly and we don't know when we're gonna open and even like the wedding shot like today is the last day actually and we're closing down who knows when we're gonna open and right now we had about 25 weddings planned but it just they all just like cancelled or they're rescheduling it and we don't have any weddings until June or July and our shop has to close down so we're all on the state bolt right now everything is interrelated and not it's not just like one person that's getting affected and I think this is the time for us to really be loving and caring and like really praying for one another and like no I know it's so much easier said than done but I hope we can all pray just trust God and stronger to him be honest with him converse with him for whatever's I should not be eating and talking about so but yeah whatever is on your heart and mind um let's bring it to God no it's crazy so he listened to everything I always have to watch what I say in my mind or you know what I just say god I'm sorry playing hey personally I'm always cursing I'm working on it I'm working on my heart I guess I really wanted taste I'm excited for this time I'm sorry I'm doing it again this is very subconscious I don't mean to eat and talk at the same time but I'm really excited for this time I but yes thank you for tuning in and we're really watching this video oh I did good I don't want to it though but yeah once you go from him to Metis you
