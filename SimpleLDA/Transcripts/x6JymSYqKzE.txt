    good morning it is Saturday April 11th I am so happy to be alive and healthy I'm just like in such a good mood and there's so much fun stuff to do today and yesterday I uploaded a new yoga sequence video so if you haven't gone and done that go do it because your body deserves some nice healthy movement and it would appreciate it a lot but it was just making me feel really creative uploading those yoga videos and I wanted to film videos again so here we are and it's Saturday I rush to the grocery store this morning to beat the Saturday morning crowd because you know it can get you can get pretty pretty hairy at the grocery store on a Saturday morning if you don't remain so I didn't make a list I just ran and grabbed things that I thought I would want and I'm gonna show you what I got okay I got flour some cans of beans tomatoes corn we've been going through like a soup phase and of course I've been going through a baking phase so there's that celery lots of carrots I've been to hummus just like some regular veggies some ginger avocado onion broccoli got some more yeast for bread potatoes rice some spray tomatoes cucumber baby bok choy because then they got this at the store you know it's a good day onions onions mushrooms bananas a mango the berries were $0.99 today so I had to snag some some lettuce and I got this big case of blue moon I usually only get a six pack but I love the mango one and they only had it in this like big share pack so I got the big pack but it also has an iced coffee blonde and that sounds really good so I think it was worth it but yes I'm just happy to have a good I'm excited to be creative and have some freaking fun so yeah I'm gonna put all this stuff away and we'll see what I get up to next I have no idea hello this giant thing of oranges from work because they were gonna go bad and I'm gonna make orange juice and give them to anyone in a mile radius of me and I'm really excited so better juice all of these oranges  I have my OJ it looks green oh my god it's not sure snot ranges then are we take it to our friends okay things have changed it was so nice out it was sunny the high was like 70 and then like I sat down to play animal crossing real quick and I played for like 15 minutes and I looked up and the Sun was gone it was like dark outside like do you see how dark it is in my apartment right now like usually this place is lit up and it is just so dark so today went from being really productive and having so many things that I was really excited to do to me wanting to make soup play animal crossing and watch TV with Luke so I think that's what we're gonna do instead and we might pick up with the productivity on a Sunday because it's just like the perfect weather to sit on the couch and watch TV I can't I have it's what I have to do it has to be done you have to take advantage of this so I'm gonna practice some yoga real quick while I wait for Luke to get here because I have some sequences that I came up with that I need to memorize which is probably the most difficult part is memorizing them so I'm going to do that     good morning happy Sunday as you can see the Sun is back it is a beautiful day so fingers crossed it doesn't go away like it did yesterday um and now I can get to all my fun activities today last night we made soup and it was really good eating just like we sat on the couch finished Ozark and played Animal Crossing all night so you get my saw too much across and speaking up I've been playing Animal Crossing all morning so you still haven't missed much I did draw this little like lemon guy right here so that was something fun but I'm about to stain some pieces of wood so let's do that      it is like not the hottest day it could possibly be in Texas but it is hot out there and I was like sitting in the Sun you can like tell my cheeks get so red whenever I get hot but I mean it's being able to cool me down so I'm about halfway through with my staining of all those plant stands and it's making me really excited there's they look so good so yeah I'm going to eat this because I'm hungry and I need a cool-down    sorry if my dishwasher is like obnoxiously loud but I made myself my midday coffee because I am such a morning person to the point where if I don't drink coffee and like the afternoon I won't like I'll get crabby before that just because I need sleep you know what I mean pick up people get crabby in the morning because they didn't get enough sleep I get crabby at night before bed because I'm tired and so I need coffee and everything a coffee I make the almond milk on the spot because I don't like buying I look at the store anything it makes it so much better it's so good so I'm having my coffee during this little plant making break the mess is finally all clean all the plants are in their spots this is probably my favorite part is this little stand right here just every plant is perfect I love this guys spot I love this guy's new spot I'm just like so happy with my plant so this was another project I did today I stained the brown parts of my TV stand they were just like a normal white color or not white wood color and today I finally stained them all of these like pieces are just something I threw together real quick to fill in the slots I kind of loved it but I definitely want to change it I'm thinking of getting some like crystal bookends and putting them in one of them I think it would be so cute and finally I just pulled some more orange muffins out of the oven and a big ol loaf of banana bread sporting this like half up half down look but in like the weirdest way it's the end of the day I don't like here hey you I just wanted to come on here and say that this like these past few days have been the most productive and like motivated I've been during quarantine like I swear the week before this I sat on the couch watch TV with Luke and play Animal Crossing for like a week straight other than the few days that I went to work so this is like I'm just I feel like I'm just trying to like put it into perspective this is not me all the time especially today I feel like today of all days I did the most I felt like there were endless hours in the day today and I just got so much done it was honestly so great but grand scheme of things not every day is like that so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and end the video here I really enjoyed filming it I'm very excited to edit it as I've been filming it I have all these ideas of like editing in my head if I make sense so I'm really excited to edit it and I hope you guys enjoyed watching it and there will be more yoga videos very soon so until then good bye what kind of muffins did you think they were
