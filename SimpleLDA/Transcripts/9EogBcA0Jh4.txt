 grant rising over Isis and cha-cha no never Megan now we are on our way Remus  as you guys already know my camera fell and broke yesterday that's the bad news the good news is that I remembered that I had a GoPro Hero which is what you guys are seeing right now the bad news is is I'm never crazy about this fish eyed quality that it gives however it's just I have to do for now you guys just gonna have to bear with me please bear with me trying to even get this app on my phone she's supposed to connect this to so I guess you can see it from your phones because obviously the GoPro doesn't have a selfie feature if you know about these cameras now as far as these cameras go they are great for active sports activities you guys know that people put them on fight people post them up different places you know when they're doing very energetic and active events and everything so for those reasons these cameras are great vlogging you know unless you're vlogging some kind of athletic event or you're riding a bike or something like that but we're gonna make this work today not sure exactly how I'm going to vlog now as far as placement anyways let's get started with our date all right so I'm actually looking into getting this canon powershot digital camera the g7 x mark 2 so I have seen this camera before this was a widely reviewed camera also one couple youtubers that are watched here and can't they used to have this but I don't think they have this anymore thinking about getting this camera however he's got to do is you got a doofus I gotta get these videos out right now I'm actually gonna get ready to do a little juicing and I have not eaten breakfast yet so definitely want to make some breakfast oh my gosh you guys just have to give me because I know this light frustration is showing I cannot see myself like where are you looking I know my head is cut off I don't know you just have my neck up I can't even see this right now but either way I'm have to put this video out this is just wild something no this is my juicer here we're gonna take that I have my fruits and vegetables and they're like I said gonna make some breakfast I don't know if I want to do pancakes baking in next today or just make a sandwich Lissie my bad so definitely already made my sandwich my cousin came up here Havlicek however this is my sandwich and I told you I got the Genesis 1:29 bran turkey egg and cheese with some jelly I got I had a jelly with a sandwich like this and now we're going to get on to our juicing cuz I just want to hand me my sandwich first because you know my sis is hungry so I don't know if I ever told you guys I don't know if I want to call the cleanse or whatever but I literally just juice and this is all I ate for breakfast lunch and dinner got my carrots a kiwi a lemon of one pair and one Apple that's gonna be our juice with this market so this is pretty much how I have it set up I have to make sure this is locked on there I don't know if you guys have ever juice before literally when I got on it I was very skeptical winded up being a little tough because your girl loves to eat nobody's you understand that but after a while I did start feeling clean and I didn't want to really put anything else in my body even though I still wanted to eat about innovative thing I did I took the top from a go cup and I could kind of like the shape of what the nozzle is on here because if you're not careful it can splatter up which is why on some juicers whenever you have a cup kit with it it comes with the top  I made a little bit more juice just to fill it up but this is pretty much it hey and that is what's left of the sandwich you have to eatin it in the process of making the juice all right you guys it is 551 right now I went to sleep to Golden Girls and woke up with two and a half men didn't even know how long I took there now I feel like I didn't take it long but I need to take out the trash  people  I was actually thinking about wanna walk with you guys but uh whoo now we're doing it oh my goodness oh by the way I know I mentioned a giveaway but obviously it's put on hold along with rent and mortgages and credit card fees and everything else I think I just made the rest of this just one let you guys know but still stay tuned though I got you I got you guys so it's been some night of a day so I wanna let you guys know about the whole camera situation as of right now I order the Lumix the model that I ordered is the zs7 sear okay yes I am in the bathroom with my laptop I don't want to hear it I have good reasons but this is it here there's been some reviews on this I checked it out it was compared to another one but I'm just trying to get a good bang for my book pretty much I am the Amazon princess I know there are a lot of Amazon Queens out there yeah so this camera is pretty much 300 is to 97 99 I also got a three-year warranty on it so just something a little bit more in the Lord and right now compared to what my main camera is which I told you guys about that yesterday I'm not gonna give up on it more than likely I feel like it can be repaired and I'm also Amazon Prime right now so I get the two days shipping unfortunately me and you are going to have to tolerate this camera this camera for now but please let me know what you guys think about this I mean as far as a temporary situation are you just like no okay you know this is cool are you like you know what just stop making vlogs for a minute until you get your new camera and yeah so let me know if you think about that of course I want to keep putting out content for you guys and making up  because it's been - I can't wait to get the new camera but man with this whole coronavirus situation man I'm just oh so I don't know if I told you guys I was able to actually at 3:00 in the morning to actually get in my unemployment and fill out the application for it I'm so glad about that unfortunately I won't be able to complete my unemployment application until I give them a call they told me Wednesday but hopefully I can get in touch with them on Monday because I'm really trying to go ahead and just get it in pretty sure about this point it's over 80,000 applications all right so definitely not too much I'm doing too cold outside today there's too cold outside today for me we're going outside and doing things but tomorrow I actually have things to do hopefully I can get those things done tomorrow I'll tell you what I do like about this GoPro I love how a small and compact is very easy to maneuver and you know use around right now the battery is at one bar the berry kind of doesn't last all that long for me I got it off the charger and it was like at 98% um I was pretty much my only just like about it's just you know this fisheye camera quality thing but like I said it's perfect for what it's meant for which is active sport activities it's just not meant for vlogging but you know like I said it's gonna do we gotta do the only time I can get something said to you guys without being interrupted being in the same area as this guy see you guys tomorrow I'm putting you down I'm put now I want to put you down are you serious get down you're really not trying to even get down right now yeah you are going to get ya you should feel like him using his little muscles a little bit so we're gonna go ahead and actually close out this blog because it's really not much I'm gonna be doing today and just besides the fact I literally went to sleep and did not plan on taking a nap so arises of
