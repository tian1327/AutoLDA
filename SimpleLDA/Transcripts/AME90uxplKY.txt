  you know quarantine clean so relax betweens bb-8 good morning guys well not really I'm covering my mouth because I my retainers it it's literally 1 p.m. and I just woke up and I'm exhausted my sleeping schedule on this quarantine is so bad I've been falling asleep anywhere from like 3 to 5 a.m. I think last night he I wasn't on my phone when I was trying to fall asleep I tried going to sleep at 3 I don't think I fell asleep till like 4:30 and I tried to get up at 11 and it just it didn't work so here I am but I still wanted to film this video for you guys and try and have a productive day so yeah before we get started be sure to give this video a big thumbs up and also subscribe to my channel if you haven't already enjoying the family term I post notifications on I post every Tuesday Thursday and Saturday at 4 p.m. Pacific 7 p.m. Eastern I haven't been doing my weekly vlogs lately so I thought it would be fun to do this video but yeah enough of being in bed time to get up I'm gonna go to my bathroom put my contacts and and take my retainers out let's go  okay so now I go back into my room and my shades my room is a mess I'm sorry I've said in a few videos that my room here has kind of turned into like a storage room like I have this clothing rack moved over here and my mom put like boxes and stuff so I actually have to move this later cuz I want to film here in my old normal setup we're gonna film at Ryan Hall today so I'm gonna eventually move this but first have my package full of quarantine outfits of that fashion OVA sent me I'm actually gonna put this one on right now just to feel you know adds a little bit of excitement to the day wearing something new I'm gonna brush my hair and put it in like a low ponytail cuz this ain't it and I'm wearing to go downstairs so this is another thing that I mean I hope you guys remember this from my room tour if you used to watch my videos but mom I had like a shoe rack here too okay so nothing special literally just a basic ponytail getting my hair on my face just to feel less messy again this outfit is so cute it's like a little mock adidas but yeah enough of this I'm gonna take you guys downstairs with me I've never done a blog style video like this like when I lived in New York I would do routine videos but never vlog style like this so yeah let me check what there is in the fridge I told you guys in my voke get ready with me but I was gonna show you guys how I've been making my matcha iced latte so I am gonna do that today but first I'm gonna get a cup every day I've been filling out of this glass with lemon water and I've just been refilling in the sink up all day every day well not the same Cup but you know what I mean the same Cup for the day just filling this up grab lemon drop that in yeah and then I search for some food to eat and normally in the morning I'll either just stick with my lemon water also in quarantine I've been making like the whipped tik-tok coffee or like a smoothie and to be honest with you guys the past week week and a half I have been trying to stay away from Dairy well I have been trying to stay away from Dairy the whole 2020 if I'm being honest and coffee and all that but in quarantine had to satisfy my Creed links with like the macho and the whipped coffee it honestly just wasn't doing well for my body so I've been trying to cut it out but for the sake of this video I'm gonna show you guys how I make that macho latte so I'm gonna make an English muffin but I don't know good those are problem of waking up at 1:00 p.m. okay I'm gonna make myself a little sandwich so I'm gonna toast some bread I'm going to get my much ingredients out and then I will be back really simple all you need is matcha powder this is just the one that my mom had like in her cabinets and I'm using it's really good you're gonna need your blender and I just have like measurements I also use a sifter it's not really necessary if you're using a blender but it does help because the matcha powder is kind of clumpy all you're gonna do is take a cup of mill and and then you're gonna hold its iftar on top so you're gonna do like a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half it depends if you just want like a strong matcha taste which I love that I'll typically put more matcha powder and I just kind of sift it into the blender and since this is like literally the last of the matcha powder I'm just going to pour it in without measuring I want to try this with maybe some oat milk when I could finally like browse the supermarket's I've heard all milk is very good so we'll try that event and then I'm taking some organic blue agave this is just an alternative sweetener and I just do like a little less than a teaspoon of that because the matcha in my opinion is already kind of sweet I'm gonna shake this a little bit you see how it's clumpy there so hopefully like when I blend it do the single serve okay so that's probably enough in the blender it bubbles up I also did this without the blender I did it with like warm water to melt the matcha and then I pour it into milk like that but I kind of like the blender butter cuz it really just blends everything together so then I'm gonna get a cup with ice and there it pretty much is again just make sure to taste it see if you want more matcha les matcha but that's just kind of how I make my fake Starbucks matcha latte so now I made my way downstairs to my living and this is where I've been spending most my days in quarantine literally I grabbed my blanket and going net foot and I have been watching actually no no no sorry I finished season 15 of Grey's Anatomy so now I'm watching season 16 on Hulu where you at and then I'll eat my little lunch brunch and usually my mom's here with me and we're just chilling at today's a really beautiful day outside little sneak peek of my backyard and my backyard it's literally like woods and it goes around like over there but it's like 60 degrees in New York which is really good for April so today's the perfect day that I'm gonna take pictures and I have like coloring books I attempted to color one day but then I got bored so there's that okay I switch coaches to talk to I normally a typical quarantine day in my life I literally sit here all day with my mom on my laptop doing emails editing videos on my phone just fooling around relaxing spending time with family and we've been eating dinner together and then I come right back to this room and repeat the cycle and so today's a little bit different and I want us to sit down and disclaim that today is a more productive day in my life but this only happens I would say like two times a week but I figured it was a lot more fun to show you guys me getting ready in the behind the scenes of filming and behind the scenes of taking pictures and tick-tocks and all this stuff because literally if I did a video okay guys like I'm gonna sit here now this video would be four minutes long and it would be so boring so I just wanted to tell you guys that what you're seeing in this video is not me trying to be like oh my god I'm having such productive days like no this literally happens once or twice a week and and these two days that I decide to film and get ready I am getting so much content done it's ridiculous because you guys know me I've always said on my channel that I love hicking to film and get ready when I'm actually gonna go out after so it's been kind of hard for me to adjust to this whole quarantine and not being able to go anywhere and getting ready for no reason and I've just been trying to like soak in with family time I didn't ever really plan to film while I was here I plan to film like two or three videos but that was about it like I didn't plan to plan a whole month swear at the videos while being here my family and I have been spending plenty of time together but just not going out so it is kind of sad while I'm in New York and I hope next time that I come back to New York I could show you guys my favorite spots and go to the city and stuff like that it's honestly not looking New York's really really bad it's not looking like where I go back to LA I could do any type of adventures at all so definitely next time yeah I just wanted to make it clear that this definitely does not happen every day but yeah I'm going to go ahead and eat my lunch and relax for a little bit because then we're gonna go upstairs and I'm gonna do my makeup and my hair and I'm gonna show you guys like a little behind the scenes of like filming and taking pictures I guess like a work day in my life quarantine Edition I'm actually doing a lot of content today so I'm excited to walk you guys through that but let me stop talking I know this is a vlog but I'm gonna shut up now oh also I need to put my earrings in okay so now I'm going to make my bed sorry the sheets don't match because I took the polkadot ones to LA with me but yeah I'm actually gonna set up my phone tripod right by my window because I'm gonna be filming a don't rush challenge video with my no makeup right now I'm also I might as well move this rat in front of my dresser we'll do that in a second and I'm gonna also move these boxes just so that they're not in the background either way I need to do that for my video cuz I want to film right here so yeah and I actually got a package from morphe another one I'm literally so excited but I think I'm going to show you guys this a little later just because I want to get ready and do as much as I can before the Sun Goes Down so now it looks a lot more similar than used to it's missing like my YouTube play button and then also this I don't know I'll figure it out but so what we're working with right now I'm gonna set up my phone tripod here it is and we're gonna see if the don't rush challenge will look good right here I need to find my tripod we you could see good enough they're honestly want to get this done in or with because I really need to start getting ready okay that's cute whatever whatever that's just I'm overthinking this I need to get ready so I'm gonna do my makeup super excited I'm also in a coma do this oh my god sorry bad but I try and do this literally as fast as I possibly can again excuse the background but yeah I have about three hours until the Sun sets and so the plan for today is usually I'll do all my filming first and then all my pictures afterwards but today I want to do it a little bit differently just so the time kind of goes by not faster but just so it doesn't feel like so much weight I guess if that makes sense so basically what I'm going to do is I'm gonna do my makeup I'm gonna do my hair I'm gonna do the don't rush challenge then I'm gonna change into my first outfit for the Tryon hall and then I'm gonna go outside and take pictures in that and then I might do a tick-tock depending on what time it is at that point but then I'm gonna start filming the hall and midway through a the fifth or sixth outfit of the hall there's like 10 different outfits I have to try on the fifth or sixth outfit I'm gonna stop filming after it and I'm gonna go outside and take pictures in that one and then I'm gonna come back finish the rest of the haul and that should be perfect timing with the daylight and then my very last outfit I'm gonna take pictures with but I'm gonna take them on my bed well I don't really need sunlight for that one after I finished filming the hall I want to do two talks as well so I'm gonna kind of just do all that and then show you guys through it but right now I'm gonna test out I ordered a bunch of fancy products and I'm so excited so I'm gonna try them out today for my eye makeup I was gonna do just falsies but because of the don't rush challenge I wanted to do like a tiny bit more just so it looks more like the BAM and if you watch my spring try and ha I'm gonna wear the outfit that I said I was gonna wear for Easter which now Easter is cancelled I'm still gonna do an Easter get ready with me though I'm pretty sure I'm gonna do one of my classic glam looks that I'm sure you guys have seen I don't think I've ever done a tutorial on it but it's so simple yet glam if you watched my blog when I did my shoot with fashion OVA I did that exact layout or the shoot so it's just like neutral eye with a shimmer shade and then I take a little rhinestone and I put it there so I'm gonna do that look today so I'm not gonna talk to you guys the entire time I do my makeup but I did want to get my first impression of the funky foundation on camera hey guys I also did get the concealer and the match stick so I've already tried the soft matte I just got that in my correct shade now I went today let's try the hydrating long wearing on nation and if it looks started if it looks darker than my face don't wear hate it will match my body I already matched it I'm not proud of myself for matching myself online but my old shade was 270 I guess I was like my very darkest summer shade and I got it in the summer that's when I'm at shape but my normal shade I guess is 240 and I didn't get the Fendi primer like any of the tools so I'm just using my dose of color sponge and when i swatched this on my hand i absolutely fell in love first of all it smells amazing I have normal to dry skin so the other foundation is a beautiful matte don't get me wrong and I love it that's why I repurchase it of course that I owe just oh my god wow I don't even have like a full coat of this on and I'm obsessed like it just feels so hydrating and nice on the skin and it just gives such a skin like glow I'm real and you guys know I work with a lot of brands it takes a lot for me to want to splurge on a brand on my own so that should just go to show how much I love empty oh my god this is I'm $35 I'm sorry but I think that's amazing it has great coverage but it looks so much like I've never had any foundation do this when I personally think of like a hydrating dewy foundation I think of like lighter coverage it's definitely medium to full like they say it is but it just looks so natural and skin like and dewy and beautiful this is for sure gonna be my new everyday I'm gonna go ahead and do my brows and my lid base it'll be back for the concealer in the match I was gonna show you guys this in like a makeup tutorial but my makeup tutorials don't do as good as my vlogs anyway and I wanted to mainly do an Instagram tutorial okay I did Helen natural brows I've been barely filling them in lately and I'm gonna try out the 70 concealer I actually don't know is this supposed to be full color photo soft coverage okay let's see ooh okay I normally go with a thicker consistency concealer it does blend beautifully with the nation I probably just would color correct first as I have pretty dark circles and I could kind of see the shadow so there's gonna go with my tart shape T to neutralize use a match stick I got it in the shade latte you really like how it just glides I'm just gonna leave it like that again I'm trying to rush Oh blend it out so easily okay just proving my point my love for fancy product yes okay so I'm going in with my sponge to blend a little bit man lastly we're gonna try out your powder so I'm nervous cuz I got nervous every time I try any powder but I have there nothing but good things about this I got the shade banana that actually just seemed too light and usually I like banana shades anyway I'm gonna blend out the creases and set cool very high cover it's kind of pressing it in okay it's definitely brightened I just am concerned because it's leaving like a dark past I don't know maybe that is too dark this is why colored powders sometimes like aren't the best in the world but I'm gonna play with it some more from what I could tell it doesn't leave anything taking looks very smooth I just don't like that dark shadow around my nose under my contour and yeah I'm just gonna do the rest of my makeup cuz this is not a makeup video I hope you guys enjoyed this little segment to the log and I will talk to you guys oh well so here is the finished makeup along with the hair I love it this is a glam that I was talking about I just finished filming the don't rush challenge finished looks so cute I had this little two-piece on sorry I didn't film the behind-the-scenes for that I am racing against the clock because it is five-o I'm gonna get this picture done start filming the hall and then we could do some tic TOCs let's go outside and take these pics  okay so I'm Midway filming my trying haul that's why my hair some nests like going in and out of outfits but this is the second outfit that I'm gonna take pictures in today my new shoes from shoe dazzle they're so cute literally adorable so I'm gonna brush my hair through some side part action but obviously not this messy and now this camera is actually dying so I'm actually gonna charge day so while I'm doing that and filming just cuz I'm kind of in a rush with the Sun setting and I'm coming back to film man so yeah I will show you guys the pictures on my iPhone in a bit okay so I just got back from taking my pictures I really like that I don't know if it's just one of those days or it's like being back in my old house like I remember it being a struggle to take pictures I might sound crazy but it really makes a difference in LA when I take my picture just like the aesthetic and like the lighting and just everything right now I'm not getting that so we'll see we'll try in a few days maybe I'll ask my brother or dad to help me instead I'll probably offer my brother to like pay him or something I know he hates seeing my pictures but he knows how to take them good like he took them in LA and he did a pretty good job so we'll see I've been showing my mom how to take them like I've been angling it for her but it's just different you know when someone is just used to it and like has an eye for it it's different when they take your pictures you know what I mean see I really like the hair like this brushed out I'm going to finish up filming now and then go eat dinner okay guys so I finally wrapped up my last outfit super cute and I'm going to show you the behind the scenes later I'm gonna try and attempt to take some pictures here with this outfit on my bed we're gonna try it with my phone we're also gonna try it with this camera I'm gonna see if we can make it work and if I could try and post today but yeah it is dinner time so I'm going to show you my mom made today it's been so nice having home-cooked meals and she's been cooking a lot because she knows I miss her cooking we've gone out and got like fast food or take out a few times but we've been trying to cook I know they're gonna go grocery shopping now because we're running low on some things and they say that this week's gonna be really about it so my family doesn't really want to be shown because everyone's just bumming it and Quarantine so I'm gonna show you the food and everything and I'm gonna tell them that on my phone because I'm gonna let my camera charge and I will see you guys in a bit okay tell the dark but my lights gonna change off so I'm gonna set up my phone and everything and see how the pictures look on my phone first I'm gonna put you guys over there so that you can kind of see how I take pictures of myself when I'm alone and we're gonna see how they look and then if I don't like them or just either way I'm probably gonna see how they look on the camera just to compare and then whatever ones better I'll continue taking them on so first things first go on my camera turn the flash yeah it's a very mediocre and not just of course I was imposing like perfectly but the lighting like I just have a feeling my camera is gonna snap yeah for sure so alright guys I'm gonna set this camera up over there pretty much the same concept on my phone except I'm using my camera instead and I jus self-timer I actually I'm gonna download the Canon app because I can do a little remote on my phone so I just got done taking the most home ever like wow I'm gonna be using my camera a lot more often because I'm shook so now I'm going to just leave you guys here and film some behind the scenes in mid you know if you tick tocks I think like three and then I'm gonna call it a night well not really but call it a night for the content it's about eight o'clock now so I'm gonna finish these tic TOCs hopefully I'll be done by like 9:00 9:30 and then I'm gonna go downstairs I'm gonna edit and all that kind of stuff but you hope you guys okay I'm gonna show you guys behind the scenes of one tick-tock so I write down in my notes different ones that I want to do I wanted to this one right here okay so basically my phone and I'm gonna set because what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna voice-over the beginning half in the end half and then the middle of it I'm gonna have my Instagram feed going through so you know this is a real sassy ones like so then I'm just gonna practice I'm gonna cut it off where exactly I'm gonna cut it off so I kind of just annoyingly let it replay over and over again until I'm ready to start filming so the whole point of this annoying repetitive boundary playing is so that I could hopefully get it in 1 2 3 takes and that's it when I first started meeting tic TOCs I would literally spend like an hour on one and now I'm kind of just trying to start getting in the hang up like cranking them out so that's what I'm gonna do right now the light is dying I have another one of the batteries for the light charging this light is the best light that I have so I'm kind of just working with it but you have to show people what I look like and they go to my page look at what I look like let's compare them because I'm not doing this anymore all right I want to try one more time because I like a combination of them both so I'm going to try and do what I did in both in one if not if it takes more than one try that's it like we're done we're wrapping it up imagine being my ex-boyfriend and you have to show people what I look like and they go to my page sometimes it's worth it ok now I want to show you guys the finish result in a little update my phone's dying I'm letting my phone in my light charge so annoying I mean cookies I'll show you guys when I go downstairs my parents went to bj's which is like an East Coast version of Costco basically but yeah I want to do two more tick-tock really tired all I want to do is hop in the shower and take this makeup off but I'm not gonna do my makeup for another like 4 days so might as well just stock up and then that day that I do my makeup I can do even more tic TOCs it's like a tic toc algorithm I've noticed like you have to post like 3 times a day so I'm trying I'm definitely not gonna be at that point maybe when I get back to LA and life goes back to normal I will but I don't know it normally doesn't take this long but all the technical difficulties so I'm gonna do two more both my parents are downstairs watching TV so I'll bring yours downstairs with me but I'm not really gonna talk what I'm gonna go downstairs and do and import everything all of these clips to my laptop import my picture to spend some time with my family watch stuff it's pretty much what I do and then before I go to sleep today I am going to edit and schedule my fashion overhaul because I need to send it to my fashion over representative for approval so I'm just gonna do that so I could go to sleep and wake up and hopefully it's approved tomorrow to go up tomorrow if not I would have to edit and upload a whole different video but I'm feeling good so I'm gonna go downstairs and do all that but before I do I'm gonna finish my cookies and I'm gonna move my clothing rack back here where you're sitting right now I'm gonna tidy up my room a little bit let me show you guys my Murphy packages ignore the back but thank you so much to mark because I am now a part of their glam fam so you can use a my coat glam fam five to seven to get money off your morphe purchases I'm so so so excited and honored to be a part of the glam fam I'm excited to create more look and we're seeing both of these packages this week is making me so inspired to play with color and to do some makeup tutorials so hopefully I can have some for you guys in the next month but yeah this was the first package they sent over I did not know they were gonna send to like thanking you guys so much so this is the Jaclyn hill palette vol 2 you guys you've been watching my makeup videos I'm like last year you would know I'm obsessed with the original Jaclyn hill I actually need to get another one of those because I broke a few of the shades on accident when I was traveling but look how stunning this is like I love this and it definitely is way more pretty in person like the pictures are mine do not do it justice seeing it in person I'm like wow like this section right here I'm really excited to play with it and it is unique I mean definitely if you are someone that likes to play with color I don't think it's like an everyday palette necessarily and this might be but know if you're a makeup artist or you just like to play around this is definitely for you and then they sent me two lip liner I don't know if this is I pencil this one white and then this one's the lip pencil and sweet tea which I've heard so much about actually and then they gifted me their gel liner a sponge they're sponges are some of my favorites so yeah and then this super cute box and then the second package came and I was literally shook because I was not expecting this this made me so excited because the second I saw this probably I was like I need that in my life so I'm so excited so again glam fam five to seven I definitely need to create some content maybe I'll do like a makeup take talk to as well as in makeup tutorial I need us start doing that like where I'll film a YouTube makeup tutorial and then at the same time I'm doing a tick-tock and an IG makeup tutorial we'll see we'll get there but yeah this is the 24 a artist past collaboration with Cellini I love sweety so much she's my girl crush and this was supposed to be their Coachella palette which is so sad but I'm so glad that they still came out with it because this is unreal and this is the perfect palette for spring and summer guys I mean I'm sure you already saw it first of all the mirror yes oh my god I haven't swatch anything yet because I want to do an Instagram video this package and this is another one that when I first saw like a picture of it I didn't realize that there was all this like textured stuff I I literally I don't know I just kind of glanced at it and I was like oh that's pretty but then I saw my friend Victor Vic I'm around do a tutorial with this and I was like oh my god I need that first of all like this chunky star one I want to swatch it so bad but I'll do it Instagram video tonight so I could swatch it after but these glitters oh my god and then of course the mattes to match this is genius and then I love how they have like a deep or any Brown transition and a deep brown and I don't know it's just a really unique palette and I really love it morphe no more because y'all been killing it they sent me two brushes the fluidity full-coverage concealer they sent the white one so this is perfect for like a lid base for this palette specifically then they said their brow setting Jo and their high-impact highlighter in the shade sparked so yeah thank you so much - Morphy for these packages I'm so glad I got to show you guys on this day in my life I'm actually going to chain back into that marble pink and hopefully my phone is a little bit more charge now and especially after I clean a little bit it definitely will be so I can get these talks over with and yeah I'm not going to show you guys when we cleaning because it's literally a disaster but I will bring you downstairs and show you like a brief little clipper to and I'll show you my tic TOCs and the pictures I posted and I can't wait until all that's done way because I just can't wait to take a shower and take this makeup off ok guys so I just finished the tick tock I'll insert some of them here imagine being my ex-boyfriend and you have to show people what I look like and they go to my page to look at what I look like or you have to go to my page there show them what I look like and everybody just pause cuz they're like that's what she look like do let that go oh ok you should a freaking treat it not us petty I have to making them they're just so time-consuming just fine because I'm bored like what else I'm gonna do anyways but I'll be getting frustrated sometimes because I'm like oh my god why is this figured forever but yeah I am about to shower finally in over these lashes ah well the difference I really hope you guys enjoy today's day in my life quarantine edition I tried to make it as fun as possible for you guys and just vlog everything and yet tomorrow I'm literally gonna be editing sittin on the couch to make
