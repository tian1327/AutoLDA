 good morning guys it's Amanda and welcome back to another quarantine vlog I am so happy that you guys have been loving the vlogs as much as I love making them because honestly this is the only thing that I look forward to during quarantine to vlog my day had a bit of a leader start today because I had to catch up on a bunch of work last night but nonetheless we're gonna get ready we're in a productive day all I've done today is brush my teeth and do my skincare I will show you guys all the products that I used but yeah we're gonna go and make breakfast because I'm starving and we're gonna make a green smoothie we'll see what we do but yeah welcome to the quarantine just so you guys know making your bed every morning is one of the seven Habits of Highly Effective People it's a very minimal tasks out of you conquered during the day you can basically do anything so I always make my bed every morning no matter how many days I've been stuck in this house and also once you make your bed the room just feels clean and organized and as I had mentioned to you guys my new mirrors from Restoration Hardware came in I'm obsessed with them these are the Fillies gilt mirrors I'm gonna link them down below for you guys also with the sizes this is the smallest out of like the big long ones and that's the smallest out of the like you know short ones but I think they look perfect in the room and it's just been tying everything in together yeah I'm really happy with how the room is coming in and my bed comes next week so I'm excited about that too so yeah once that's done we're gonna do a room tour so for today's screens smoothie we're gonna be using some kale some spinach celery ginger lemon juice Kiwis we're gonna be using some green apples half a banana some cucumber and a little bit of apple cider vinegar and collagen peptides from vital proteins and we're just gonna pour this up  I'm in the mood to make some oatmeal we're switching it up because we've been doing oval kado toast a lot we're gonna make my oatmeal recipe that I stole from Nicolette because she showed me this recipe at it's amazing so we're gonna start off with some original oatmeal and then we're just gonna put it in this bowl and a trick to this oatmeal to it being like this amazing is that you don't put a lot of milk / water in it I put like almond milk in mine so that's what we're gonna do now we're gonna put it in for exactly 45 seconds I also poured in some honey and I poured in a little bit more of the almond milk just to cool down the oats and we're gonna mix this up since this is the original oatmeal without any flavoring to it I do add honey for flavoring because you know it's a little bland guys this is what literally makes this oatmeal so amazing this is Justin's chocolate hazelnut and almond butter so I put like a spoon forward two of this into the oatmeal and then we add our berries so today we have some raspberries and some zebras and you guys this is breakfast our green juice a ginger shot or oatmeal and some lemon water which was almost ugly     well you guys that is my makeup for today I'm gonna link all the products down below like I always do if you guys want to check any of them out guys I've been loving the cush mascara from milk Wow but also the Grande serum because it's the reason my lashes are so long guys I still haven't taken this I want to take it this is a Seoul ginger shot you had 70,000 milligrams of organic ginger it's two fluid ounces and I'm like mmm we're like halfway there okay hey guys I'm gonna do my hair off camera because it's just gonna be long and tedious but I'm basically just gonna do like little beachy waves I'll probably film a more in-depth tutorial on it in another video you guys tell I've obsessed with my new mirror it's so pretty you guys I can't get over it it literally changed up the whole vibe to the room I'm gonna obviously link them down below there from Restoration Hardware it was a little wider than I expected but honestly it's the perfect size because I feel like it complements the Shelf as well I'm still not sure if I'm gonna keep this here or put it in the closet room because I have an impressions vanity vanity coming in I just feel like the room is finally coming together once my new bed comes and once I get my new vanity everything is just gonna change up for the better I have to do my hair and take a couple pictures for a campaign I'm working on right now so I'm gonna go ahead and do that I've been trying to learn this one tik tok dance for like the past thirty visit I'm still trying it's so hard if I'm not even joking I am sweating like the back of my neck I don't want to talk about it so we're gonna eat some BB q pulled pork and sweet plantain a mesh and I'm just gonna eat this up really quick and I'll be back so this is what the living room looks like right now I'm gonna get another carpet just to fill up that space excuse that sock I don't know why that's there I was doing laundry yesterday but I put a plant there and I feel like it really tied in and makes it look more homey and cozy this is not the final product of the console I'm gonna move this I don't like it there I'm gonna put another plant there probably and keep the blankets there but yeah I'm still kind of lost as to what I want to do with this little corner I'm gonna order a fig plant and see how it looks so like I was saying I was on Pottery Barn and I was looking and they have some really plants and just other things that would look really nice in my house in my room in my living room because I want to make it feel a little more homey and obviously when I moved in I had a very different idea as to what I want now for my house thankfully I love everything like I don't need to replace any furniture but there is things that could be improved I could look better sorry I'm grabbing my lemon water for lunch but yeah thank you guys for the comments about this that I need to get a new water filter I have to order one today actually thank you for reminding me in a weird way cuz I was vlogging I was like thinking about the comments you know but yeah it takes me like a full sixty seconds to fill up my water cup and it's really annoying and like all my friends were like I can't believe you have to do that and I was like I think the fridge is just broken but I spoke to the maintenance guy he was like well you're gonna have to buy another water filter I was like I don't know where to get that I thought you guys did that and he was like no you have to order it yourself like I would help you but obviously this whole thing like I saw him when I was taking out the trash so he was like far from using his golf cart I was like hanging on like I don't know what's going on here so yeah little water filter story time I almost forgot but I also got an Amazon package today that we're gonna open I think it's my juicer which I'm so excited about because I like my blender I think it's great but sometimes there's like some weird textures in there when I put different vegetables and stuff that I don't like but yeah you got it this is lunch it's basically pulled pork and plantain mash and some veggies which I'm super happy about let me try this wow this is really good I'm gonna talk him here but you guys want to check him out if you're in South Florida I want to do meal prep because sometimes I am an overt spender when it comes to groceries and things go bad and I can't even cook them so this is great it's also you know good for dieting and losing weight and not even if you want to lose weight just like if you want to maintain a healthy lifestyle you want to eat clean this is like perfect for you they also send me some cupcakes like Brad velvet cupcakes out we're like made and they were super healthy which was great you're really airy and love them but yeah they deliver me food twice a week and I have a couple of meals throughout the day and also because sometimes when I cook like I make a mess and they're just days where I don't feel like cooking so this is great and I'm not ordering out and like a really unhealthy restaurant so Cheers came in from Amazon my juicer came in I'm so excited I also got these mason jars that's why I just took him out and I got the tops because I wanted to get these for like you little green juices or iced tea depending on you know whatever I'm making these are so cute and you can even use them as decor I'm gonna use them as cups obviously and I'm just gonna put them up in the pantry alright guys so I decided I'm not gonna thumb the play this video today I'm gonna film it tomorrow just because I'm gonna overwhelm myself by doing two videos in one day so I decided I'm just gonna take some time to read I've been reading The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz I am on the second agreement right now I'm like this far into the book this book is amazing and I want to talk about a little bit because I know a lot of you guys don't read I know people don't really do that much but this book is really special to me and it's been very transformative in my life there's so much negativity in this world and this book has really taught me well what are the agreement is be impeccable with your word and that's really transformed my life and the way I view things because what you put out into this world is what you're gonna receive and words are such a powerful thing and that's something I really want to instill in you guys because and I'm not even saying that's because of hate comments or anything anything in your life gossiping talking about other people when you talk about other people you are manifesting when you know your word is a very powerful thing I manifested my life like I knew that I wanted to do this from the start I didn't think I would get there but I put it in my brain you know what I'm gonna put my mind to this and I already have the mentality that I was going to already accomplish it that I was just on my journey there but I knew that ultimately I would get there I had it I believed it and it came true look at the life that I'm living now look at what I'm doing as my full-time career I'm so blessed but one thing that I've learned this book is very figurative obviously it has a lot of different examples and I'm gonna be here all day if we talk about it but the one thing I've learned is to be impeccable with your word anything that you say you know make sure that there is a positive reinforcement behind it because you're going to receive what you give out let's say you're talking about someone and you're saying something like oh this person is this this and that make sure there's a positive reinforcement because that energy is gonna come back to you no matter what you say so I am really trying in my life now to do inventory on friendships people in my life and not on on myself like put myself in check and this quarantine has been great for that I've been working on myself I'm bettering myself as a person no one's perfect we all make mistakes and the one thing I really appreciated is reading this book and I am so mad I didn't read it earlier because I've had this book forever this book was recommended to me by steps dad Robert he's a doctor he's amazing he's a genius and he recommended me this book because we like to read something Richmond and obviously you know and I got so caught up in life sometimes that I'm so busy that I don't have the time to read like I used to I used to read all the time I literally have an oak across from me right now full of books that I used to read all the time but you guys the main message I want to point across because I know the Internet is a very negative place sometimes and it's really dark try and be as positive as possible especially during a time like this um there's a lot of bad things happening and you know the world has enough negativity as it is what I'm saying is just try and be positive be optimistic spread positivity don't speak badly of people because ultimately that's gonna come back to you anyway so I just wanted to say that this book is amazing I will keep you guys updated on what I've been learning from it and you guys should definitely read it I'm gonna link it down below for you guys it's amazing I did have the audio version of this on audible and I would listen to it but you know when you're like just listening to listen I feel like this book has like impacted me so much more in this season of my life and I'm so grateful for it so yeah I just wanted to talk about that really quick um spread positivity be a good person I'm gonna read for a little bit the Sun is kind of going down which is so pretty I might read outside we'll see because the copper tea this guy is right now this guy is like so beautiful right now  garrison Leona me blog I know that Cuba hi she's getting cute for the vlog mommy say hi guys I'm talking to my mom because I haven't spoken to her at all all day so yeah hey guys so I finished reading I also got out of my sweat pants cuz I was getting really hot in here and I changed into some shorts but we're gonna make dinner we're making some Cajun salmon today that's what's on the menu and I'm gonna show you guys basically how to make it it's a crowd favorite in my house and it's really healthy and good for you so
