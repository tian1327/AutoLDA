    good morning everyone I am going to make some breakfast we have some hashbrowns um it kind of got messed up excuse the appearance I have made some poached eggs it's actually like only my second time trying to make it Sampson like his eggs butter this way so I've been trying to learn it but for me I usually just like it scramble and then we have to bacon wash some strawberries and my coffee it is laundry day today you got it you actually do have to get Joe Dirt they're in the drawer  I thought I would show you guys my tanning routine I decided to do a little bit of a self tanner just because I don't know the weather is getting warmer I'm certain to wear like tank tops more and I just kind of want like a nice glow so usually I like using these two I actually also really like using G L'Oreal standing wipes I don't have any on me right now but those are like so quick and easy if you want like a really nice tan overnight but also if I want a darker tan I would use this which is the blondie sand self-tanning mist and dark you kind of just spray this all over but I'm kind of looking for a more gradual tan like nothing too crazy I'm just kind of want like II just wants the beach glow so I'm gonna use it says this is my very beautiul iam off the beach bronzed and it's a self-tanning foam but first I'm actually going to use their primer this is not sponsored you guys I did work with them in the past and I really love their products so I've been using it a lot and it's just really nice I love like the gradual tan which I can show you tomorrow just kind of just like make everything look like super even I guess undo my legs too so I'm just gonna wait like sixty Seconds and if you order this set it actually comes with this mitt which I really like it's also like washable I'm just gonna pump some of this in here it just starts spreading it  start your computations so I just put it all over I usually wait about four hours and then I shower and after I shower and clean my face and all that I'm going to use this this is also from very beauty it is their facial tanning serum and I really like it it just kind of could seem like a gradual tan like yawn and you can use more like throughout the days if you want it's really nice you kind of just do your reduce routine and use this as a serum and then I put on your moisturizer yeah I'm gonna watch some TV and shower in a little bit and I will show you guys what it looks like tomorrow I just finished filming my princess Polly haul that's what all these empty hangers are here but if you're interested in a video that should be out before this blog so I will link it here and down below and look at the mess you guys I mean this isn't that bad honestly but I gotta clean that up and kind of like organize this put that away but I am about to head out right now they just wanted to get some fresh flowers to brighten up the apartment and honestly just like use as prompt because kind of running out of ideas to shoot at home and I just want to make it a little bit different made myself some milk tea this is like my favorite milk tea packets it's the Casa milk a flavored tea and this is what it looks like my friend Emily actually gave me it is so good but yeah I'm gonna head out and grab some flowers and then I'll catch up with you guys in a little bit  all right I just shot the pictures and they turned out super cute I kind of tried to make the flowers match the top that I'm wearing and these are the flowers that I've picked out I think these are daisies and I got some baby's breath too I'm gonna add some water I think I might even cut the daisies a little bit shorter I feel like they're a little bit long but I really like them also last night I did the self-tanner I said I would show you guys what it looks like I don't know if you can really tell but I guess you can kind of tell here its definitely darker than I was I was pretty pale but it's nothing too crazy it's not like a crazy crazy difference and it's not like orangie at all it's just kind of like an olive ish tan which I really like I don't know if you can tell from my shoulders and my chest area definitely a tanner and then for my face I did use the drops that I showed you guys and that it's kind of like very buildable like you don't really see much of a difference from using it just once but if you use it like two days that you see more of a glow I do have like some makeup on so I don't know if you guys can tell but I put it on last night and I put it on this morning that's just like a serum so I'm gonna leave all that stuff down below I put on my story last night a lot of you guys asked me how I like that's Hanna and my process and everything so I hope this helps a little bit see I've been kind of just working all day and it is almost 4:00 now but I kind of wanted to just update you guys on some stuff so last week I was feeling a little bit under the weather I was kind of sick and I was kind of having some symptoms of kovat and I kind of got a little bit nervous I was having like chest pains and chest tightness and a little bit of chills so Samson ended up taking the rest of the week off just in case as a precaution and then we ended up getting tested and the results came back before the weekend and we ended up testing negative and that was honestly just such a huge relief I don't have any of the symptoms now they all kind of went away I'm not sure what it was it might have just been stressed from working on my thesis paper and not getting much rest the week previously so I'm so happy that we were able to get tests is just make sure that everything was okay so yeah if you guys are having some symptoms I would really recommend to get tested if you can I know a lot of places are limited on tests I'm thankfully the place we went to we went to an urgent care I'm sitting empty and they were able to give both the antibody tests and also the swab so we did both and both came out negative yeah I thought I would just update you guys on that because I didn't walk all of last week and I just wanted to let you guys know what was going on hope you guys are staying safe staying healthy taking care of yourself your body your mental health last week because I was having the symptoms I kind of just took a couple of days and just kind of rested and just did whatever and that honestly made me feel a lot better so now I am in such a better place mentally as well my NYU virtual graduation is actually on Wednesday they did send me at like the graduation cap I'll show you guys they did send me this I'm not going to put it on but it says 2020 and I thought that was nice of them to send it over and I'm happy that they're even doing like a virtual graduation alright so I'm going to be some food I'm going to make myself a salad this is like my favorite favorite healthy salad to mate and it tastes so good so I thought I would share with you guys in case you know you want to get in your greens want to make like a quick salad ok so I have this Trader Joe's spring mix and it's just baby lettuces and greens but you can just make your own greens if you want too much try to choose and I usually like using avocado but my avocados aren't ripe yet so I'm gonna use a little bit of my avocado dip for it then I just cut up some cherry tomatoes and some onion and usually I like using chicken breasts this is the one from Trader Joe's and this is just like really quick and easy  what she looks like so good and so quick and easy honestly all right hey pest I get everything so freakin good it's like the best salad I've ever had even like a restaurants and stuff honestly this is my first time using the avocados dip rather than just an avocado and it tastes so good this has Greek yogurt with avocado diced cucumber and a hint of jalapeno pepper  I'm popping this now    just did a quick morning of yoga I've been really loving to do just like a 10 15 20 minute routine in the mornings to kind of just get my day at started honestly I just feel a lot better a lot better when I just stretch a little bit and it's kind of like calm my mind so if you can't or highly recommend you to do just like 10 minutes of yoga but I am going to make some food now I'm going to make myself a quick smoothie do a little taste test so good sometimes I like to do it into a smoothie bowl and then just put some granola and she√≠s eat stuff on top but I'm actually going to make some toast with peanut butter  hello hi find out just working on my Poshmark orders I don't know if you

with you guys too this is my little fruit infused water that I've been trying to drink so much every single day I'm trying to drink like 2 to 3 cups just because I have a hard time drinking water like getting myself to drink water a lot and this honestly tastes so good it's like super super refreshing and all I put in it is I slice up some lemon some strawberry and peaches and usually I love like lemon water that really helps with like my bloating so I added that and then peach is supposed to be really good for your skin and the strawberries are for antioxidants so if you guys want to try balance want to get yourself to drink more water at home but definitely tag me I would love to see your little fruit infused water I love drinking it out of like a little mason jar so cute  you
