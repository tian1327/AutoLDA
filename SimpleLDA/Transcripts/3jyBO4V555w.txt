about that one time that had caught him with two different girls in the same day Oh guys that was a good one that's another time okay hold on let's go back to this first time that I caught him cheating okay first time cuz I was with him for like a million years what happened was I feel like I'm gonna have diarrhea just talking about this I was walking home from school and I had a Bridget with me okay for just one of my good friends I've been friends with her since first grade and I can't get rid of her fine she does watch my videos don't worry about it we were walking into his house he told me to come to his house after school so we're walking over to his house and I had a candy for him because I'm sweet and we come up to the gate the gate is locked his sister is on the other side of the gate and she pops her head up hey um what's that oh my gosh it's hideout here you want something a drink come on in and I'll get you soda we're like let's go inside like where the Frick is this guy usually his car is parked in the back and his car wasn't there so I go inside and I'm like oh where is he at she's like I don't know that's I have no I have no clue maybe we should wait for him so then I'm like I'm gonna go put this candy on his pillow because I'm a nice girlfriend so I'm coming up the stairs instantly go blind instantly lost my vision don't know what happened the Lord was like you can't handle what you're about to see so I'm gonna make you blind I literally couldn't see anything I just knew that they were in bed together I'm not sure if there any because I was blind I just was like drop the candy on the floor took off running down the stairs oh my god there's so many up there there's a girl up there then his sisters like it outta here oh my a marsh back up there to frickin kick the door open they're still sitting there like like I wasn't just freaking there I'm like it was not my house it was his mama's house and I was running like behind her so we're like running down the stairs and I'm like running and yelling at the back of her head like anyways I chased her all the way out the door then he comes out after and then he meets me in the downstairs restroom and I just saw a being because I'm so embarrassed my friends there this happened in front of his sister I'm just crying unconsolable uncontrollably I forget what lies I believed in that moment but anyhow his mom end up getting home from work and she drove me home to my house and I lied to my mom sorry mom and lied to my mom that my friend died yeah my mom definitely watches this sorry lie to you mom that's literally what happened and that's why I was crying I can't be telling these stories this late cuz I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack I need to calm down anyways just a little juicy nugget at the end of the video these are inappropriate to be telling when my son's awake okay guys give me a break you're still editing my videos and I'm texting Carly at the same time just kind of letting her know where it emotionally just like mentally I guess because I feel weird I've been feeling really weird and I don't want to say that it's depression but I've been feeling that way a lot it's honestly put me into this funk that I'm really trying to get out of and that's why I'm staying as busy as I am with everything that I'm doing that's part of the problem I'm like an octopus who doesn't want to be an octopus earlier today I snapped at Jude for saying that he was bored I know he's bored and I'm trying my best to work around his schedule and then I edit these videos when he's sleeping but I feel like I'm dying it sounds so dramatic I honestly think that I'm going to segue into story times versus doing daily vlogs so that I can rest I have an obsessive personality where I overthink I over worry and I personalize a lot of things so I keep talking about those guys because I'm not going anywhere so sorry if I digress I take it personally when my videos don't do well because I feel like I suck and I know I'm not the only content creator that feels that way I'm just saying it out loud because this is like this is literally a video diary a video blog of my life of my feelings of my experience during this quarantine life and I hope that you guys can be flexible and patient with me during this time I don't want to complain to you guys either but that's just where I'm act only reason why I keep pressing forward with a smile on my face is because of you guys when I read those comments of how much you guys look forward to seeing these vlogs every day I'm like I could do it I could do it how many people can say thousands of strangers watch their videos from all over the world all over the world okay I've never had this many friends in my life I love you guys
