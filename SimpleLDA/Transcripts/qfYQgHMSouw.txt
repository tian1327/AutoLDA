otherwise situation Oh fire man yeah it is and this is Smith and night so I actually see some of the sights over in 34th endeavour square x square 5th Ave 6f like those busy areas hardly anyone is out you see a couple of people Hell's Kitchen desert man I was not here to experience the whole 9/11 thing which is what everybody is comparing the deserted miss to I wasn't here during that time I was in I was actually in class however we were exactly where I was and everything that happened that day but I wasn't here to experience in New York after that because I know it was towers that went down a lot of power was out a lot of people wasn't out at that time I remember saying all the chaos on the news but I wasn't here to experience the actual event but here there we're on our way to pet care get that done that's how busy it is right now you can ride your bike up a one-way did I say busy I don't even know what I meant to say that that's how empty it is don't judge me no cars no traffic whatsoever at this time this whole thing will be filled with all right somebody to pick here but I would bleep it   that's great they got every flavor micros releases you're on the phone anybody else take a picture of their grocery list and like keep on falling like that or do you type it in your phone or you just write it on paper and where you can go search for Blakey I just take a picture of it just on my refrigerator in this particular like that got my baking bit straighter cheese tasting salsas tomato and applesauce my way back to the house unfortunately I could not find the K so let's try to go to a different grocery store and on top of that didn't realize that I don't even have tortilla chips anyway another grocery store right now I don't know why the only people that I'm seeing the Bronco cancel everybody really wants why why how do you like  okay so all right you go salsa right here that'll sit at you but you guys just not have block okay so okay so like it's queso and salsa you do not have any more cases mark pijl all right thank you you too no idea why people are so much on dadgum block okay so you know this is a crying shame dadgum shame I want to go so another grocery store you know what's crazy is that I really don't see people buying a lot of queso right now I can't find out a dadgum joke all right maybe back to the house oh my goodness first of all I am blogging but not bringing my scarf it was great weather earlier though plus I did not think I was going to be out this long a man is getting back to it out there walking around looking for queso looking for Blanc okay so ridiculous and you know something else you people who are shopping for black okay so are so selfish because he was not shopping for it before cold before this whole coronavirus hit but now you want to be out buying you don't want to chill makes no sense anyways on to knowledge news I did not get the Ezekiel 4:9 I ends up doing the Genesis 1:29 bread it's still a really good bread this is how you know bread is a healthier brain when you have to put it in the freezer or just a pretty cold temperature to keep it up that's how you know if you can sit braid out and it's lasting for like weeks and weeks and not molding then you know that it's not healthy bread more than likely I'm going to have a salad and I may do some chicken tenders or something I don't we'll see I'll put up this stuff I'm thinking about going to another grocery store talking about this in this case why I don't know if I should eat shower then sit my butt down or shower eat and sit my foot down either way Oh   guys will not believe what just happened I'm not even sure if you caught it or not let me just show you let me just show you look this guy's this sale this is my vlogging camera and my photography camera yeah it may look like it's simple to click back oh honey I don't know if you guys can see this but see this little black thing it's like two of these pieces if you can see they have broke off here one here one here and I want to say one here too but you can do that thing you can see it oh my gosh it won't go back on there like cuz I was about to repeat the mess out of this and just have some rubber bands to hold it up but it won't even record anymore so this it's kind of done I am gonna see if I can salvage it get it repaired mmm I tell you on the fourth day of daily vlogging this happens it's my fault it's my fault it fails from the top of the refrigerator where you last saw me you know cooking and stuff and this is my phone I am now on my phone now so I'm good I'm good though I'm good Oh continue cooking and apparently we're going to quickly close out this block I don't know what I'm gonna do now but I'll be back all right you guys I'm back and this is a dinner the salad is pretty good of course the rice tastes pretty good and of course the chicken tenders pretty good I don't know about you guys but do you guys ever keep like these sauces from whenever you go out to eat or like have takeout or to go or whatever do you ever cute this is my I keep these because they come so in handy like who's really buying a whole container of honey mustard not me as far as this camera situation goes honestly I'm not even sure what I'm going to do I know I look completely like an idiot because my eyes is like here because the whole screen is here I'm looking at myself but I have to remember that there's a little bitty tiny little circle thing over here's where you guys are hey what's up do you guys know how much this camera cost about $700 I want to say it is a little less than it like a little bit because I also purchased a warranty which the warranty is out on it right now I think I've had this camera for probably about I want to say probably about two years I mean it's like okay but not okay because honestly I'm not making money from YouTube right now so technically this investment that I did with this camera it's not paid off yet that's what kind of bothers me but hopefully SquareTrade can repair it which I'm pretty sure they can they definitely did a very very good job repairing it once before when the whole bottom was like chip off I don't know I didn't do it I didn't do it but they repaired it unfortunately I'm just gonna have to pay for it this time because it's out of warranty my mom was probably gonna be shaking her head because I'm not going to tell her what happened to this camera but she just now found out no she didn't pay for it I did but I know she's still shaking her head buddy what's gonna go ahead and close out this vlog because obviously I want to keep blogging on my phone and just stay tuned for what tomorrow is gonna bring because I honestly don't even know what I'm gonna be vlogging with or if I'm going to vlog even want to continue these daily vlogs but just know that you're dealing with a go-getter and whenever I want to do something I do it so we just gonna see how I'm gonna do it tomorrow arises arising arising to the highest we show what we show out with a broke camera but still stay - but what's next I love you guys   taken
