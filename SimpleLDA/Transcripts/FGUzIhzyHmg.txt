    hey guys there by me I'm just grabbing a cotton round today we're vlogging okay I have no idea what this video is going to be about why our bottles that pump out products by pushing down so satisfying nail polish remover skincare what else comes out like this I don't know I think it's genius though last week I put on purple and nail polish with glitter it ended up looking like super chunky and I got over it in the first day now it's impossible to take off I feel like I've been kind of ni√±a during this quarantine I don't even mean to be the days just keep passing by if you ask me what I did yesterday I wouldn't even remember let's go potty and give you a clear answer but I'm like filling up my days doing random things oh my god let me tell you what I've been doing i've been playing Animal Crossing Phineas actually got me this switch light about like a week ago he basically started playing before me and was like you need to get on this you would love this bought me the switch because I didn't care enough to do it myself it was supposed to be a real bonding experience but all it's done is just made this time even lonelier because we just go off into our corners and play this game but I hope you guys are doing well I hope your families are okay and staying safe and sane so there's a few that I screenshotted that I liked the first run being things you've done in quarantine we covered that I've definitely not been reading as much as I hoped I would I don't I'm so weird about reading because when I'm doing it I love it so much and I can go on for hours but it's so hard for me to pick up a book and set the time aside like if we're going to bed too late in the night then I don't want to start reading and then I never want to do it in the middle of the day I don't know I'm terrible at reading but the book that I've been reading acid for the children which is a memoir by flee from the Red Hot Chili Peppers this book has been so much fun to read he is just so descriptive with his writing this is his first book I think it is but it's incredible it's rich it's hilarious it has crazy stories in it I'm like finally getting into the point of the book where he starts getting older and apparently he just gets into so much crazy I mentioned this on our podcast which by the way I hope you guys are enjoying our podcast we're three episodes in can you show us your island on Animal Crossing yes for starters this is my little character this is my house I'm right next to a little private pond we've got a little rainbow hammock this is my private beach I didn't even realize that I moved in close to this little beach but we really took advantage of it oh wait let's go inside my house here's the main room it's still pretty empty because I am figuring out what I want to do with it I haven't really unlocked a lot of furniture yet it's fragrance sticks I made a succulent I love these walls and stone flooring I think it's so cute we've got some books there I have a purse hanging and I want to build more cherry blossom stuff I was given this crazy flooring that looks like clouds it's really awesome it kind of looks cooler in the main room but I figured like a cloudy bedroom is really dreamy still need to change the wall out of bed and that's the bedroom gorgeous really really loving this main room very cute I've definitely like plop flowers everywhere to make it look cute I have a lot of trees over here for gardening I have a lot of palm trees everywhere Tom Nook still lives in a tent like that is how early I am in this game right now I am assembling plots for my new residence so you have to put like furniture on the outside that it asks for and on the inside so we have two there and I really like these little tables that they chose very obsessed with my little area my little beach party it's so cute okay that's all what's the first thing you're gonna do when this quarantine is over when this sort of period of it ends I think the first thing that I'm going to be the most excited about doing probably just visiting my friend's house I think we're probably still gonna be pretty iffy about going to like public restaurants and stuff and I'm sure they're not gonna be like full capacity allowing you know customers to come in but I think just going over to friends houses and having people over I miss that the most I miss like you know having that person-to-person energy and connection what shows are you watching at the moment don't say Tiger king lol we just finished watching Barry at which I started last year there's only two seasons out right now but we finished the second season and it is so crazy its season 2 episode 5 I promise you watch through the entire show just so you can get to episode 5 of season 2 because it is a masterpiece it is like a short film on its own so crazy so funny do you see yourself getting married in the next five years probably I mean I'm 24 I'm gonna be 29 in five years I've always wanted to start but well I'm like almost done with my nails that look at that I've told myself for a while that I want to start having a family and like my early 30s around 30 or something so I think that checks out don't get excited the biggest thing you've learned about yourself from being in a serious relationship well it's really easy for me to get sucked into whatever is happening in front of me and in the moment and so sometimes I kind of have to like sit myself down and be like alright you need to do these things that are just for you that you need to go off and do alone or you need to go off and do with your friend or something I kind of think everyone experiences that I think it's really easy to get so sucked into each others worlds and so involved in that circle of what you guys share but making sure that you're kind of like hitting everything else that was in your life before that person I am NOT the best at that so that's something that I've learned and I don't beat myself up for that because it's a huge part of my life and a huge part of my future and so putting sort of the love and time and attention in that is really important to me but I think like finding a better balance I could always improve in favorite album at the moment well The Strokes came out with a new album I think today any I've been listening to it all morning and I love this joke so much oh my god so I'm definitely going to be listening to that a ton what's kept you sane during quarantine my answer for that is definitely going outside of course making sure that you're taking every safety precaution you know wearing a mask avoiding others six feet distance all that stuff I think going outside has like really given us some sort of normalcy to our schedule and routine and just not feeling like cooped up and we're definitely grateful to be living in a city that has a lot of room for us to do that because I can only imagine how stressful it would be to live in like a city like New York or something I feel very grateful to be living in a place that has great weather and lots of space for everyone to kind of walk around and get that nature in if you have that and you're living in the suburb don't take it for granted go outside give yourself some fresh air are you more on your phone these days I'll just say like technology in general so we're talking like Nintendo switch cell phone laptop and TV I'm definitely on technology more than I'm comfortable with and I'm used to being on kind of makes me feel a little shitty but at the same time I've always kind of dreamed of moments where I'd have more found time to do things like watch maths or classes like right now I'm watching Anna Wintour's she's just like a powerhouse of a woman so it has been really interesting I finished Natalie Portman's on acting and that one was great oops my camera died as far as technology goes I've just been trying to be a little bit more mindful about what I'm taking in and what I'm watching and what I'm doing not that Animal Crossing is like the most productive thing in the world but just knowing like how many women friends are doing it right now it feels like this weird communal thing that like we're all kind of doing what have you been making for breakfast during quarantine I've been making a bunch of pancakes chocolate chip pancakes out of peanut butter jelly sandwiches oh wait we're talking about breakfast well I do do a lot of like banana peanut butter on toast situation lots of tofu scramble that's delicious makes that that's his own thing favorite hobby to work on in quarantine the one thing that I really really wanted to sit down and learn this month was Photoshop I can't believe I've been on YouTube for ten years and have never downloaded Photoshop you guys don't know how I've been making my thumbnails PicMonkey Chris Clemens came for me I was ashamed but I want to watch more videos on how to navigate Photoshop I feel like I'm going to thrive and love it once I figure it out right now it's very confusing what is the best thing that has happened to you since being in quarantine better sleep schedule which honestly kind of has nothing to do with what's going on right now but we've been just been giving ourselves like a full night of rest every single night we're lucky to be able to stay at home and work from home we're lucky to be healthy and going to bed every single night okay those are the questions huh oh my god and he has recently purchased two paintings he wants to start collecting paintings which I fully support did was this one made here in Los Angeles this one right here yes thank you let's go see it should we open it yeah  I love that   plant mom here I was just watering the pine to my office and my birds-of-paradise  let me be petty for a second a lot of you guys said that it would die out if I kept the broken stones it's thriving I haven't cut off any of the stems there's so much new growth didn't realize it until today and I'm really stoked now because that means that I'm doing something right so I'll show you guys in a second but I have been propagating one of my pot those plans because the one in her living room on the fireplace grows like crazy I keep just cutting off little vines today I realize that this one has crazy long roots I mean it's been in this cup for like a month or something and I've been switching out the water so you see that root and then there's some down there we are going to transfer this to a pots I probably should be potting it in a plant that has like drain holes at the bottom I don't have one so I'm just going to plant it in here and just sort of hope for the best we've got some indoor potting mix I've watched a few YouTube videos and know that when you're switching a plant from water to soil to make the transition easier you want to make the soil really wet made sense in my mind oops get her all moist I do have some liquid plant food that I might also pour in here or maybe like the next time I feed it really boost this buddy's self-confidence and encourage him to grow that looks good to me I've purchased a bunch of these little pot stands from different places like Etsy for a lot of my plants because I like the look of them and it's kind of like protecting the wood knowing that there was height added this guy definitely was never this tall this stem was one of the broken ones this one right here is growing so fast this is the one that I didn't notice for so long but this is new growth that one is entirely new growth so those who are huge and new we've got a bunch of little growth happening down here they don't get as much Sun so they're kind of barely holding on but a bunch of growing down here most important thing is it's really filling out which is kind of insane I'm so excited this aloe plant is growing like crazy I keep having to rotate it because it keeps growing towards the Sun this one up here has been growing a bunch as well oh my god I'm such a proud plant owner a ton of new leaves on this one as well these are new this one is new as well it's still like uncurling hi I'm filming this
