 good morning Lena Mama's a spirit and I'm the fellow Chi Mayer in de cortes to check out downtown Chicago safely to see how much has changed since quarantine as they confound as we approach the city we took the Lakeshore Drive exit and quickly noticed that the roads were surprisingly empty the first place we wanted to investigate was a museum campus  so it read passing by thought you see him campus but we couldn't even enter the road so we had to keep driving we decided to keep going and checked out the next Chicago landmark on our itinerary maybe peer we had similar scenery we decided to keep driving to see if any of the other Chicago landmarks were open or while we were on the road we noticed something I gotta say there is a surprise there are some people that are ghosts but for the most part it seems like it's just people that are exercising streets are much more they are easier to navigate except for the landmarks that is everywhere we went streets were closed or doors were locked but what really brought the point home was the financial district our single person insight well that was a look at downtown Chicago I gotta say it is a much more eerie feeling when you're actually there as opposed to seeing it all on camera so it is more shocking in person I guess we can only hope for things to get better you're on out stay safe stay indoors have a good morning
