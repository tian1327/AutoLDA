 okay so today is Friday March 27th this is the two week mark of me not working my my last scheduled job was actually on the 16th but both I had two jobs scheduled for that day and they both canceled and I just have not gotten a job since then I'm not sure if it's the same for you guys but New York is on pause is what they're calling it where essentially everything is closed except for essential businesses so we haven't been doing much we have definitely been drinking a lot of coffee though so we are brewing some right now both the agencies that I work for have put out these webinars about working from home and doing depositions from home I haven't seen any more come out of it yet and I hope it does soon because if you don't know as a freelancer you don't get paid if you don't work and I have not been working in for two weeks so fingers crossed this starts happening soon pora definitely approves of the extra pets she's been getting so this is what my boyfriend's been doing for the past week how long has it been out for the past week I also have my own copy of animal crossing to play but I'm waiting for the coral version of the switch light to come out before I start so in the meantime I've downloaded The Sims 4 again and I've been playing the heck out of it we are still doing ok food-wise we still have a lot of fresh veg we've got you know broccoli bok choy cauliflower kale that's Chinese broccoli over there carrots peppers Pease we've got their celery down there so we're doing pretty good in the food department also stocked our freezer pretty well with these hose and vegetable Glens and fruits and stuff and let me not forget we are stocked on teas and coffee is it the only - no teas and I bought a green tea because I don't have any green tea that's in a bag left so I got this one which is orange passion fruit Jasmine and then I got a hibiscus tea I actually really like the Wegmans brand hibiscus tea but we don't have a Wegmans around here so I got the simply balanced one from Target or has very hibiscus it's it's pretty good it's not as good as the Woodman's Brandel I also want to mention that there's so much unnecessary packaging on this it's like a double box for some reason I'm not sure why or who designed it that way but this is a perfectly fine box on its own the only thing we've been really running low on is hand soap we've gone to CVS Walgreens Duane Reade all of them and they don't have any available but that was about a week ago so we're gonna check Target today and hopefully they have some available we also ordered some on Amazon but they keep pushing the shipment back we're supposed to come this past Wednesday and now it it got pushed I think to next week or the following week so yes  I've also been working on my little scrap travel journal I'm pretty far behind this is from our rocky mountain trip in September but finally able to get some work done  you
