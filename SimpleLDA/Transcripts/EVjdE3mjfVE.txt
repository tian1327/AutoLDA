 hi guys so today's video is a bunch of clips from about a week ago to two weeks ago um but before the video got started i wanted to quickly highlight a video um from zoe amira um it is about an hour long video and all of the ad revenue from this video is going to be donated to the black lives matter movement um it's being donated to various organizations and charities and all you have to do is play the video and the money from the ad revenue um will be donated and so i just wanted to talk about that before the video got started um i think it is such a genius idea so a big shout out to zoe i'm looking my screen because i keep forgetting her name um but a big shout out to zoe amira for creating this video it also i believe it highlights black musicians throughout the video because there's music playing throughout and i think it is just a very small and very easy way to make an impact and contribute especially for those who might not have the financial means to donate or might not have the means or the ability to go out and protest right now so i just wanted to put this at the beginning of my video um to share her videos so um make sure to play her video turn off any ad blockers make sure the ads play all the way through it's it's a bunch of music you could just put it on your computer or your phone and just you know go about your day listening to music um and i just i think it's genius so again i will leave that video link down in the description below and now on to your regularly scheduled vlog hey guys welcome to today's vlog it is monday and it is like 7 30 at night um so the kids are just finishing up dinner and then we're gonna start getting ready for bed i got these for the kids new kindle chargers and they came in a pack of two one purple one blue they are constantly losing their kindle chargers and then they're fighting over them like this one's mine no you lost yours this one's mine and now that i've started using my chargers and my like kindle and um camera charger look the exact same as theirs and i'm just sick of them stealing them so i got these for them so that the way they know whose is whose they are responsible for their own chargers they also match their um other gadget stuff and uh yeah so i forget how much they were they look really nice quality um i think they're maybe like 10 to 12 for two um usually when i get chargers on amazon i either get the ones i get the ones with the longest cord for the cheapest amount these ones have a six foot cord so it was the longest cord but i know you can find cheaper chargers um i just got these ones because they have they came in a two pack with two different colors and as soon as i saw that i was like that's perfect so they won't mix them up no more fighting i mean there probably will still be fighting but trying to make as little fighting as possible so that's my most recent amazon purchase um my husband fixed our dryer by the way if you saw last week's vlog so we have a dryer again yay um so now i have a ton of laundry to work on because even though i was getting it done last week and i was hanging stuff up to dry it was still taking like three times as long to do laundry since i had to hang it up to dry um and now we have a dryer so now i gotta play catch up so that's it for now and i'll see you guys in a bit hi guys so i did my makeup and filmed a couple like sit down videos today um but i recently placed a grove order and it just came in the mail it says stay healthy justine they always write like directly on the box and i think it is so i don't know just like nice and personalized um but we were running out of miss myers cleaning sprays so i got some more um i also got this toothpaste it's the children's strawberry toothpaste from toms this does not have fluoride in it by the way um my daughter is like so picky with her toothpaste she thinks all toothpaste is hot um even like normal strawberry flavors or bubblegum flavors or fruit flavors that you would just like i don't know like the more mainstream um brands of toothpaste she thinks a lot of those flavors are too hot even though they're kids toothpastes but this tom's strawberry one uh she likes and um it is fluoride free but i figure this is better than nothing um because she refuses to use anything else so i picked i picked that up picked it up i put that in my order um and then something else that i saw that was new is this seventh generation disinfectant spray and this actually came in three different um scents i got the lavender lavender vanilla and thyme scent um and i have not been able to find disinfectant spray anywhere um they also had disinfectant wipes but the disinfectant wipes were like very small packs so i just skipped on those um yeah we've been like i haven't been able to find like a lifestyle spray anywhere so when i saw this on their side i immediately picked one up and yeah i guess we'll see maybe i should spray try spraying it now just to see how it smells since it is scented i spray the handle on my daughter's laundry basket right here oh that's very the time sentence in this is like very strong like it literally smells like fresh thyme i was expecting it to be more like the lavender vanilla side i i don't smell lavender or vanilla all i smell is the time but yeah if you're in need of disinfection spray they do have this on um grove's website they also had two other scents and then i got some ms meyer sprays six i only ordered five i guess i ordered six um but i got fresh cut grass this is a grow exclusive i love this scent so much um it's one of their spring scents so i'm i'm guessing that as soon as they sell out of this um it's it's going to be gone for good and i think the only reason it's still on their side right now is because it hasn't sold out and then i got mint oh no wait this one's basil this is my favorite like non-seasonal scent it smells so so good it's like i don't think it smells like basil like fresh basil i think it smells like very like kind of sweet but not too sweet not like floral or fruity or anything um it's just a really nice scent i don't know i'm like really bad at describing these things then we have rose which um i don't know i have been liking the rose since not the rose the floral scents this year um usually i'm not a huge fan of the floral scents i've been liking them more this year so i got that one um i got lilac again this is another spring scent oh i got honeysuckle this is my other favorite scent that is this is like my second favorite non-seasonal scent basil is my first favorite non-seasonal and this one is my second favorite and it is this one is floral but it's like it literally smells like wildflowers it's so good and then i also got lavender which um i don't usually like lavender scents but lately lavender scents have been growing on me which like i did get this seventh generation it's lavender vanilla i don't know lavender scents have been growing on me lately and i've been liking them so i decided to try the lavender miss myers and yeah that is everything that i ordered from their site i just needed to stock up on the miss meyer sprays i bought like a bunch of spring scents i think i think i bought like six maybe i even bought like eight bottles of spring cents um and we currently are down to our last two and both of them are almost out so just wanted to stock up um because i mean we use these all these times all we use these all the time especially right now um i've just been like constantly wiping down surfaces um so we've been going through them pretty quickly so wanted to stock up and yeah just share i do have like a grove um like refer a friend link i'll put it down below and basically if you use that link you get like a free like i think a free five piece gift set on your first order um so i'll leave that link down below if you guys are interested i think i get like ten dollars off my next order if you use that as well um because like i said it's like a refer a friend link so we both get we both like benefit from it um but yeah this grove doesn't sponsor me they don't know who i am um if you want to know more about their website i have like a a big inclusive video from a few years ago letting you know how grove works um because you can set up like um you can get like memberships and you can set up subscriptions and stuff to it if that's something you're interested in and so i explain all that in that video i'll also link that down below and yeah i'm so tired i don't know if you guys can tell but i'm like um i'm running on like four hours of sleep which i know some people can do that i cannot do that so i think i'm gonna um take a little rest and yeah i will show you guys the caterpillars if you saw last week's vlog um i got the kids some caterpillars so you can watch them turn into butterflies and they are currently turning into chrysalis i think by the end of the day they will all be chrysalis so i will show you those later and yeah that's it for now hi guys so i just got a package in the mail um i ordered some shorts from target because i only have one pair of shorts that fits me that aren't maternity so um a couple days ago target shorts were on sale for 12 each so i got three pairs i think yeah this is only one of the pairs the other two are coming at a later date but i hope they fit um i got them in the same size of jean that i already own from target i got two that are this style um i think one's a darker color and then i got a light colored jeans that's like this and that has like a bunch of buttons and it's high-waisted but the bottoms are kind of fringy um i'll show them to you when they come in but i'm gonna try these on and see if they fit and hopefully they do these are the high rise midi shorts and it says fitted hip and leg smooths and sculpts i don't know these are just i'm like i i can't i'm having a hard time jumping on the mom jean trend um it's just not for me i don't think it looks good on me i like my shorts and my jeans to be skinny like skinny jeans tight fitting shorts that's just what i like maybe i'm still living in like 2012 but that's just my preference um so i was really happy to see that they had this style at target so i'll show you the other two once they come in i think they're actually coming in um in two days my husband's playing video games but let's try these on okay these are actually perfect i'm so glad they fit i'm obsessed because like like i said i didn't try them on i just ordered them online and i went off of a pair that i already owned from target but you know when like you own a pair of jeans or shorts for a long time and they kind of like stretch out i was afraid that like that pair might have like stretched out a bit and that's why they still fit me um so i was afraid these were going to be too small but they are a perfect perfect fit so now i can stop wearing my maternity jeans because my maternity jeans still fit and i've been wearing them lately all right i'm going to take these tags off and i'm actually going to wear these the rest of the day i also really like this light blue color i feel like i don't have a lot of jeans jeans or jean shorts that are this color i usually get like dark blue so when they're like i guess is more like a medium blue they're like a medium blue like this or like a light blue like the other pair i ordered just don't get a lot so yeah i'm obsessed they're also super comfortable and they like since they have like all these buttons and they're high-waisted they just like suck your tummy in and make you look skinny and this is like my favorite i love pants and jeans that have multiple like a lot of buttons like this such as my my personal style and i think it looks like cute when you like tuck the front end of your shirt in or if you want to tie your shirt i just think it looks cute when there's like a lot of buttons okay so that's it for now i'm actually actually that's not it for now i want to show you one more thing that i'm going to be doing right now these are from universal thread by the way um normally 17.99 but i got them for on sale for 12 bucks and then the other thing i want to show you is i have this like yellow box it is super dirty right now um but i have this yellow box that my nanny gave me and she filled it with all of her recipes and she like hand wrote all of her recipes down so that way if i ever want to make something of hers i have it right here and so i want to start writing down all of the recipes that i make put them in here too so that way it won um when i make those recipes i don't have to go searching through my pinterest page trying to find them again and then also like one day if i am too old to cook or if i pass away or something all the recipes are written down and my kids can find them easily if they want to make them and so that's what i'm going to be doing for the next however long it takes i'm going to be writing a bunch of um our like go-to recipes down so yeah all right so here's everything that's all i can think of right now i need to go through like my pinterest and see if there's anything else um but these are just the things that we make a lot of we make them often so wrote it down and i'll be adding as i think of stuff hi guys so it's a saturday another day another pair of shorts all three pairs came in separate sorry i'm fixing my tripod um all three pairs came in different packages which like i understand they probably came from different like um i don't know warehouses but it seems weird that three shorts all from the same brand at target came from different warehouses but anyways these are the exact same ones just different color and these ones have the fringes on the bottom and then i'm wearing this shirt that was my husband's but it doesn't fit him anymore so now it's mine and then i also got a hat let me grab the hat and show you guys all right so this is the hat i got um i mentioned this a while ago i've been really wanting like this style of hat um but i don't wear hair hats a lot so so i was going back and forth for a while on whether i wanted one or not but i found one for really cheap on amazon it was only like 14 bucks um and i love it i think it's really cute my hair's a mess i think it's really cute i kind of want one in black but i think i'm gonna wait first and see how often i actually wear this one before i buy another one so i'm just i'm really not a hat person i have a couple ball caps i have like one sun hat and now this one and i don't know i think it looks so cute so yeah and it hides it hides how greasy my hair is because you can't see right now but i haven't um put in any dry shampoo in a couple days um because i'm just trying to trying to let my hair be healthy um but yeah i'm about to make dinner and there's my little ootd i'm like i feel really cute right now so yeah that's it for now  do   okay so last pair of jeans just came in these ones are the darkest color they're distressed they have like the folded up bottoms but they only have one button and they have a zipper they're not all buttoned up like the other ones were which is fine i do like the style of the other ones better with all the buttons going up but these aren't bad by any means i definitely like the other two better because i just think the buttons just i think it's just flattering with lots of buttons i feel like it sucks it in better but these are fine they're still high-waisted and yeah they're from that same brand universal thread so there is my recent purchase um that came in at three different days but uh yeah so i'm gonna wear these ones today now okay so it is day 15 since we've gotten the caterpillars um they all became chrysalis eight days ago if you look over here you can't really see it through the mesh but we have our very first butterfly hopefully there's actually i think you see it there we go you see it better from far away but there's the first butterfly it's actually like 5 a.m um i woke up because of the baby and the kids will be up in a few hours and they are gonna flip they haven't seen it yet like it just came out within the past couple hours  okay so i just went grocery shopping so i thought i'd quickly share the fun stuff i got this mochi ice cream my walmart hasn't had moki i did walmart grocery pickup by the way my walmart hasn't had milky until just recently they had a bunch of different flavors i went with the green tea and then i got a bunch of these fiber one bars just like stock up on healthy snacks um so i got the brownie ones these like confetti birthday cake ones and then these lemon ones which look so so delicious and they're only 70 calories each and then some frozen shaped mac and cheese for the kids i might make this for their lunch for today and then i've seen a lot of people talk about these yasso bars and my walmart this is another thing my walmart just recently got and so i got the coffee chocolate chip and the fudge brownie i might have one of these after i filmed this because they look really good and then my husband and i have been drinking i've been trying to stop drinking soda so we've been getting these meow energies um because i tried cutting soda cold turkey only drinking water i've been getting headaches so we started getting these to kind of combat like the caffeine issues and then i also decided to try out the walmart ones so i got a giant one of the black cherry because that's my favorite mio flavor also this one's black cherry then i got the berry blast and the cherry limeade if you guys have been around um we've been really into making donuts at home lately and so i got some confetti cake mix some cherry and some lemon frosting and some sprinkles we're gonna have like a decorate your own donuts um one of these mornings so that's the fun stuff i got not everything from the haul but basically just the junk food and the new stuff that we're trying out okay guys so that's gonna be it for today's vlog i honestly don't even know um how cohesive this vlog is gonna be i've been having like on and off migraines for the past couple weeks and so i've just been trying to film like when i can um but yeah i hope you guys enjoyed today's video and i'll see you in the next one bye guys
