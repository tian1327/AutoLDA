 welcome back to my channels so it is part three of this quarantine series that I've been doing I've noticed a trend I will film for a week not film film for a week not film in films now we are on week 7 I believe the last week of April is a blasting of April Wow yes it is any last thing is it the last week of April it's May in two days shocked and let me grab a coffee and I will catch you up on what I've been doing for the past week  I have my coffee here at my last week I threw a fun quarantine birthday party for el sitio I wanted it to be really special because we can't go out anywhere so I got balloons made some banana bread muffins cuz we really don't like to eat like sugary things and then I had a fun like house party phone call with our friend and I found this confetti in my room that we popped it was just a fun little Quarantine birthday party since I've been cooking a ton more I I realized for a long time that my kitchen cabinets were totally unorganized because I never really like set them up for function and I kind of just threw things in when I moved in and I've been here for like four years so I took everything out I reorganized the whole cabinets it took a full day it was really fun and out there super functionable so I can show you now I have a cabinet just for pots and pans is just like my pantry so everything in here is just food and then the next cabinet over is plates cups and alcohol you know for the longest time I was contemplating on buying a food processor every recipe that I wanted to make in the past always involved a food processor so I finally caved in and got a food processor slash slender slash smoothie makers and so far I've made my homemade hummus garlic spread I also made my own salad dressing which is so it's just cilantro lemon olive oil and Greek yogurt which is delicious and it's amazing how many things that you can make that you would buy in the store at home so I've been having fun experimenting with the blender like all the time these are the ingredients that I'm gonna use for this smoothie and do you some kale celery lemon some little berry half banana chia seeds and also gonna put in smoothies ginger nuts  good morning so it's a rainy day and this whole week actually is gonna be pretty rainy until the weekend which is gonna be like 70 degrees so I received a package in the mail from minnetonka and they sent me house slippers because we are spending so much time inside oh yes oh yes here we go I'm gonna be wearing these literally all the time there's something and they're really cute okay so one thing that I've been doing a ton of while staying home more is I have been reading books I like watching TV shows however the problem with TV for me is that I always fall asleep but if you have any like recommendations for series on Netflix or Hulu at Hulu leave them down below but I've been busy reading books so far I have read for a book I'll briefly go over the ones that I've read if you are interested the books that I love are like mystery thrillers I love like suspense and like Brian murder mysteries and things like that pretty much all I read so first book I read was the shining by Stephen King was creepy as hell if you like horror this is horrifying so definitely pick it up if you haven't read it and I read before she knew him by Peter Swanson to be honest it was okay his other book the kind worth killing is so much better so don't read this one read his other book in my opinion the next book is final girls it was a really good thriller and look look who recommended it Stephen King then I just read The Marriage lie this one was a bit more like domestic thriller I recommend if you like a interesting read if you know a good thriller book also let me know because I would totally read it oh my god look by volume I used to play volleyball in high school can I have one in my room that I liked her out so maybe I'll get some swings  the paint my nails I have a whole box of colors that I'm going to choose from and then I'm gonna continue working on the computer polish so I was really organized at one point in my life where I like laid without all the colors but I haven't updated this in forever so I will pick the color from the box  it's a pretty lilac color that I'm going I just finished my nails it's like this really pretty pink color hopefully it'll bring some joy to these dull rainy days but currently I am working on a video editing and I have a little smoothie going on so back to the editing room I go until Cheers I'm gonna make some homemade popcorn I have this beautiful steel pot I'm just gonna put some olive oil I've never done this before so let's see how it go all these seeds in now I'm going to cutter it up and it's  cheers to that it is bully May and right now I'm going to repot my snake plant which we really exciting it's crazy to see how much these trees have grown on my street but summer is around the corner I have all the supplies are ready to go in this gorgeous new pot it's from Target and it was $19 on sale it's actually ceramic it's pretty thin though in the reviews say it breaks sometimes so I have to be extra careful it also has a hole at the bottom so the water can go out and I bought some new potting soil and some fertilizer so let's get started all right this is the final result and it's new I'm loving it it looks so good now let me put it on the Shelf looks amazing I'm obsessed with these pots so got this at Target it's a cutting board I needed a shelf for the space Cougars are pretty heavy and quite large and it wouldn't fit on the radiator and I never turned my radiator it's always off so don't worry about a fire starting but it looks amazing how cool is this all right good morning everyone it is a beautiful day out I think it's probably the nicest day that we've had all year I think it's like gonna mid-70s so I'm going on a little bike ride I'm gonna show you some of the streets uptown I actually haven't been uptown since the shelter in plates order so I'm really curious to see what it looks like up there it's a weekend it's really nice out so it might be pretty busy actually I'll show you what it looks like when I go through Times Square but let's go in the bank  it's a really wild thing to see in real life zero and now we're headed back downtown naked cowboy is still singing naked which is amazing  as weather gets nice in New York City and people start leaving their apartments to enjoy the Sun the city is giving away free face masks for everyone throughout New York City it is required to wear a face mask and you enter shops throughout New York as well as on the street if you aren't maintaining social distance from everyone and we had a lovely bike ride
