 Grande rising a risers  and chastened Onegin now we on our way Remus and not every species do you guys see this what does this say delivered today also see the kid so here is the camera guys the Panasonic Lumix the Zia 70 if you know about this camera let me know if you've used it before obviously I looked up reviews I'm not gonna buy anything that I haven't at least looked up excited so let's go ahead and open this up one hand Jan here Oh using meas needs kind of handy for some things I don't know why I kind of feel like this is a little bigger than mine boy it likely is not especially with my whole lens I got a whole lens to stick out on my man one I'm so excited to now have two cameras just like I said I am going to get my main one fixed if you haven't saw that vlog that definitely will say go back and watch it so you know what that means we will no longer be on the fish I feed your GoPro Hero you're now gonna be lucky and oh my goodness it's good to be like holding a regular camera again oh of course this is different from my main one but still pretty nice GoPro mr. hero it was nice it came in the clutch when I needed you when we needed you and we appreciate your efforts thank you and we will definitely meet again I can't wait to see how this goes like with everything we've been outside oh by the way it's guys outside right now definitely not the business like it started by raining and badgering again I have got to get this daggone thing off so right now actually got some grapes our ghost party party I love one grapes crunch looks like a thing for me so guys tell me what do you think about this camera I know one thing I saw about this camera it's not that great in low-light the g7x is better in low light then this looming however I don't really shoot in low-light a lot of the times like that so that's how come I didn't mind getting this because most of the time I like to shoot when it's daylight especially when I can have great natural light but of course I'm be carrying around different spikes of course in different buildings they'll be shading other things like that so let me know what you think about it I know one thing I'm going to really be careful with this camera and I have nothing that happened to this especially until I get my baby fixed I'm actually not all that hungry right now have you ever felt like you don't know if you're hungry or not I feel like that but I know that I want something hot I want something warm I really want some soup but I don't have any soup I do have beans I can make beans I have vegetables and I'm not a big fan of canned food but I do have this one can of white corn I honestly do not know why I have just can I don't know how I got this can I can do the corn beans and vegetables on the flip note I could go to the store and get some potatoes and some soup but if I go to the store and get some potatoes some soup then I won't make this I will just eat my soup that I got from the store guess what guys oh my gosh you know what I knew I ate it about a week or two ago oh definitely better do some chilli tortilla I don't have tortilla chips oh but I have tortillas but I don't have tomatoes I have onions let me get myself together all right so figured it out for now I'm going to have a snack of peanut butter and jelly sandwich and then I'm gonna finesse my Chilean tortilla with cheese and sour cream and I have salsa boom so I just took this camera at the box I'm going to put this camera on charger for now and I'll be back with you guys all right back in the kitchen I just made some more tea and I'm about to make my sanest chili  I don't know about you guys but I use honey I do not like using the white sugar in my teeth I used to when I was younger but once I started using honey there was no going back funny thing about tea and honey though you should wait for about five minutes to put honey in your tea if your tea is freshly done when it's so hot because honey can actually be toxic if you put it into pot of water is not highly dangerous so I used to but let's just take out three threes like this three I have like a big flat pan so this is well  boy I'm not gonna fold it all the way down because actually they can probably help by the way I know I'm not the only one that puts dishes in the oven I grew up like that if anybody else does that please comment down below if you do or you don't because I find it interesting when people find that so weird honestly wax will be okay it was foggy crispy or anything no going to have to go to the grocery store get some more honey show me the cheese you got going on you're starting to seal it this would be so good on hot dogs - don't worry guys this is not gonna be a repeat of the last time you're not on top of the refrigerator and matter of fact you're thirty on my tripod so don't freak out we got our Sargento cheese and our sour cream they're gonna be key components to finishing this chili and the chili also already has tomatoes in it so that's one reason why I'm not like really raising all that right now all right had to charge up my camera however this is what we have so I guess you could say it's kinda like a taco but it's not beef it's truly you know it's funny as soon as I say which was earlier today that I don't usually film in low light times of the day now I'm filming in a little bit but to be so honest with you the light that you're seeing right now I'm pulling from my TV so real quick I want to show you guys without much refreshing practice on where I am playing piano right now so there's this app that I use is called simply piano no sponsored moment of this at all whatsoever but just showing you what I use and it teaches you how to play the piano so well I love it you can go over as many times as you want you can repeat as many clips as you want they have flashcards I mean they just listen it is your own teacher in a phone without the harshness of an actual teacher so you could be hard on yourself I'm sort of kind of medium I definitely don't try to get by easy at all but at the same time I'm not really like okay okay you know like I'm not that hard of myself but I have not been on this lately especially since I moved over here in my new room I was for a minute and then I ended up getting sick or something oh yeah I ended up having fibroid surgery and so that got me off again but here we go now just a disclaimer I'm telling you guys right now I am NOT at even a medium level but I just want to let you know how I understand reading the music notes so this song is called safe and sound I know you guys probably remember it maybe not by the title but you know that Tata Tata Tata Tata yeah that song so that's what this song is so we're gonna go through the simple version because that's what I'm on the simplest pressing of course version of this song now this may sound a little off as far as tempo for some of you if you know piano like that but that's only because between the tempo of the song that's on the actual phone and my earphones to hear the sound of the keys it's gonna be a little off but you guys are gonna hear the understanding of the song I wish I could pull some more like but I don't feel like getting out my lights I'm just gonna put this in a lore corner of the video but I'm gonna let you guys see you know you guys won't be able to hear the song by the way cuz it's in my head I'm sorry  I'm playing with both hands like literally in the simplest version like I said oh my gosh oh goodness huh there is no way if one of my friends is over here and they're just like let me hear what you did so far yeah I'll be so nervous it's the stupidest thing ever one of these days I may see if I could play the saw that he's actually playing that I'm hearing but oh you guys big uh I would have been so far ahead I wouldn't have stopped by this time cuz man this does get a little complicated but piano is definitely something that I've always had a love for and I just want to learn so bad so when they invented this app I was like Oh fo sho especially at the price that they had and the price that I paid is probably I think it's $90 and this is for the whole year think about that guys on your own pace you can do as much as you want you can go back as much as you want no fussing and arguing hitting on the knuckles with a ruler as many hours as you want for $90 for 12 months can't beat it at all welcome back to my office obviously this guy's it's like the best place for like lighting in my bathroom so that's like um I pretty much keep coming back in here and I can control how bright and how dim it is because I have the vanity bulbs but want to come on here and give you guys a PSA guys I understand right now it's a really chaotic time dealing with this whole quran of virus code it 19 whatever you want to title it however outside of this 24/7 in this country in the whole world there is homelessness everywhere but mainly I want to focus on New York if you know anyone in New York or if you know a family or anything that is dealing with a situation where they need clothes they don't necessarily have to be homeless you know they could have had a house fire or something devastating that happened where they need clothes guys I have a full bag or two bags of clothes I don't want to sell anything there are some items on my part if you want to see some of the items I'll put them in a link below but literally those items are not even scratching the surface on how many clothes I have that I want to get rid of I want to give them to someone who really needs them I don't want to take them to a goodwill or anything I've had them before this whole corona virus hit it's just that now I'm really pushing things out of my space to get more space and that's one of the things that really really needs to go so if you know anyone in New York any families that need clothes please let me know and there's some really nice clothes they don't have any holes or you know damaged or anything like that because those I threw away and there were some clothes I even put in the charity shoot I think I've actually blogged that so just want to let you guys know about that please hit me up on my Instagram if you have my Instagram or Twitter which is all right harmony and yeah that's the end of my PSA and get my robe y'all for this witch in the house so I know it's chilly outside and I won't eat the plushy one but honestly you guys don't a reason I think this videos like a little dull because I got started vlogging so late today like when I started vlogging those probably like four o'clock oh it's like oh my gosh haven't you started vlogging it I don't know but today time really moved by so fast I don't even know what that was today but uh oh by the way today is rent day I got no one for y'all Chili's out Chili's out by the tide is Oh with Nick Cannon he did all my life Oh Raz's turn up she hit up her landlord and told him about everything that's going on with the coronavirus she asks for two weeks without paying rent and he agree I don't have to pay rent until April 1st thank God for that it's I'm not even joking I laughing but I'm not joking oh you guys just don't know how much I'm thankful for it so hopefully miss some happy and some switch up some go back some

sorry it wasn't a lot going on in this but I honestly think this is like the dullest video period since 2020 started cuz when I told you 2020 I was gonna be dropping at the bangers I mean I didn't know the coronavirus was gonna happen but I was serious but I said nothing but veins was dropping that's all that's been dropping I feel like all of my videos I've been dropping I've been so entertaining and I just feel like this coronavirus series is just something people can always look back on and be like what happened this day when after this day like no I'm not a news reporter I'm not the weatherman or anything like I'm not going out there hey look at this look at this look at this well I'm trying not be around people like that you feel what I'm saying but I always feel like these videos to be something look back on like years later whenever they want to find out oh what happened when a corona virus hit or what did some people do when the corona virus was here boom baby I got you covered a whole series for you so let me get started editing this video I will see you guys Morrow which is supposed to be a nice day therefore we are going to get out arises a rise in or rise
