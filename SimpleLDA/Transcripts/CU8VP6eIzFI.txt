  I think that's better hey guys what is that welcome back to my channel in today's video we're going to talk about vlogging how to vlog vlogging 101 whatever you want to call it basically if you want to know how to vlog then I hopefully share some tips within this video that's really going to help you to get started with your vlog channel or even just implementing more vlogs into your current youtube channel first things first I want to clarify what is a vlog so vlog stands for video a blog you put them together and you've got vlog and I feel like that term is thrown around really busi here on youtube but basically what it means is it's the style of filming that you are using so when you guys see my videos on every Tuesday my camera is on a tripod the whole entire time and that isn't considered a vlog main difference for me is that a vlog is more so behind the scenes content it's telling a story you're holding your camera most of the time as well as the video that takes up a certain period of time like it shows a length of time I guess you could say but it really is like a diary in a sense and it's just the style of filming now if you've been subscribed to my channel for a while then you would know that at the beginning of this year I decided to try out a vlogging strategy I'm really trying with the idea of having one video week be my normal youtube strategies tips tricks and then the other video would be like a weekly vlog or a daily vlog where I want to bring you guys a bit more behind the scenes but even before that I've been vlogging for a while I honestly used to think that vlogging was so so easy and few watch other successful youtubers that do vlogs they make it look easy but let me just tell you it is so so much harder than it look so in today's video we're gonna talk about vlogging blogging tips equipment everything you need to know so grab your notebook and let's get started you want to become a vlogger you do not need the best equipment to get started honestly it really comes down to what you are filming the way you are filming and your personality I watched several youtubers that actually only film their vlogs on their phone so if you where's my phone so if you have a smartphone and you do not have any other fancy camera I would really recommend just using this to film your YouTube videos you can get a great quality visual but if you are looking to get a camera I film all my videos here on this canon eos m50 I'm not one of those youtubers that has a different camera for their sit-down videos compared to their vlogs this is what I use for everything but if you are looking to invest in a camera to start vlogging the one thing I would want you guys to look out for is a flip-out screen you can either have a flip out flip up or flip down screen you just want some things that you can see yourself the first camera I ever vlog with is this one right here and as you guys can see it does not have a flip out screen so when I was filming myself I couldn't actually tell if I was in focus if I was in the frame what was actually in the background so the one thing I would recommend you guys is you do not need to invest thousands of dollars in a camera you just need something where you can see yourself next you will need a memory card of some kind and I would highly recommend that you get a pretty large memory card the one that I mainly use is 128 gigabytes and makes it really easy because I'm never worried about storage and I can film all day long to make sure I get all the shots that I want to get for my vlogs and then the last thing I would recommend but it's definitely not a necessity is a small handheld tripod this one right here I think I paid $18 for but it's really great because I put my camera on it I can hold it out and it helps to just hold my camera but also if I'm going from a spot where I'm holding my camera and then I want to sit it down on my table or something I've got it on a tripod already and it just makes it really really easy so this tripod is great I won't include it in the description bar down below again it's not a necessity but I would recommend it if you're gonna vlog once you've got your equipment then you need to figure out what you're actually going to vlog about and one big misconception especially about daily vloggers is that every day they just pick up their camera and they just film whatever is going on when in reality if you go out a day and you're like okay I'm gonna vlog today but you don't know what you're going to include in the vlog 1 it's going to be all over the place and 2 it's just it's not going to be that great of a vlog so you really need to figure out from the beginning before you even pick up your camera what are you going vlog about now this is something that I really really messed up back in February when I was trying to incorporate vlogs with my youtube channel and I even uploaded a video sharing how uploading vlogs actually lost subscribers for me and it really stunted my growth on the platform for a little while you know I had to accept that that my vlog style videos weren't going to do as well to start out but I'm hoping that in the future they're going to be doing even better and I realized because my YouTube channel is really focused on YouTube tips so I was trying to incorporate vlogs that were more so daily life and I did like a travel vlog where I went to Alabama and I did another vlog where my fiance plugged my day and honestly you guys my subscribers could care less about that content and I had to realize that it wasn't because the style of the videos like it wasn't because it was a vlog compared to a sit-down video cuz because of the topic so now my vlogs all relate to the business of YouTube behind the scenes and it's still really focused on my main niche one person that I really look up to in terms of vlogs is Sara's day and if you guys have not checked her out before I really really recommend it but she started her youtube channel based off of health and fitness and all of her videos are vlog style but she knows that her main Miche her main topic is fitness and health so within every single one of her youtube videos even though she's vlogging her daily life she tries to incorporate a workout or a recipe and it sticks to her niche so that the people that are subscribed to her channel are honestly interested in every single vlog that she uploads so before you even get started I really want you to figure out what you're going to vlog about and brainstorm some ideas that relate to that so one thing that I do is I take a look at my calendar and I'm like okay what is coming up that I can vlog again one of the days I had two podcast interviews in a day and I was like okay I can turn this into a vlog because here's the thing vlogging is really behind this seems content guys that's one thing you really need to remember it is behind-the-scenes content it's bringing people along on your daily life and showing them things that they probably wouldn't see unless they were a fly on the wall so you can take a look at your calendar and say okay this day I'm doing this and that could actually turn into a good vlog it's an easy way to come up with content now it's time to start vlogging but like I already said you don't just want to go into the day and say okay I'm going to vlog today you more so when I have a plan so that you're not just spending all of your time sitting watching TV or doing laundry and you don't actually film any of the interesting stuff you want to have a general idea for the vlog or even a title already in mind so one of the blogs that I actually just recently filmed that you guys are gonna see here shortly is me struggling to learn Final Cut Pro oh my god you're really embarrassing myself I mentioned in a few videos that I was looking to invest in Final Cut you guys let me know that they're doing an ID a free trial so you signed up for that and I said okay this vlog the main focus is going to be me trying to learn Final Cut Pro but that wasn't the only thing that I wanted to include in the video because if you are filming a day in the life or if you're filming a week in the life there is so what's so much more that goes into it and to make it an interesting ball you need to include multiple scenes a key thing that you have to remember with vlogging is that it's all about telling a story honestly guys this will change your life when it comes to vlogging you are trying to share with your audience that you're doing certain things throughout the day so let's say you said okay I did my laundry I made myself breakfast now it's time to like shower and get ready for the day but you don't actually show any of that you're missing out on an opportunity to not only set the scene for your vlog but also tell the story of your day so one thing that I like to do I mean obviously right now I can't go to coffee shops and I'm not gonna go to a store for absolutely no reason so just sitting in my car but I wanted to share with you guys that my journey to even getting into my cars starting my car it is part of what I want to show you guys in my videos because it helps to tell the story  now you may be thinking did she really just get in her car and drive to a random parking lot to film that scene and the answer is yes guys because it's all about the story but also b-roll shots are your best friend you will notice that even in these videos where I'm doing more so a sit down talking video I include a lot of numeral scenes and other different clips on top of my general just here's the talking the script of the video I include a lot of different clips because it makes it interesting and one thing that a lot of people get caught up on is thinking that they're just like daily life what they do in a typical day is boring when in reality what's boring to you is interesting to someone else and I seriously want you guys to write that down what is boring to you is interesting to someone else for me if filming a YouTube video or even just taking an Instagram photo it's so natural to me and I don't think that it's interesting for a vlog when in reality one of the questions I get asked all the time is how I take and edit my Instagram photos and that's content that you guys actually want to see and if I just got stuck in thinking oh this is boring everyone knows how I take instagram photos or people take their own Instagram photos like this isn't good content I would actually be holding myself from the content but you guys really want to see and the key thing you need to remember is that vlogging is going to be awkward if you are doing it in front of other people if you are doing it in public even if you're doing it by yourself at home it is awkward and it takes some time to get used to but the other thing is you may notice that when you're vlogging it seems like things are a bit unnatural and I really think one of the secrets to vlogging is making something that is a natural to film look very natural in the editing process so I want to take what seems like a relatively simple scene filling up my water bottle and share with you guys how I would really film this first step in the process find good lighting honestly with a vlog you can get away with not having perfect lighting all the time but I do have a big window light here and I'm just gonna use that for this scene but you want to share step by step what you're doing to get to the final product so for this first thing I'm gonna do unscrew the top then you got to move the camera around again and one thing that I love to do guys is change the perspective so I am going to to set the camera down this is just like the true what vlogging really is like man I actually filled this up too much trying to get that second angle but I just also had this angle so where can I move my camera let's hurry move it over here so in reality filling up my water bottle would have taken me much less time than it did to get all the clips that I wanted to do and it's not natural when you're doing it but when it comes to the final edited piece  it looks freaking good but honestly that little clip would have been nothing without the music so this segment of the video is sponsored by epidemic sound it is the platform that I use to find all of my copyright free music here on YouTube as well as I use it on my IG TVs as well but the really cool thing is all of the music that I included within this YouTube video I actually created an album with epidemic sound so you guys can get access to the same tracks that I love and use it in my youtube videos so if you're really struggling to find the perfect song that fits your vlog definitely check out epidemic sound and more specifically take a look at Katherine's V world beats because I'm sure there's going to be songs in there that you're going to like but thank you so much Stephanie sound for sponsoring this video if you guys want to give it a try you can try it out with a one-month free trial using the link in the description bar down below I just want to share a couple of other tips with you guys when it comes to vlogging I feel like there's so so much that I can share and so much that I can include in this video but let me just give you some basic tips that I think you need to know the very first thing is a mistake that all youtubers and vloggers make a beginning and that is if you have a camera that has a flip-out screen and for me and my screen is over on the side but a lot of people will just look at the screen and they will not look at the lens or even if you're filming on your phone this little tiny dot right here that is the camera and that's where you need to look and it is so easy to look at yourself and want to fix your hair when goes my hair is frizzy because the rain outside it is so so easy to do that but it's gonna end up being a not as great video the only reason you need to look over here is when you are setting the shot and making sure that you are in focus the second thing I need my camera for guys no one likes shaky footage if you have got a shaky hand a shaky arm the easiest thing you can do I'm gonna show you right here I just rest my elbow on something and then I hold my camera and it makes it a little bit study or guys honestly that's why I really really recommend having a tripod it makes it nice when I'm moving from a scene where I am holding it and then I want to just set it down because my arm is shaking already on a tripod it's really easy to set it up and I'm good to go to continue vlogging another really really great tip that I have for you guys is to mix up your point of view so there's two different ways that I like to look at it the first way is as if you guys were actually looking at me if you were in the room with me what would you be seeing if you were looking at me compared to what you would be seeing if you were me so you may notice that in all of my vlogs I have some scenes where I am holding the camera facing towards me just like I am now compared to when I'm facing my camera on something else and I'm showing you exactly what I'm seeing it helps to change the perspective for your viewer as well as really put them in your shoes which is what they want to do if they want to watch your vlogs and I've shared this tips so so many times on my youtube channel but honestly what you really need to do is watch your favorite vloggers and figure out what they're doing within their vlogs that make them interesting and keep you coming back for more it's gonna be one of the best ways for you to realize this is the shot that I can include in my vlog or maybe I really love a lot of b-roll scenes and also talking and here's a cool transition it's really just going to help you to better understand how you can improve your vlog so definitely watch other youtubers it's going to help you a lot but if you guys like these tips make sure you give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel it really does help to support me I'll see you guys back here on Tuesday with another video and on Friday with a vlog hey guys what am i I cannot talk today girl get it together okay hahaha I need to get my life together I can talk woo Catherine I'm like rambling and not on focus here I need to get on focus
