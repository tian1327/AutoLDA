 hey everybody so today's video is going to be a little bit different instead of talking directly into the camera to you about something that has happened in the last 24 hours on Twitter I am actually going to do something that I have done before like a long time ago in the past before I started doing all of this commentary stuff and that's a good old-school og YouTube vlog and today I wanted to take you with me to Whole Foods to go grocery shopping in Brooklyn New York because whereas that might not seem like a really awesome thing to share with you all out there we are living in pandemic times and so going to the grocery store is a completely different experience now and those of you who have been in New York know how commuting in New York usually is some of the footages that you're going to see is a little different so why don't we change the scenery real quick let's go well I didn't even get a phone or keys or anything I was just ready to go my phone keys my desk is dirty where's my wallet technically I don't need the wallet but there is ok so the first thing that you'll probably notice aside from my facebook Messenger going off is that I am wearing a mask because here you are not allowed to go into any store as of today actually the governor said he is going to sign an executive order stating that businesses can deny people entry if they're not wearing a mask and actually thank you a lot of different businesses as have already done that thing so here we are outside so we're gonna get on the train next I live close to the Train I don't even know oh I need to get a MetroCard one of mr. trade credit consolidation and please okay so now we're on the train I don't know if you guys can hear me but we're on the train it is currently 6:30 and that's really important because 6:30 p.m. in New York is a time when everyone's getting off it's not even a weekend right now but regardless of whether it's a weekend or not you know it's rush hour and as you can see there's nobody on the train there are 3 people total now we're looking at Atlantic Barclays which is a really big station in Brooklyn where a whole bunch of different lines cross together and this place is usually swarming with people as you can see especially this part right here it's just empty comparatively it's empty I think I saw four people just then this place usually has people going up and down the stairs and waiting on the Long Island Rail Road train boards where those two people are walking this is the Apple store in downtown and there are always people gathered around nothing so we arrived at Whole Foods now that's the one you wanted last time and they didn't have it oh my god hey is that all you're getting no kidding alright let's find the eggs and while he went to go find eggs I found sauces as for me I still only have chicken and beef do you need anything else I don't think so I'm not sure though oh it's also worth noting that people are ordering their groceries for delivery a lot now it's gonna be right here wait did I pass it nope no wait what where is it there's usually nothing but rice cauliflower found the eggs there's a lot more people here than I expected well what so now you have pork and eggs we're gonna make a pork and eggs you got flour oh and milk and spices after we got all of our groceries it was time to pay and even in this situation a lot of grocery stores I don't know about where you are but ours in New York have built up these partitions everybody wears gloves now because they're the essential workers they're the ones you know grocery store workers are essential and they're making things happen along with everybody else like firefighters and nurses and doctors so I really have to put my heart out to them even the old girl through the receipt on the counter like that I tried to like treat my bag as a totem now my elbow is stuck I can't help me pull this off okay I'm gonna let go yeah I'm just not gonna do it like that thank you since the pandemic started I've been trying to get two weeks worth of groceries whenever I go out but sometimes that makes my bag really heavy and again it's just wild like these corridors that I'm showing you right now are usually packed full of people especially there at the Atlantic Barclays side of our entrance of the train station because there's usually a show going on there are literally tens of thousands if not all 10,000 I guess people waiting outside for a concert or a Nets game or coming in from Manhattan for an event this is a place where like the overwatch finals happened this is a place where the Brooklyn Nets play this is the place where concerts by famous folks happen and now we're just living in a world of masks and washing your hands except I always do that anyway oh there's a cat to be a cat without a care in the world can cats get the pen the virus I don't know well you know we can't worry too much we can just be careful and you've got to eat so you should definitely go out and get groceries too it's an important thing to do just stay safe well I'm out
