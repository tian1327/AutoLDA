  so someone I know tested positive for the chrono virus I never thought I'd be making this video I was informed by somebody to bring disinfectant wipes to bring I'm gonna bring the only little Lysol hand sanitizer that I have and tissue because the swab goes deep up your nose and you kind of want to comfort yourself and then the Tres trash bag to be safe I don't have a face mask they were gone by the time I tried to buy any I don't have gloves they're gone so I am gonna just consistently hand sanitizer my hands I'm gonna use those disinfectant wipes to get in my car I'm getting tested I'm not nervous I just relieved I have had asthma my whole life I had it mostly as a child I grew out of it but every once in a while just as I've been an adult I will be affected by it so I'm gonna take you with me to go get tested for the crown of my wrist it's a drive-through know swab the person that I know that he's already done it it's painful but it's short and it's quick they're not like up there excavating your nose hole out it's not gonna be a long process it's in and out I have had symptoms that kind of freaked me out when I started having diarrhea I keep checking my fever and I've had a 99.1 degree fever I don't know how that translates in Europe but that's a mild fever but it's never spiked really high I never thought this would happen to me me I knew it was in the States but it happened so quickly everybody be careful and let's go on a road trip to go get my nose swapped I look so hot right now anyways let's hit the road jack and get get goin to get that test and who knows the conspiracy theories of how it started at the end of the day I know someone the tested positive and I know other people that had to test because of that and I'm now getting tested so it's hit my front porch quicker than a fly on  I just I'm realizing that this is the last time I'm gonna be out and about for two weeks solid I've been home a lot although I ran a couple errands but I've like made myself a homebody more than I already am because I really am the whole buddy but this is the last time I'm over - secret like it'll be done with spring by the time I like parking out my door who knows what kind of person I'll be on the other side of this we'll see we're here at the testing site I would be lying if I said I didn't get a nervous rush I do I'm a little early so we'll have you pull down and follow the orange cones until you get to a stop sign down there and I'll tell you when to pull up under the tent somebody's gonna come right to you stick a swab up your nose do you have an experienced it before it's not gonna be your favorite thing but your worst thing I move will call you which results we're telling people several days it's hopefully gonna take four or five but it might take longer there were more people are being tested it's taking longer to come back stay home and stay away from other people eventually since your self symptomatic and I'm not gonna lie you kinda have that look that everybody has through you just looks thick yeah fortunately most people don't feel probably much worse than you do now that's about as bad as it gets however you mean yeah okay yeah the whole thing you just feel kind of achy and rundown sometimes headache dragged off yeah it's kind of about it yeah I've had diarrhea which has scared me yeah I know that gas or intestinal yeah there have been some people with those kinds of symptoms again for the most part though like eighty percent of people are skating through with pretty mild organs thank you so much yeah there's a number on there for you to call us if you have any questions or things get worse you're gonna start getting a text message from us every day checking on your symptoms okay and then call us anytime we're really trying to keep people out of the emergency rooms as much as we can yeah so as much as we can treat you at home that's what our goal is and and for you too that would be a good okay so plenty of ways to be in contact with us no be in contact with us every day thank you so much together okay thank you you keep telling people they didn't teach me how to do this a nursing school oh you're so sweet thank you I'm scared I'm skilled and scaled oh gosh  I have to wait for the nurse to wave me oh it says no videos so I will see you guys on the other side oh my gosh oh my gosh so I just left I'm laughing because I feel like that was deep I feel like that was like like I feel like I got blasted into another dimension and I started laughing afterwards they have you cover your mouth with a paper towel if you start coughing or if you jerks they say don't jerk they give you something to cover your nose if you win a call for anything like that and then they stick the swab up your nose it literally feels like it drills all the way up to like your soul like your third dimension and I literally I was like whoa and they're like if you're not crying then we didn't go far enough so they went far enough cuz my left eye was like watering immediately and I started laughing I literally said to them I was like I feel like you know my whole life story and they started laughing and she the nurse said thank you for making me laugh today that she really needed it I'm definitely glad I brought my tissue my hand sanitizer and everything because I just want to like I just want to like cuddle my left nose hole I'm I'm hunkering down for the long haul I am not understanding how to get the freak out of this area like I just pray for everybody that has a speedy recovery and healing and that they have peace throughout it all regardless of the outcome that they have peace beyond all understanding I just don't like that people are scared I think once I knew I potentially had at the fear went away the potential to get it all right Wow this video is dragging on I really hope you enjoyed it and you enjoy the adventure of going with somebody who could get there no swab for the novel virus that's plugging the world right now so wow that is all I have for you I really hope you enjoyed this video if you like what you see or if you want to share this with anybody please do give it one big thumbs up to let me know you liked it it really helps me out remember to subscribe to my channel hit that great belt to be notified the moment I upload another video every Wednesday and on the weekends on all things ADHD mental well-being and personal development and I hope you know by now that y'all are in my prayers and I will see you next time
