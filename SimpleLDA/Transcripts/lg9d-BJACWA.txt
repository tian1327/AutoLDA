  well I'm trying can you hold it what's the phone I'm going over the clerk  oh wow they come in twos  I can't thank the whale can you elaborate so she can get some too  we need to get out of the way because there's a giant thing coming out it's like people have turned into less than babies nobody's just taking turns I don't get it why do I hear people like mr. Raymond over there well at least I know people aren't going for desserts you know a lot of eggs it's 36 times 2 it's 36 in total I'm going on you sorry I'm not get it well no not come on my ass   all right that's a lot better I just had breakfast i sat down for an hour i chilled out i relaxed it's I'm literally not doing anything besides homework so you know there's not much that I can do but it is I'm like looking on my phone it is 12 27 and I'm pretty sure that my mom is gonna want to go and visit her parents and see if they're okay she does have to take a final with my uncle so we're gonna try and do something like super quick to like work out but literally I'm just trying to find like the most basic ways to like not to study the basic ways to like work out as of right now it's just like it's either like YouTube videos of like workouts and I'll link things down below of what I think is nice to work out with or it's just like basic stuff that people just forget home on my lips are so pale hold on but literally like I can't stand that but you know um I hope you enjoyed that Walmart video footage or whatever I did make a video this week like this past week and it came out so slow because I was doing it on my phone but like the amount of footage on my phone right now is just too much for it to handle so everything came out in slow-mo and I lost all the footage basically because I can't I don't know how to transfer it over and yeah so I went on my SD card the one that I'm recording on right now and I just deleted a bunch of videos I move things around to my computer and you know I mean like it has been a journey but we're here and I'm recording so that's great because this is this is how I keep sane okay this is how I keep saying but um yeah my room is a pigsty so that's my uh that used to be my jacket that I would go running with or running in when it was like super cold and I would go to the track and yeah just run a little bit that's my yoga mat where we'll be using that a little bit I love these boards on the wall like I know what tired I like woke up at 9:00 but yeah so I love having little boards on the wall I did I love having boards on the wall because it keeps you it just it's easier to keep track of things cuz I can physically see it at all times I have like a little thing over there oh my god don't ask me why don't ask me why because I can't even remove it because of my mom so get over it but yeah I like took out some clothes out of my closet that I really don't use I will probably take out even more and I'm just gonna hang them up here take pictures of it and start putting my clothes on depop cuz why not what what what else I'm going to bed uh what else am I going to be doing what am i up to nothing okay so yeah we're gonna do that my bed whatever I should have got instead of a camera lunchbox excuse me I sure got a like a backpack with pockets so I could take it to school and not have to worry about it not not have like this pack pack at this backpack and a lunchbox like anything United mean but I didn't think that one through so here we are but yeah I'm just gonna tie my hair back up and I'm going to try and do a hundred situps and 100 squats and then I'm probably gonna take a shower I'm sorry for the people out there but one I got to make sure that my grandparents are okay um and yeah I want to go see my boyfriend too because my boyfriend actually lives with them right now you like rent out a room and stuff like that so we're gonna go do that and yeah I hope everyone is safe I hope you guys are working out keeping yourselves happy and yeah try and stay saying out there guys because I know how hard it is you know I mean like I'm pretty sure that I have cried myself to sleep or cried in my bed like just laying in bed like twice this week for other reasons that have to do with the quarantine but yeah like just try your best to stay sane keep yourself busy because yeah just try and keep yourself busy but um I guess let's work out I don't know but yeah all right let's go I just finished my hundred sacks I put my stuff away you're actually on one of my drawers right now which is a little sad but you gotta do what you gotta do but since I am pretty bad I'm pretty bad at doing squats so okay so what I'm gonna do is basically push my bed until there is like a spot for me to like sit on and I'm just gonna do a hundred squats 100 squats sitting down on that the boxer part I think of my bed and that'll be it literally that's it so I forgot that I even had these but I remembered that I actually bought resistance bands for the summer because I did want to work out at the park a lot more or like the beach because I know like some beaches here in Long Island like they have little parks there so this is like a really big band but I'm pretty sure that I have little bands as well probably in my closet somewhere but yeah I like if you want you can use a big band and you can step on it and then yeah I'm gonna try it why not okay so I am done with my mini workout my hair is up I look like a mess yeah so I'm gonna go shower and and okay so I'm back um I did a lot since you last saw me just saying like a second ago but I organized my entire room I have laundry that I have to fold I packed my bag because I do have to take them some things to my boyfriend and she's gonna give me things too it's later in the day but it's still bright so I'm just gonna close that I'll open it later when I'm off camera yeah I took out a lot of clothes a lot of those clothes I'm actually gonna try and put it on deep hop I know I keep doing this with like the little hairs that I have right here but I when I was younger I started waxing my sideburns off because I just didn't really like them at all and then yeah my boyfriend now he's like why are you doing that I think it's too high like they started waxing like way too high so they are I started taking like pieces of my actual hair so these are technically my sideburns right here but I'm hoping that they couldn't grow and just become more hair or fur my head not the side of my face but so I actually without this like so hot right now I say it's so hot but it's literally like Alexa what's the temperature right now right now it's 66 degrees Fahrenheit tonight expect a low of 45 degrees I'm literally sweating and it's only 66 yeah I like organized here so this is like the things that I have to like not have to but I enjoy reading or like my art stuff which is completely fine why is it so blue but anyways so right now I am just gonna try and do one homework assignment before I leave and fold my laundry that's all that I have planned to do like right now so come see me study slash do homework I guess I don't know      okay so I am back it is kind of late outside already I know I'm not supposed to go out but me and my mom have things that we need to do we need to make sure that our family is okay boyfriend knows okay they all reside in the same place and yeah so I had to deliver a package to my boyfriend anyways so I tagged along and I'm not gonna lie I wanted to see my boyfriend too but he did give me a lot of things which I am so happy about but uh I guess backpack whole I don't know okay so obviously I gave my boyfriend a package but anyways let's see what we got I'm pretty sure no I am a hundred percent sure
