 everyone good to see you I really wanted to work with larger paper I actually know I have larger paper but this is what I have for now and it's Fabriano cold press it's 140 pounds I may revisit this but I'm very excited to have some corn to draw I didn't add some extra color to it but I will just incorporate that into my painting just because I can and let's see if I have even a pencil with lead in it here today I'm very low on that I'm a pencil here and I should have a sharpener yeah I have to neaten up my space a little bit getting a little out of hand so here's my sketch I love the kernels of corn I'm ready to have some popcorn and watch one of my shows on Netflix after this I'm not gonna do that but I'm just dreaming of movies and popcorn and cinema and going to the theater so here we go so here's this sketch I'm in New York we're in lockdown in the city and I'm okay with that and I'm gonna keep painting and keep doing my vegetable improves my healthy paintings eat healthy stay home stay safe now you go out you wear your mask this piece say that's all I'm trying to preach want you to be around for a very long time so we can not agree about wearing the mask and if you agree very good but anyway just be safe guys that's all I care about I'm grateful that you're here watching we all want good and the same things and we need to be patient and we'll be okay I went through my flat files found a lot of different paper really want to explore I want to start some oils which I may have said before and every once in a while I hear from a friend I haven't heard from in a while and it's always fun to reconnect you know and I'm finally doing my taxes it's still me I'm doing them and remember those little the little holders sometimes you could get that would hold the different ends of the corn on the cob when you'd eat it I'm grateful to have experienced the little holders for the corn on the cob lupita read in there for some contrast that's why have any paper towels here yep yep here we go you ever see different color corn especially in the fall I just wonder how that happened it must just be a different crop and so he's so cool so I think of corn for summertime and then I also think of it for the fall harvest it's still cool in the city in New York so I imagine in the Upstate areas it must be a little cool too I don't even know if you could see the corn in this it's just a field of strings of green but it was fun to paint and I need to go in and define some of those shapes you can listen to some old reruns of ballgames you get that summertime feeling I'd love to listen to baseball on TV just to kind of listen to it in the background I mean I watch the World Series and things but you know but I just love that sound such summer there we go got it done all right or maybe revisiting the corn but this is a quick painting of corn on the cob my fruit and vegetables stay safe stay healthy have fun thanks for watching take care
