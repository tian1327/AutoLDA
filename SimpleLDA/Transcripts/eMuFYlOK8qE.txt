      that's the that's the parking lot to to jewel-osco a lot of people coming in and out in and out in and out I had to get out like oh my god it's with this quarantine and everything you're just cramped up inside and it's just like really irritated so it's I I just had to get out   there's a random cat just showed up  that's a new cat I haven't seen and usually we see a couple straight - around my house but that's a new one he's not too happy about the camera in this race though that I had enough of that about enough of that camera in my face that's kind of how I feel right now I can tell you guys right now it's quarantine is not for me it is annoying it's annoying but being stuck at home does have a couple advantages it leaves me able to kind of work on my flipping because my flipping needs some work and there's no better place to do it and in your front yard so see how good I can get with this    kind of going back to what I was saying earlier about how this sucks for fishermen really really bad because it's the spawn also it got a lot colder out of nowhere that's why I got a hoodie on I'm gonna show you a tree girl real quick here it's a budding basically that a not necessarily too warm but the other day it was really one day before that it was or the longer just getting over some 70 degree days not too long ago so luck alright got really windy and really really really cold that's weird I know I know it doesn't do a whole lot for your confidence if it being spring going from straight tank top to straight sweatshirt promise you that it's spring its spring it's it's time we'll go fish so it's gonna be a lot harder to go fishing but I don't think I'm gonna stop actually no think about it cuz right now it's probably time you gets the biggest fish of your life so those are least some videos coming up so I mean even though it's not the warmest day out right now it is sunny the beach sitting inside all day doing nothing basically this is basically what my days consist of if I'm not fishing during the corner and take up eat watch TV sleep eat sleep you know same old same old I do encourage you guys to get out though if you can get out just take a walk or something I don't even like walks and I'm taking a walk even though it's cold I promise and I look like I'm cold I'm really enjoying my time outside so the thing I wanted to talk to you guys about real quick is planning a pretty big trip that was coming up here in May but since circumstances happened clearly that trips not gonna happen quite yet it's gonna be postponed I'm still getting something in the mix but it's just gonna take a little bit of time I don't necessarily want to tell you where I was going but I just because I might still be going there and then if I told you that it would kind of ruin a surprise but it's a big big big trip yes stop bummer the whole thing is a bummer like I'm not even gonna lie i what a much rather if you're gonna happen not much rather it happened in like you know late fall so then we could actually stay inside when we don't want to be outside which is winter when it got cold I looked at the forecast on my phone and I saw that it was gonna be somewhat chilly like it is now for a couple days and then it gets back up into the mid 50s you know low 60s so I'm gonna wait to fish until that point but guys let me know in the comments how the quarantine life is treating you guys kind of curious to find out what other people are doing right now I know some of you were still fishing some you're probably sitting inside I'm kind of doing a mixture of both if I'm being honest I'm gonna wrap up wrap up the vlog is I'm gonna edit Oh sue all right kid I'm gonna edit this video and we'll see where I get with it but I'm late I'm lazy being inside all day is making me super freakin lazy
