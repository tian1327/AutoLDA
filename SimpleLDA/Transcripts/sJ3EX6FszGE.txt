photo    excuse me yeah you know how you just like you know how when you move somewhere and you think that you really do a lot of stuff away before you moved but then when you move you realize that you still got a lot of stuff that you need to throw away that's why I meant right now I thought for sure that I went through all my clothes I juiced old stuff away I thought that I went through all my junk and crap everywhere do stuff away but apparently since then thought another way sis me helps if need deliveries dang I'm still going through boxes and stuff I still got a lot of stuff to go

okay calm down at all but this is the first room okay let's just talk about this room so it's literally nothing so when you come in this room it's literally the BA right here right so this is where mama Bri will be sleeping there this is her room when she come visit the bed is still a little messy so only thing I have on this wall it's just a picture right here it says New York GI helped me come up with some whoa this room is not that big but I need some advice on the way how to do this I'm pretty close the blinds in here because seriously seriously Pete so I'm gonna show you guys from this angle it's not really much this room is not that B it's just this little area right here so I feel like I could probably put something right here on this wall I don't really know maybe put something up being right here or even put something on this wall just to give it a more homey feel because it ain't nothing besides a TV in this little little stand right here so this is one room so this is the second row right here so this one was a little I don't know if it's a little bit more spacious or not but this room chocolate girl why are the blinds open all my rooms I don't know oh yeah this is the view of this room so I gotta find something to put it on these walls like the walls are bare this wall is bare this is the beach right here the closet is a nice size but that's a little bad from JCPenney over there so comment below some ideas to play at least my rooms do have bees so I could have plenty of guests over but I really just need to decorate like I just feel like it'll be I'll feel so much better once it's decorated and I need to put something in my hallway all I think I got in my hallway is a freaking plug-in right here I freaking plug me like I feel like I might gonna put like a nice picture over here something over there something homey make you feel all good and goosh Leon inside so I don't really know like even in my room like you know how some people have like a decorative vision for their home I really don't have a decorative vision but honestly I never had a house before I've always had like an apartment so apartments is very easy to just go together and you only want to put too much work into our apartment because it's temporary I don't own this house or nothing but I plan on being here for a couple years so I want to feel and you know as homey as possible especially with this transition to Georgia or North Carolina so you want to feel homey so yeah I don't need some ideas like my room is pretty pretty simple like we obviously got the black dresser we got that black bean way up here so it's like I got these pictures behind me got black in them I got you know I just want to like try to have like a vision for my rouhani and in these curtains all these curtains is brown saw my AP what kind of vision do you have for your room he ain't even got no vision so I really don't even know I don't know I think once we could start going back to the stores because literally once we moved here y'all the virus came so it was like we didn't really have time to go to any stores to go pick out like nice the rolls for my couch nice little pillows like I want to get a little pillows I want to get my little stuff you know I'm seeing so it's like I didn't get a chance to shop to do anything like I have like a little budget for the house that I'm just looking at in my account like I can't wait to spin you and buy a little stuck with you so I'm definitely definitely wanna do I have no vision I went like I whatever stuff I had what stuff already had in storage literally I did not buy nothing new for this house when I moved here this is everything that I had in storage besides those beads so you know I don't really know I'm sure I figured out like I really like graves I like blues I like tools I like Silver's I like a little bit of hello fuchsia um stuff like that so I don't know like I said I don't know what colors I'm going for in my house but even downstairs is like I see burgundy down there I see gray but I really don't like Burgundy so I gotta I'm gonna do my kitchen all the way over I'm gonna find me some nice rugs for my kitchen I'm gonna find me a nice light tablecloth for my table a nice picture for my kitchen like I want to get help my stuff looking like how prissy do it look contemporary a little modern so I don't know Copple Oh some of your ideas if you have if you like decorative stuff I'm not really that much into decoration but I do like I do like certain things you know I'm saying you know ever I like Alyssa in a certain way so oh let me ask another question do people still have living room tables or is that another thing anymore like is that not a thing because I don't never see people with a livery one say be like that I'm worried like yeah back in the day days they had liberland sailing the minitor floor do you had the ant tables by the couch oh really say that no I'm worried so I don't know that's something I will buy or purchase I'm not really sure might purchase an end table though the living room is so awkwardly shaped because the bathroom is literally in the middle of the floor so it's a little irritating so it's like it's hard to position my couches so I don't really know but this blog was just about I need help trying to figure out how to decorate my house so kind of blossom advice I like I said again hug did you guys had a great day I'll get you guys didn't give too much into the drama and news and I know that some of you guys are struggling like I know you're struggling I like literally this is probably the most nerve-wracking situation that anybody anybody can face but the thing is that we are all in this together so the feelings that you have everyone can have those feelings but some people choose to put their energy into other things and think about other things and got to be honest it's a lot more other things that's more serious like this sense that happened all the time in life but it's like this one thing really scared the whole world when it is a lot of sicknesses out here that people causing themself back our daily you know I'm saying so I don't know I just hope that you're not allowing these situations who you know turn your faith from God I hope that you guys are not allowing this situation to you know make you afraid and fearful to live period because these are if you are a believer these are things that were spoken in the Bible so if you live by the word you know the word you know what was gonna happen in foreseeing the word so you have to just trust what his plan is trust what he's doing and you have to just continue to live and I'm guilty of it too we all have a moment of your life who this is crazy but you always have to snap back and be like okay this is not your forever in other parts of the world where it was bad it got better so that is that that little that little right there that little thing I just said just dean other parts of the world it got better China got better Italy got better these people were lockdown for 70 76 days when I saw that China was a lot now for 76 days wow that's a lot of days but now they're there seen the other side they're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel finally after 76 days so sometimes you might be in a situation for a long time but it's always temporary and we have to remember that so this situations well be temporary God already showed us the faith in the light when he showed us that he cleared it up in China and when he showed it up when he showed us that he cleared it up in Italy if he could show us that then we have some light then you should be able to feel comfortable and trust him here in America that we gonna have some light so I know that's just a reminder for me too like it's gonna get better girl and my whole thing I just really want to see my mom okay I want to see my brother I missed him so much but this is also teaching me a lot - like I said I'm leaning on my husband this time my god but like I had to set up for me all right Shawn he know what he'd be doing and I'm trusting and I'm just I'm leaning on my husband's strength in my husband show me so much strength and it means so much to me that he showed me this through this I'm telling you he's been doing with a lot with me but he always been doing on me since we first met cuz he know I've been crazy but seriously though you know I think that we ought to take a breather you know stalking is so caught up in the numbers in the drama just protect your family protect yourself protect your peace and everything's gonna be okay I already see the light already I already know it's gonna be okay yes that's all I can really say so hope you guys enjoyed this short little vlog weren't really much but I want to just take you guys along with me for today and um I love you guys Gang Gang Gang
