in there do everything by themselves I'm not really wearing I know our ghost is a good dog I will feel more comfortable if I was in there with him I don't know how they're gonna handle him because he's hyper you know I'm saying the last time I went they did pretty good but that's like in the presence of an owner you know I'm saying the presence of another person you feel me he's supposed to get his rabies shot and then they're just gonna do a physical exam make sure he's all good and I probably put him on heart guard yeah I'm saying for heartworms and stuff like that they're gonna do a test on that I just know it's gonna break my pockets man I just know that that is expensive man anybody out there is a new dog owner or thinking about getting a dog just to make sure you got some money or enough money for vet bills and things like that because it's not cheap yeah I'm saying a couple hundred dollars but some of you guys may be like you know still young maybe not working or maybe are

could pull it off but let me know down in the comments which you guys I think is more with the warmer weather I don't know like because I think last time I came it was like allergy related he gave me look out Jim medicine but I noticed you know during the like colder season is not really like as prevalent but like during it like I noticed it maybe a few weeks ago three weeks ago four weeks ago something like that but it's been like on and off like some days like he would do it more than the other days some days he wouldn't do it at all I saw online that there is like a difference between like the foamy white and foamy yellow is not funny at all it's more so like literally like snot I would wonder if there is some component of an allergy to it and so all right sounds good thank you Oh good job man you good huh good the treatment the Argos weighs 51 pounds all right now he was like 58 pounds but he was kind of like chunky you know I started cutting back on his food so he can slim down a little bit so he can be healthier on his joints and he's 51 pounds as of today so that's pretty good now that you know he's at a good size I can start adding more food to his diet to get him a little bit bigger but they said he's healthy it was good man he treats when we get back to the house man apparently he did pretty good they said he was trying to love him everybody which sounds like Argos jump point I was a super hyper nobody that was fast off those gonna take a lot longer than that all right good job buddy it's my boy I got this right here it's called a mr. Trillo so it has flea tick and heartworm and one yeah I'm saying I can get this to him once a month I'm gonna try it out first see how he reacts to it and you know if he does pretty good then I'm going to go ahead and get a six month six-month dosage of it so it'd be you know six tablets but anyway I'm not to go to the post office to drop this off and I'm gonna pick up that package one of my subscribers sent me and I'll see you uh soon y'all stay tuned alright guys I just got to the post office Virginia or the governor just passed a law saying starting today you gotta wear a mask any time you're out in public so that's why I got this mask on all right so I got this package I thought I was tripping when I said no so I already notice the toy in here what he said man big shout-out to uh actually when I open it up on myself draw it again man but I remember what I was gonna say man anybody that's the essential worker that has to wear this damn mask all day bro yo y'all alert y'all are amazing man cuz when I wear this  I damn near pass out it's hard to breathe you know I'm saying a big shout-out to y'all man all the essential workers out there hey y'all drop some hearts down in the comments for all the essential workers out there man let them know that we care about them let them know that we love them y'all deserve hazard pay y'all deserve all the benefits man because y'all risking y'all life you know coming in contact with hundreds of customers a day if not thousands depending on where you work drop some hearts down below man but I'm about to go home and I'm gonna open up this package show you guys what I got and I'm gonna record a video for our BOCES channel a lot of you up and watching my videos man I haven't been subscribing I looked at the analytics man said any % of y'all they'll be watching my videos man make sure you hit that subscribe button I'm gonna keep telling y'all to y'all subscribe bro but uh y'all stay tuned no stopping squeal right now I got these it is a nurse for the record box and box you chasing squirrels all my backyard like this we're already glowing is right here Oh Hey look no more Oh two for two can you get through for three let's do that again that's my fault that's a bad pass Laros Hey with the three alright guys well Argos is playing with that I'm gonna go ahead and close the video so I can give him his icecream once again if you're not subscribed already go subscribe to this channel alright don't be don't be a creep man don't be a weirdo watching my channel without subscribing man it's free it takes like what two seconds you know I'm saying click the bells and get a notification anytime my posts comment down below show some love man in the comments and make sure you subscribe to my other two channels we got Showtime reacts it's a reaction channel you guys will not be disappointed trust me it's a good time over there and we also got we also got life with Argos so if you guys want to see more clips of Argos some raw feedings things like that man go subscribe to his channel and um I'm gonna be posting that ice cream video today as well so you guys will get to see this and then right after you finish this you can go watch the me give him ice cream but until next time I'm out of here man what are you talking about Friday nice that the running shoes are all the boys i played with left the game system running shooter run shoot my life just like pirates all I wants to lose I just want my parents living comes everything you want they say it's up to you
