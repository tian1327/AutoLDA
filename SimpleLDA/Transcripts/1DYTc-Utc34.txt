 it will help come back to my channel that's a jeffree star intro if I've ever heard one anyways hello welcome back and I say welcome back with such a heavy heart because it has been a while and I've missed you guys so much I digress um hello welcome to covet 19 it is I don't I have so many updates for you guys I don't even know where to start I have no idea where um first off leave me in the comments how you've been doing what you've been doing to get over this and the whole so I can not say that word NES word social isolation because if any of you live alone like moi um you would know that it's a little I mean it's not that weird because I do live alone and like I'm used to being alone on daily basis but just the mere fact that like now that I have to be alone all the time I want to not be alone so that makes sense and by alone I does I want to be with my friends not necessarily like a boyfriend or anything don't have one if you wanted to have that which is a okay with me outfit of the day I'm wearing not a cute fanny pack but this was before fanny packs are cool I still have it I'm just really old black adidas they are completely worn down on the bottom no big deal I no longer wear them for running they're just for my hiking which I'm about to go hiking I have my cirrus day pants and they are super cute they have like the little Dalmatian print on them and then I have a target top and then if you can see in the back my serious day matching swirl and Better Bodies hat this stays on my head so well I don't necessarily love it but it's like perfect for not like working out with it and like I went running the other day with it and no slippage at all none at all um so yeah anyways that's my OOTD and maybe I'll get some footage going to the park    look what my friend got me unless it was my birthday on Friday I turned 30 you guys I am 30 years old down updates I I don't I I don't I don't know where to start I do not know where to start I am struggling I'm struggling or real hard what kind of job I want to know what kind of jobs you guys have because it has been such a bizarre experience transitioning from being in a school and counseling to being online now fully and counseling and I I'm struggling not having my hall passes because like I like having control the situation where I know all my kids are in the building and I can get any of them like any second it's like I've been struggling checking my emails and on stop doing check-ins like I don't know how my kids are all doing and that's been really hurting me so if any of you guys your teachers you just work in education at all you understand like where I'm coming from with how like awful this husband but at the same time you just have to get creative and find different outlets for them I've been doing YouTube videos more than every week and they seem to really like that I think just having that face-to-face contact has been really nice and probably reason why I wanted to come back here because I like I said I'm struggling a little bit with the fact that I don't have I like people at my immediate like help to say hello or anyone even face-to-face like I am feeling a little bit alike I'm getting cabin fever you know what I mean I feel like you guys do we're all in this right now together at the same time so I really wanted to make sure you guys are okay I'm doing well if indeed you're wondering I'm doing very well only just missing interaction because as much as I thought like I knew I was a social person like I got in trouble all growing up like I would get to tensions just because I love talking to people during class I was like a social butterfly is how my teachers described me and that was just my thing I love communicating with people and FaceTime is great telephone calls are great there's just that person-to-person interaction that I crave anyways little update also i am i put my resignation and for the end of the school year and this was before any of this was happening only slightly slightly nervous just because i don't know what's gonna happen with like job security a lot of people got laid off like a lot of people are struggling i've been really really thankful that with at least in our school i'm in Ohio you know we're all getting paid through the summer like there's not gonna be there's they're gonna stop pay we're also really lucky that we have a one-to-one technology so that means all of our kids went home with a Dell laptop which is amazing and so all of them can still continue online learning unless there are a few percentages that just don't have internet and don't have that capability of getting in or not spectrum a lot of different internet providers are giving out free internet to the kiddos I don't have that at home for financial reasons or whatever the case may be but there are still some kids that they actually just cannot gather and for them again it's where you have to get creative in it so yeah my plan preach Ovid 19 and right now is to move I want to get out of the Dayton area which is where I'm at right now in Ohio I want to I'm thinking here's my strategy right now I could become interested near you I'm thinking Columbus st. Louis Nashville San Francisco is like one of those like mmm I don't think I can afford I'm living man I think we love San Francisco so I I put it on like oh maybe I don't know list and maybe Austin I have not been das and I've just heard really cool things and I'm just ready for a life change like I thought I'm single I am 30 now I need just a change right now I've been in like the date an area for around God if I'm 30 12 years I mean give and take a few because a couple years I was looking at my parents but 10 years let's say 10 years I'm ready to migrate elsewhere and I think that I just I need this I need this really bad I need to change I'm probably gonna still be a school counselor and if for some reason I cannot get a job as a school counselor wherever I end up moving I will look into like college something within like higher education or even what are you doing kitty or even doing something out of the box I don't know I have no idea my sister works at Abercrombie & Fitch headquarters and she was giving me a couple job options there that aren't in my degree realm I have a master's in school counseling but uh sound like something that I would actually enjoy doing and probably pay a little bit better to so we'll see I'll let you guys know lies that job hunt continued I've only applied to two schools so far so I still have a lot of work to do and other than that updates Oliver's doing super well right here he's huge right your actual big yes I'm Chester is he's probably behind my mirror here oh yes he sees hello hello you can come out I was just vacuuming so he got a little antsy because he does not like the vacuum come I'm gonna show you guys my new office tour because I had to move my office home so let's go do that get a little bit similar to my office and that way it feels like my workspace I wanted to keep like my studying as like structured as possible and I think so it felt like I was still a counseling and because I still have all the same duties I had then just a little more difficult because I don't have as much resources at my disposal okay you guys I gotta go to the park maybe I'll show you guys some beautiful footage and then if I don't see you again I have a trunk club over here I signed up because they were having a promo where you got 25% off your entire trunk and and they don't do that so I signed up to get a truck I'll do a video if you guys want to see outfit of the day okay a hall and then try on I will do that just leave in the comments below if you're interested and I love you guys and I will be back I hope you guys are doing well see you soon bye
