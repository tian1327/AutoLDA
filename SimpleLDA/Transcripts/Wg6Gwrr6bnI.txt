 well it's day two right now over here in Chicago and as you can see from the background it's not-- go figure and because my job pretty much requires me to work at home because we fall under the category of essentials I must do my assistants too as well in helping with the society on certain times like this so lucky me shake it off so we're pretty much stuck and cooped up in here the next two weeks working because my job classifies under essentials at the meantime check out my you know YouTube account you guys want to please subscribe           it's what pretty much is bored right now and this is now day three Saturday so well just better to do it than just make some nice quick little video this of the car and yes so my job again pretty much requires me to still work at home because you know I do have people out there that we still have to take care of businesses business but I'm really just coming down to some withdrawal of you know some some speed well I can't when we say speed because it's this is a Miata it's no this morning which was really really really rare during this time but rare um let me retract that not rare we're in the essence that it's March in a snowing but if you live in Chicago you know that you're expected to get some snow even during the April time but moving forward things I'm really going to do with this car there's a lot of things I want to do this car this has been sitting out in the garage for quite some time I'm gonna get some parts rolling that for it and started moving from with some progress and doing the projects that I really wanted to fulfill with the goals that I have set and I really can't commit to it as of yet because well this weather is not motivating especially if it's cold around here and if you're gonna be stuck pretty much you know with certain pieces of parts lingering around I hate doing that get all the parts and take care of it all in one day and not to add into daily personal goals which is the responsible goals which is finances and everything etc that's something that's pretty much as the moving mindset direction to take pretty much looking forward to making any type of goals before committing to a project for the car that's so good you
