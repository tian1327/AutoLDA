 hey what's up so it is Friday and we are still in lockdown huh we're gonna talk about money today today we're gonna talk about money that's what we're gonna talk about let's get into it okay so first of all first things first I just want to say that yes I did do my own hair it's not the greatest since we took my money because I like to you know get waxes and I like to go get my nails done which are not done I like to do those things right to get my eyebrows done and that's not happening but you know it is what it is so let's get into how am i making money right how am i making my coin I'm basically working independently like I've been doing for the past year except it wasn't really working as well last year but this year you know I guess maybe my mindset must have changed or maybe maybe no I don't know I don't know maybe just it wasn't my time that's here but now I guess it is my time so I started working with an online teaching website or like a class website called out school and I will put my referral link at the bottom for anyone that teaches and wants to teach my experience with out school is so far it's it's been cool but I haven't really told anyone yet Monday I start teaching so I will talk about how it is teaching or Monday basically that's about it I just I literally put my classes that I'm teaching available on out school which is afro dance connecting the afro diaspora and also I will be trying to teach Brazilian samba I'm still in the process of putting that together drafting that etc because it's a bit different from afro dance with teaching kids because I'm used to teaching children is afro dance so the ages on our school that's available is K through 12 you can teach basically high school middle school elementary school and says I already have experience teaching elementary school and middle school and high school it kind of works out for me except this is going to be virtual this is not my first online this is not my first time teaching online and some of you may know I do teach throughout the week afro dance nineties persistence style so I'm gonna pay so with that being said it's a little bit different our school is with kids out of school it's strictly grade school and on top of that it's consistent so it's basically parents subscribe or they pay for the week or the month or however long the class you chose you chose to put there they pay for that so it's basically like literally it's like you're doing online school that's what it's like so it's a little bit difficult eaching with like Dance Studios dance studios is you basically promote yourself and it's open to all and most of times open to adults so there's that difference so I am optimistic about Monday if any of you have experienced teacher wear out school please let me know or if you have experience teaching online in a virtual school period drop your comments below as well that works as well another way that I do also make money is again teaching dance classes um through like dance studios I know I already mentioned that but like that's another way that I'm making money at third I have my patreon it's now available and I will be offering behind the scenes videos blogs etc and I also will be announcing on my patreon where exactly in the United States I will be relocating to if you watch my last video you'll see that I mentioned that I am relocating but this time I'm gonna put it in my patreon and I'm going to let my patrons that support my work and support on what I'm doing exactly where I'm relocating so what patreon is is basically it's a way for you to make money or to gain money for your projects for whatever you have going on for me specifically I am a content creator and I would like to buy more gadgets help me produce films and produce kids and produce dance films etc and just to help me put out great content so that's why I have my patreon I know some other people have it for other reasons but that's my visa it's just basically to support and create better quality content with you because that's what I'm passionate about you know saying I'm passionate about the entertainment industry like that's what I like to do and that's another reason why I'm moving um most people my vision why are you gonna move I'm gonna move out of New York because like one I need to go somewhere where film and cinema is a little bit more serious I feel in New York is serious but I just need to go somewhere new like I need to see new things I need to see other states and I need to see with entertainment industry it's like other places it will all make sense once you subscribe to my patreon once you become a patreon and support you'll see all the things that it's going on everything that I said in this video is going to make sense so those are three ways that I'm making money teaching online and also teaching at dance studios online and also through my patreon so that's how I'm making money how are you making money drop comments below say how you're making money I am going to try to try other virtual online schools but like because our school is so packed I think that I will just focus on out school out school basically it has my schedule packed I have summer classes that summer I have I have everything set up like I've been working really hard to get all the curriculum and syllabuses together to make sure that all my students from grade K to 12 are basically satisfied and everything is fulfilled it does take a little bit of time setting up but it is worth it and also because in New York City I'm not sure about other states but because in New York City we are unlocked down until May 28th if we were supposed to be out of lockdown today but we're not we suppose where we're looking at the 28th or June 13th and on top of that summer programs are closed and some of you may know I am an educator and I am a part of the education system however because this lockdown is still you know happening most summer programs and school academic school has been canceled throughout the year so I don't know when they're gonna start back school again if it's September or if it's next year I'm not sure but it's looking like it's gonna be virtual all the way until September I think we'll be updated by like maybe September will be updated but in my humble opinion I'm expecting this thing to come right back around during the fall so I think that school might stay virtual as it is right now especially in New York City especially we were hit so hard with the epic center of this coronavirus so yeah guys that's about it so I will be sticking with out school and I will be trying to do other virtual classes but once I get the hang of out school and once I feel like ah I could do whatever I can to other of the outlets I could do all that I could to did it or not then I will move on to other schools right now I really want to master our school and I want to contain it because I actually have been getting a lot of signups with out of school so yeah it's it's moving it's been moving so so far so good I will keep you guys updated on my first class on blood day and that's gonna be amazing it's gonna be fun I'm looking forward to it go quick I just want to say I just want to say shutouts to people who subscribe to my tips on shout outs to y'all like my take on cast into an
