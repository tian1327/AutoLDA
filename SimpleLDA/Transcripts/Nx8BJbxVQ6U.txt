 hey guys it's manna welcome back to my youtube channel today I'm going to be taking you guys into a day of my life and Quarantine you guys really seem to like the other one that I posted I just realized I didn't have like a proper intro for this video so here it is I'm also really excited to tell you guys I partnered with Google for this video so we have a fun little try on haul later on in this little vlog so I hope you guys enjoy it and yeah I'll welcome to the phones all night basically reorganizing my closet because I just had so many clothes and things I needed to declutter I'm gonna make my bed cuz she's messy right now    so my post mate just called me told me he's almost here dropping off my breakfast so I'm excited okay we have to go wash our hands now so this is breakfast and also this really amine carrot ginger tumeric juice it has a bunch of good for you things and I also got some ginger shots I told them to put one of the three ginger shots into the juice so I'm already just drinking it while I'm drinking the juice and I'm watching kotico I love him these days I've been on YouTube a lot and cody KO just seems to make me laugh when I'm not feeling my best even though I woke up in a good mood today so I'm just gonna eat this and so just at breakfast I'm feeling really good for the past couple of days that I haven't been feeling my best and I'm being honest my anxiety has just been kind of kicking in and my body where well it just hasn't been feeling good so I have decided I'm like trying not to eat junk food but I feel good my face breakfast with Drew and all that stuff I'm just getting ready now nowadays like I just got ready to make tic TOCs and take photos if I do end up taking any but I don't know this whole situation kind of just has had me thinking I feel really like weird and this time I'm like a very quick and go person I like to be busy I like to be doing things and you know I live a very fast-paced life which I'm so grateful for and it's something I've always loved about you know my life and especially my career now I'm so blessed that I get opportunities where I get to just travel the world and you know document it and show it to you guys I just feel really weird not working there's a battery I have this is good to a certain extent but I take a lot of pride in my job I love what I do but I depend on a lot of my happiness and satisfaction based on my success and what I'm doing and now since I've just like you know not been doing anything I just feel weird and I don't feel happy cuz I just feel like I'm not really doing anything productive I'm not gonna go to my friends houses cuz I'm not gonna do that to the other people that I have actually been following the rules of you know social distancing and it sucks because in Miami like no one's respecting this whole thing when people are still going over people's houses people are still going to see their boyfriends and their girlfriends and listen I'm not an emotionless monster that's like what the heck like I get it I get if you want to go see your boyfriend like I understand but I just wish people would be more considerate and be like you know what I'm just gonna follow the rules because if everyone just stayed home I'm gonna be dealing with the situation and I just feel like this is just gonna get more and more out of pocket and I highly doubt that we're gonna be able to leave our houses do like July so there goes my summer the only contact I have with y'all tech world is my neighbor and that is the only person I've seen during this whole thing and the only place that we go is upstairs and downstairs which is basically guys if we were living in the same house like we both order our groceries online we disinfect everything like kind of like as if I'm quarantine II with that but I also just stayed in my own apartment cuz i film hearing stuff so I don't feel like I'm fully losing my mind you guys are all so so lucky if you're like quarantine II with family because at least you have someone to annoy you you might complain about it but at least your quarantine II with someone um if you're with your family and they're driving you crazy at least you're not like fully alone I've also been watching a lot of Netflix to pass the time reading books I have like been rereading every book series that I've ever read since I was like in middle school so that's fun honestly books have always been an escape for me so I don't mind just being cooped up at home and reading books because I would have done that anyway but this whole thing really has me thinking like I shouldn't have left early that one night that we went out I love social interaction I love going to like lunch or brunch I mean you guys know this if you follow me on Instagram I'm always doing something  so I'm going to change it's been in this city for like two days already you know and be like that so I'm gonna find an outfit in my clothing I'm gonna show you guys I am so proud of my closet right now cuz it's so organized y'all I really snapped honestly everything's organized and hung up I'm just honestly so proud of myself like all my shoes

have everything linked down below and yeah yeah I'm gonna put that all in my closet now and organize it and I'll be back when I'm doing something but we're gonna make lunch I got my hello fresh this is not sponsored I just literally just cooking is so much easier you know we're gonna be doing the amazing apricot chicken so we're gonna try this one out I haven't made this before so this is what it looks like we're gonna make this for lunch just a tip I usually do this with a ziplock bag I get like really hot boiling hot water like I'll microwave water and then I'll put the chicken cutlet that's frozen into the ziplock bag and it'll literally defrost it so much faster but since I don't have any I'm just using it in like a bowl with super hot water so these are the ingredients we got some jasmine rice we got some green beans we have Asha locks or shallot whatever-the-hell some time we have a chicken concentrate we have some balsamic vinegar and we have apricot jam also please ignore my nails I took off my acrylics we're gonna do them later on today we're just gonna cook first I put the jasmine rice in the rice cooker it was 3/4 of a cup of rice so I put a cup and a half of water I put some olive oil and some salt and we're just gonna let this cook and now we're gonna peel and cut this a lot so I honestly really missed cooking healthy food I feel like when I don't order like my hellofresh it just makes it look more annoying to cook and I'm not gonna lie I have worked with them in the past and I would work with them again but honestly I paid for this myself and they have great customer service and it's great because I actually got on the phone with them today because this week I accidentally didn't skip it so the shelah is peeled so we're gonna clean as we go with this because I don't want to mess after I make lunch can someone please tell me how to pronounce this correctly I don't want to mess this up but it's basically like an onion we're gonna cut it so we have our chicken here so we're gonna season it with salt and pepper I just had it dry with paper towel it literally just such a season with salt and pepper which literally triggers me but whatever we'll see him because we are making I guess like a sauce so we're just supposed to put this directly on the pan I already have the pan here with some olive oil and we're gonna cook this 3 to 5 minutes per side so now we're gonna make this sauce so I put some extra olive oil in the pan I know I made a mess ok and we're gonna add the shallots so now we're just adding the time this thing is like attacking me it's like exploding so then I put in a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and I also put in the apricot jam and we're just gonna let this simmer a little bit and as it cooks the sauce just gets a little thicker for the chicken and then we'll just put in the chicken so I decided not to use the green beans I wanted some asparagus so I'm just making that I just seasoned it with salt and pepper and I'm like frying it a little bit and here is the plate so far got some white jasmine rice chicken what sometimes oh this is finished product of lunch here's my date so since we obviously are quarantine well Ally and I still see each other but you know she's doing her own thing right now so I'm gonna eat this we have our little date going on you know face time if anyone wants to have a coffee date or a face time date hit us up girl face time it'd be like that I just honestly haven't had a healthy meal in a minute I'm gonna eat this because I'm super hungry so okay so I'm currently unloading my dishwasher and everything away and I'm gonna put in everything that's in here that I've been looking at and I just don't feel like doing the dishes today okay if you guys hear like weird noises it's literally the dishwasher I'm so sorry also I put a hoodie on so I never show you guys like the business side of things when it comes to my job I obviously am very blessed and I'm so grateful that I have this job so I kind of wanted to just sit down obviously and talk to you guys and also explain to you guys what I'm doing so um I usually go through my emails early in the morning but yesterday I had a really bad day I'm gonna be so honest with you guys yesterday was a tough day for me you know as someone that's dealt with anxiety for the past couple of years there's just days where you know it hits you and there's not much you can do so yesterday I kinda was just staring at the ceiling all day and I was like I don't want this for myself and you know I understand that the situation is going on and it's hard but we have to make the best of it sitting around and of doing anything isn't serving a purpose if I am home and you know I just like woke up this morning and I was like you know what I'm gonna make the best of it try and be as productive as possible sometimes my anxiety comes and it's intense sometimes it doesn't come at all and it doesn't bother me but yesterday was one of those days you know where it was intense and that's why this morning I woke up and I was like you know what I'm gonna film I'm gonna be productive I'm going to be on my game so I have a lot of things to do right now so I turned in a video that I was editing that's the only thing I really did yesterday I have a campaign with Smashbox right now so I filmed a video with my sister Anila last week um she came down with my mom and stuff because that was porn keening with them up there but I had to come down in the film because I really couldn't film and be productive over there a big part of my job obviously is to respond to emails and you know just be on it I am very blessed I get to work from home just like everything going on I know there's some people that you know don't have that opportunity so you know if you have a roof over your head and food in your stomach food in your fridge be really grateful you know I know this is hard for everyone to stay home and it makes me upset personally because it's like my friends from like home here have been just like linking up you don't think it's a big deal and you don't think it's gonna happen to you until it does I have a friend who had a birthday party recently and invited a bunch of people over and one of their friends actually was in close contact with someone who tested positive and now everyone is scared and freaking out and for the next two weeks they have to quarantine themselves in a room because they all decided to link up for one day thinking of it's harmless but now they all might have it which is really scary because it's also my friends and it's like I don't want to be the bearer of bad news and just like attack people but it's like man if you would have just stayed home like this wouldn't be happening and this is how this spreads like wildfire and it sucks like yesterday I was crying like the entire night because I felt lonely and I miss my family I miss my friends I miss you know doing everything I just need a hug I can't I have to be home until this all blows over and then more people go out longer we're all gonna be basically grounded it's annoying I'm annoyed I'm fed up honestly but yeah this is part of my day so yeah sorry for my ramp but it had to be said and I have a platform so I am going to try and positively influence you guys but yeah I'm gonna get to this and I'll touch base later hey guys so I've just been on my computer for the past like two hours and I'm just taking my makeup off I'm using the Bobbi Brown soothing cleansing oil they're pretty much just like uses all over my face and then I'll go ahead and take my cleanser and I usually use the over vitamin C cleanser this is a brand new bottle because I literally just use the last of like my other one and I'll usually use cleansing oil because I have this fear they're gonna clog my pores but I had no other option today this is like new I haven't really been using this oil for a long so I'm still testing it all successfully remove the majority of my makeup though even though I look crazy I'm just seeing a baby wipe now I'm taking off like the excess so my skin is clean I can come into a mess I don't know what kind mill I'd if I want to like detox my pores so we're gonna be using the origins clear improvement charcoal honey mask this base is really like not only hydrates but it just clears out your pores this mask also smells are really weird like not about it like a good word my goodness todrick smell to me I don't know it smells like Cuban like a widow if that makes sense and I'm breaking out on my forehead so I wanted to clear up like I don't know what else to do honestly I've never done with this before and it's got annoying yeah okay yeah the mask is on I'm gonna go watch elite and just let this do its thing actually put some lip balm on - this one's from fresh there lip balms are my favorite and they're like amazing so I'm gonna put this dusk essential oil this is a Victor V oil it's like my favorite I discovered it when I went to Hawaii and I say that the four seasons it says literally go buy a hotel room smelled like and this is a spa room oil diffuser so it works really well so I'm just gonna put a couple dots of essential oil in there is oil diffuser is fire and it just makes my house smell good and we're just gonna light some candles as well alrighty guys so we're gonna make some chicken noodle soup but these are the ingredients you're gonna need a huge shout-outs and oz and Inc Avari for this recipe I add my own twist to it but I do base it off hers I will anchors down below if you guys want like a different I guess point of view you're gonna need some garlic oil this adds a really nice flavoring to the soup and I don't use a lot of it cuz it is not good for you some thyme some butter some onions a chicken rosemary you're gonna need a some chicken broth some carrots some celery parsley lemon two potatoes garlic bay leaves and egg noodles I'm not sure if this is a noodles but this is what my instacart person delivered I hope this is egg noodles but it's just like a little cost I guess and some salt and pepper so we cut up our produce I peeled and cut the potatoes I also mince some garlic and I'm gonna put a spoon of butter in the pan where we're gonna be making our soup I'm also putting in some olive oil so I put in the carrots the celery and the onion and the garlic and we're just gonna stir this thing and let's just kind of marinade it for the next couple of minutes I'm also putting in a little bit of this Lori's urban garlic just a touch for flavor no I added some pink Himalayan salt and now I'm gonna add some thyme this is the body I won you can get this literally like I think anywhere so I add it in the pink Himalayan salt the thyme and some black pepper now I'm gonna add some chicken but I'm also cooking chicken on the side and it is time to oh you guys I added the whole thing of chicken broth and now I'm adding in a cup of water so now when you add it the goggle the foil flavor so now we're gonna add the rosemary we are gonna take this out at the end two bay leaves and then we're also gonna take the potatoes and put them into the boil and the chicken is ready I'm gonna let it cool down and then I'm gonna rip it up and put it into the soup we're also gonna take two cups of the egg noodles and pour that in now we're gonna give everything a good mix now I'm just gonna let everything cook up in the next couple of minutes and I'll be back when it's ready I wish you guys could smell this
