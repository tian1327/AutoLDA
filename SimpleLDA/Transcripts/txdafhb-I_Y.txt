 so I will say like about a month and a half ago the city started shutting down and only allowing essential workers to work and commute to work everyone else had to just stay home and honestly we and I say we mean my wife we were very fortunate because I'm an essential worker not the worker itself but I'm in an essential field so I'm still working basically I go out almost every day for work not including the weekends but um you know I'm still out and about she however has not gone to the office and oh and I think it's been six almost seven weeks already luckily for her she wasn't laid off or anything because she has a you know she works from home on her computer or whatever and she's good to go she can you know they figured out a way to forward calls to her cell phone so she's she's a full-blown little person working at home and and thank God for that because there's a lot of people that don't have jobs right now a lot a lot of restaurants laid off if not everyone the majority of their staff and it's just you know basically the city that's that's what it lives on restaurants bars obviously tourism is is non-existent right now I mean we've been riding through the city and just dishes basically nobody out except unless you live down there you know but um you know obviously no traffic as you can see this this road would usually be pretty packed and I mean we're not even in the city we're in Long Island you know where things are a little bit more spread out but uh even this little strip right here would we would probably be behind a few cars or a few cars behind us there's only one car behind us now so traffic has been dramatically reduced well yeah I mean we've been we've been very lucky that we haven't Bentley at all for anything like that we're still working we're still getting paid and yeah everything on that front is good school wise obviously the kids are not in school I have one daughter that's in first grade the other one is just being you know taking care by my mom which actually happened to be safe for a little while thank god she's been a lot better nowadays Ethan never she never went to the hospital or anything it was just I believe it was the flu she didn't really have any respiratory issues but uh thank god she's feeling better anyways um long story short the wife and the kids have been home for the past six weeks and you know since I've been working you know going leaving the house and coming back in the firt they're like the very first few weeks was very tense in the house and I mean it was you know I'll fight after a fight because she didn't want me leaving the house and she would say hey you're putting me at risk and this and that the other it was a very tense moment because I'm basically put between the heart placing a rock set up backwards or here so slowing down rock in a hard place because you know at the end of the day I do have to still go out for work but I also want to keep my family safe so in my industry where I work out employees are dealing with people it's a retail environment you know so they are you know the very first few weeks there was no mandate to wear masks or any of that stuff companies were still figuring out what to do and how to protect their employees as they still had to work so there was no Plexiglas anything protecting us we there was a shortage of masks so really everyone was just quitting like even though they had a job they just didn't want to be put in that predicament you know there were a lot of them were quitting for multiple reasons like hey my family doesn't really want me to work or or I'm afraid you know and and that really was the biggest issue with us you know um keeping the staff and you know most of all keeping everyone that we work with safe and and protecting ourselves on top of that and you know but it was very very difficult very difficult eventually then the company started doing certain things to try to protect us we we got a hold of mass we got a we got gloves we got sanitizer for personal use then they started allowing us to to work from home a few days and then they put a plexiglass on in the stores to protect the employees in the store so it was it started getting a little better but um there was still this type of uncertainty with those employees like man like you know I'm coming out here every day risking basically my life right now you know and and that's how a lot of people that I've spoken to that uh are essential they say the same thing like man we're we're basically dying out here a lot of NTA I've known a lot of MTA folks and man like they just started reducing hours for the MTA you know and these guys were we're basically you know even though ridership was down people were not working not commuting to work they still had a follow the same schedule which makes sense because at the end of the day you still have to run for essential workers and that kind of stuff but it was just a big mess guys it was a really big mess nobody knew what to do how to react I would say now that we're we're almost two months into this thing things are starting to feel a little bit more not I want to say normal because there's definitely no way we're we're normal but things are feeling a little safer you will see people wearing masks in the streets you know basically nowadays if you know if you're in public you kind of have to wear a mask even if you're not six feet apart or even if you aren't six feet apart people are just wearing masks you know it's a the level of fear is still very high but I feel like you know it's already gone too long and people are starting to get really tired of of being home and you got to remember guys this is New York City like I live in the Bronx and luckily I have I live in the multifamily so I have access to a yard but you got to remember the city itself there are so many buildings so many and a lot of them believe it or not are low income or mixed income where a percentage of the apartments are there paying regular rent the rest is just section eight or any other program but basically there's a lot of people living in buildings and how do you stay with confined in your four six eight walls it's like you're in jail man like it really is bad so I don't know how these guys are doing it you know I'm sure you know by now they've gone out and done whatever they have to do you know they gotta get grow people got a shop you know every grocery store has a line around the freakin block nowadays I went out yesterday to get propane just so I can do some grilling in the back just to get that tank it I honestly took me over an hour over an hour I was almost 40 minutes 40 minutes waiting online just to just to get to someone to say hey let me get a tank and that's the reality that we're facing and in the more densely populated areas people are started to travel a lot further away from home - just get the things that they need they're traveling upstate to Westchester from the Bronx or Queens to go to the Walmart or to go to BJ's and a lot more people are doing that and then now those areas are starting to see a line outside one before there wasn't you know so basically life you know as we know it it's basically done guys I mean I don't even know how we're gonna get back to normal after all this you know and really for a lot of people even the normal that for it seems for us was not normal for them maybe they were struggling or people were struggling before this happened you know this whole thing started so you could just imagine how this has affected everyone you know but I don't know it's just very crazy bought it like I said I'm very grateful that I still have a job you know and getting paid and I'm able to come out with my bro's everybody's healthy but you know it's not to say that I don't know people that have died I do you know almost everyone here knows someone that has died of the virus and that's the eerie reality like we all want to joke and say oh this is some people have I've heard people say oh this is fake you know whatever the truth of the matter is that people are dying from this I know three people actually that have died from it and everyone that I talked to knows at least one person you know so it's a it's a very it's one of those things where you know you know it's happening but at the end of the day it's a shitty situation and there's nothing really you can do and the worst part about it the very very worst part about it is that people that do die from the virus the families can't see them at least from what I've heard and from the people that have died that I know this is what I've been told you know families can't go in to see them in this one particular case the doctor FaceTime them so they can see the deceased like what that's just crazy you know and it's very sad actually you know like I feel really bad for people that have lost loved ones during this time because what if if they can't see them then they have they can't even really burry them because as you guys know with it with everybody dying let's go let's go let's go what a lot of people dying what's happening is funeral homes are overwhelmed too they can't keep up so then they can't keep up with funerals so they started cremated people and then they couldn't even keep up with that so it's a very very sad time and it's uh I really don't wish anyone to die at this point because it's like damn man it just really sucks it's really unfortunate you know and and if you if you are able to actually have a funeral for someone then you know you're limited to a very few amount of people inside the home because obviously distancing rules and maximum capacity rules and all this other stuff you know it's just very very unfortunate so that's basically what we're living here you know I'm sure some of you guys saw videos of people being loaded up dead people being loaded up into trucks that is true that's happening I haven't seen it happen recently I guess the infrastructure is getting better but the first few weeks yeah man they were low being loaded up into trucks right on the block that I live at they were you know few elderly people died and the whole family had to wait outside for hours onto somebody from the funeral home from funeral home came to pick them up hours I'm telling you cops were there and everything just preventing them from going from going inside until these guys came in so I don't know man it's just very very it's still very a very I don't even know what that I'm trying to say it's the shitty time to be living that's for sure especially in the city man you know like I said a lot of us essential workers it might feel like we're still normal-ish because we still go out we still you know we're still out and about basically but for everyone else has been cooped up that cooped up into their in their homes for weeks they're going nuts sorry I can tell you firsthand my wife is just fed up already and we have access to the yard so we still we go back there every so often but she hasn't driven in weeks man but um anyways guys I don't want to ramble I don't want to kind of you know this was basically a little moto vlog talking about a life during this pandemic I'm gonna see if I ride go into the city and kind of record a little bit so you guys can see what the city looks like during this time that'll be that'll be interesting but uh yeah hey guys thanks for tuning in be safe out there please and uh I'll catch you guys on the next one peace out
