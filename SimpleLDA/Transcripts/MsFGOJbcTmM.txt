 what's up guys that welcome back to my channel and today it's just gonna be another quarantine vlog and we're starting off our morning by going to Phil's and getting coffee so what back when California established the stay at home I got a text from Phil's well from the app they didn't personally text me but I got a text saying that they were closing down honestly I was very sad because I love Phil's coffee and I know there's a lot of hype around Phil's coffee and the hype is real honestly I've just I haven't had a coffee since we came into quarantine so enough about Janet sucks come on so enough about me being obsessed with Phil's but we are going to go over to Phil's because that we found out recently that they have they are working and you just have to order your coffee on the app and then you wait until it says a time and then you go and pick up your coffee on this table that they have outside and Isaac just went ahead and got some beans so he can make it at home I don't think it's gonna taste the same did he just leave okay well I think he just left so Hartman's clean cleaned it up and we're about to head over oh my gosh she's already outside this guy here's gonna leave mommy hold on let me put my laptop inside so no one steals it heading to Phil's to go and pick up my favorite coffee ever scoop so it's one big out what you got supporting my leggings my favorite leggings are that I wear probably every day but I wash them because jean jacket $10 from where forever 21 that boy's clothes right now that boy I think it's going to be shutting down soon firmly you talked about that flat stomach or the shirt or the G oh okay alright big Frank no thank you okay you guys tell me what she just did ally put a hand sanitizer on our hands then put hand sanitizer on the cup boy I just completely replace my own put it in a new cup it is so good oh my gosh hi Allison for those of you well let's get the good like over here so just got back from Phil's I got a large filtered soul with light oat milk sweet sugar and iced I always get oat milk their oatmeal is so good they taste so sweet and caffeinated and just so good so Isaac and I don't really have any plans for the day usually we have like a generalize like oh look let's get this done today we might film some tic TOCs I don't know if that's gonna work out I think it's like not a dancer at all I love dancing so it might just be me making tic TOCs but I'm just gonna hang out on our patio on our picnic table hang out go on a computer and um just kind of hang out  and it went like    such a nice day out that I can't help but hang out outside all day I'm so happy we got this picnic table because they just sit in our balcony even though we're on the first floor so I guess you could call it a patio and I just love to soak in the Sun honestly getting in a picnic table before all the shops and the shutdown was such an amazing idea because I set out here every single day at work on my computer I drink my coffee I just really loved hanging out outside and honestly I think if I wasn't able to go outside and like be in the Sun I think it would it would definitely advise my mental health the vitamin D makes me happy the sunshine makes me happy and I get to a little soak in a nice tan while this stuff is happening so out here sitting in my porch and I actually just got some packages and one of the packages is my drone charger I forgot my drone charger in Hawaii unfortunately and I only used it like three or four times so yeah so I have been without a drone charger but I'm really happy to finally have it just I was like you know what I live in a courtyard and I could totally take off my drone from inside my patio and just like send it off and just explore while I'm at my apartment so also I got another package princess Polly they sent me some stuff I'm gonna be doing a huge haul and just like some say just like work from home vibes and I got a bunch of stuff from them I'm really excited to try all the stuff on that video is gonna be going up later next week but I'm very anxious so I really want to open the clothes now I might just do the first impressions so I'll just not open that for a while some experience visit self-control exhibiting some self-control right there nothing nothing somebody lives above us so it's not going to be easy to necessarily take off all right I'm gonna charge up my drone and then I'm gonna insert some footage
