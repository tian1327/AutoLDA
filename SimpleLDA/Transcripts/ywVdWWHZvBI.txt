 I love food everywhere we've been looking there is no toilet paper at all just want to be safe and not catch anything and not spread anything to other people there's no   my world  you hey guys happy Thursday I'm coming to you a little bit late today I did not have a late start but I just did my normal morning routine and if you guys have been following me and watching my self quarantine vlogs I'm always showing you guys my morning routine and all the things that I get done and so that hasn't really changed which is why for today decided that I wasn't going to vlog that because I don't want it to be too repetitive so I got all of that stuff done I fed my fur babies I made breakfast for my husband and I we had two grand mulled eggs and toast and some with some butter and blueberries and then I shipped out a sub order tidied up a kitchen like usual again just like my normal morning routine and then I hopped in the shower after deep cleaning the bathrooms and now I'm finally sitting down because I've decided that instead of tidying up my kitchen drawers like I had planned out so if you guys don't know and you're just joining us today um I have been bullet journaling and keeping a schedule of what I want to accomplish in the day so I've been just like putting it together this little structure of what I'm going to get done in the mornings and the afternoons so for today instead of having like stressing myself out and doing too much I decided that I wanted to pick like one task per day so yesterday it was what was it yesterday yesterday it was working on blackboard and making my thumbnail and then the day before I wanted to declutter the my closet which I did so each day I want to have like one task so that I don't overwhelm myself or feel like a failure because I didn't get to it or I decided that I just didn't want to UM so for today I just wrote that I wanted to organize the kitchen drawers and to curl my hair and then do my introvert mind map so in my bullet journal I'll show you guys a little bit closer to I've been like sometimes alright like quotes that I really really like and so I've been like writing down quotes that have to do with introversion that have that like really speak to me so I'll share that with you guys and just a little bit I'm not curling my hair today I'm not going to do a sit-down video because I have a massive headache today I've actually had a really bad headache every single day this week because of allergy season so you guys know everybody mentioned it multiple times this is just like not a fun physically fun time of the year for me so with sit-down videos it takes a lot more energy and effort and had to think about what I'm gonna say and so I don't want to drain myself by doing that when I'm already not feeling well so I'm gonna put that off and like same thing with kitchen drawers that requires me to expend energy so I'm not going to do that instead what I have planned is I'm gonna be working on soap stuffs so if you guys look here I have a huge tub of my midnight Jasmine that is ready to be sold so I have currently I have a hundred and thirty four of these soap bars then I need to upload the listing on Etsy um to reflect that I do have these in stock now and they are so beautiful you guys I love the marbling and the swirling but look help just it's just so pretty this is like my favorite so far aesthetically speaking but each so far what I love about it is that each so far is unique has its own unique design so I'm going to be labeling these and when I open when I first opened my shop I should have labeled pre-labeled all the soap bars and that way when I do get orders it's easier for me I can just like grab a soap bar put it in the recyclable brown paper bags that I use to pack this up the soap bars and then just put the shipping label and be done with it but I didn't do that so like every time I got an a soap order I would have to like carve out time and my evening especially during the work days where my schedule is jam-packed and I would have to like sit down cut the and cut out the labels you know tie the labels onto the soap bars and then put them in the bags and then ship them off so I figured since I have time know that I'm home each day I'm going to label as many soap bars as I can and then that way once all the soap bars are labeled and they're just sitting in the containers here every time I go to so order all I have to do is just pull it out and then put its packaging and then ship it off so today I'm gonna be working on midnight Jasmine it is one of my favorite for you I keep saying that all my supers are my favorite scents because they they actually are I shouldn't say favorite because I love all of them so much if you're into like floral scents then this is the perfect soap bar for you it's smell literally like Jasmine it is so light it's so fragrant and I'm really like obviously you guys know that I have headache issues so I don't like anything that's too heavily scented or fermented because it'll give me a headache so even though my so pores are really fragrant it's not to the point where it'll give you a headache which I really love and they're all natural ingredients so if you haven't visited my shop and you're interested then I've linked it below in my description box it's so pink Oh bye Janice so that's what I'm gonna be doing for this afternoon and I'm probably gonna combine today and tomorrow those logs together since I'm not going to be showing you every single thing but I do like my first two um blogs so that it doesn't become repetitive that was a lot of talking I'm sorry I'm just rambling because my head really really hurts mom dad if you're watching don't worry but eating over very healthy I was just craving this so I'm eating instant noodles but I wanted to show you this is a different kind in case you don't know about this she'll onion is a really popular brand for spite Korean spicy ramen noodles but they came out with a black line which has like kind of a creamy taste to it this sauce Oh what why do you always come why you always come here every time mommy wants to vlog then you come up here and you interrupt it's like I'd be on YouTube too mommy um but yeah it comes with like a little creamy mix so this tastes really good and I just wanted to share with you guys so I'm gonna eat this while I'm waiting for my labels to print and I'm gonna catch up on some vlogs so why'd you guys my man wasn't so bad for you I eat it every day   finally all done today so I'm gonna put this back on my silk blouse I just brushed my teeth and literally like no I rolled out of bed and brushed my teeth now I'm doing and I think I'm gonna make some french toast with I don't think I have any money so I'm gonna try to make french toast I've never made french toast before I remember my guy you see making for me all the time when I was little and I loved it so I'm thinking I'll probably just use milk eggs half and half maybe you just add a little sweetness to it and I wanted to add flour do you like make it crispy and doughy but I don't have flour so I will not use flour this morning I guess this is what I'm going to use cuz this is all I have um I'm work much rather use French brioche bread because our tastes are much better but we don't have that so I'm gonna use we brush instead   would it be weird to fight through it and air fire I don't know have you guys tried that before I'm gonna try and see how it turns out  okay that looks amazing  dah oh my gosh it smells so bad let's try this charlie  I love food don't let you know one of my favorite sounds in the world it's this you guys it's just so calming and they're leading inevitably we ran out of groceries we're running really really really low on toilet paper we still have frozen food that I bought from giant a couple days ago but we're just trying to save that I'm just to be like prepared and yeah just to be prepared we don't know what's gonna happen in this in this world today with all the unknowns and everything that's happening so my husband he's just literally been glued to his computer screen I cannot believe the number of meetings that he's in all day for his job so he said to wait for him to go like when his workday is over but I feel like a lot of people will be grocery shopping at that time so I think it's just um safer to go at an awkward time of the day if that makes sense um however I still do see cars out so um but you know what I'm here and I don't think there's a lot of people and I have my mask just to be safe yeah we're like totally out of groceries you don't have any fresh meat nothing no fresh food just all frozen foods I'm gonna go into H Mart go and grab what we need for the next week and then hopefully they'll have toilet paper here because everywhere we've been looking there is no toilet paper at all yeah I'm gonna put my mask on I you got this from Korea it's kind of cute says I am NOT dangerous I did see a young lady walking out of H Mart she has a mask on too just to be safe hopefully no one thinks I have the riot just want to be safe and not catch anything and not spread anything to other people yeah I got a lot of groceries like good enough for my husband and I to last for her I want to say the rest of this week going into next week but again there's no toilet paper done this is not the brand that I like I've been looking for the brand just legatee but like I can't find it anywhere so I don't really know what's going on but I got this and then I just got some data it is like a barley tea a Korean barley tea it's really good you can have it cold or hot it's and then put it in the pantry just some extra cleaning sponges and this cute little egg-shaped maker so I was gonna use this for eggs and then some creme pancakes I was able to get ingredients for a Korean pancake I was trying to make the other day because I didn't have squid so I ended up making it look like green beans but I got some frozen fish cutlet we have this is with us which is pork cutlet these are all for the freezer which would be nice for like a cup and people which is frozen small octopus and this is what I wanted to use the green onions for the clam pancake which was different oh yeah hello hello mommy so it's like marinated beef I also got the marinated chicken boneless thigh I got the marinated spare rib says you gotta be so this is pork I was really craving Buffy but I don't want to make it so I just got a little kit that you can just has all the ingredients and you just throw everything together because I this is a Korean stew it's called unsuitable so it's it's like a spicy Korean stew made with tofu and like eggs and seafood and you can put like beef in there - it's up to you but this is a little kit it comes with the tofu and the sauce so you just throw it together the only thing is you have to add are like the extra ingredients that you want to add which I thought was really really cute do they have like a mild and as a medium spice and then the extra space extra hot spicy so I got that one plain me so we have dark chicken thighs that can make coconut tender a chicken and then I just don't you can breasts for my little fur babies because they be eating egg whites for two weeks now and then I have dropped like freshman classes so the one I showed you is like throw them that's one's freshly made and then I just got some brown rice and white rice so this is um good meat so sesame leaves you can eat that with meat and then some chinese phosphate tips and buy ties or bok choy and then enoki mushrooms some cucumbers and some green onions I'm planning I'm just making because I defrost this but I never cooked it so I need to cook this quickly before it goes bad but this was just from giant when I went there to get some frozen food so I'm going to make that with some green beans for lunch   presentations not the prettiest but this tastes really really good you guys I'm gonna bring this bowl up to my husband  my cup of tea that I just got from each part I have blackboard opened and I have my class journal open I've got a new post for my sweet friends I'm gonna respond to that friend yeah and then I'm just gonna catch up on some YouTube with my teacher friends and then yeah I'm probably just gonna read the rest of the afternoon and journal and do what I've been thoroughly enjoying the last couple of days um I also need to check my email and see if there are any updates this is just like it's so crazy
