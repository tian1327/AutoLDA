  good morning it's Sunday it's the eighth Sunday I'm self quarantined in China because of cover 90 it hunts it took me quite a while to adjust to this stuff quarantine life and keep my days at home positive productive and healthy so I just wanted to share a chill sign name a self quarantine life with you I like to put on some relaxing music and start my day with coffee I recently bought this espresso machine on Alibaba for just $50 and man it was such a life changer I didn't realize I was so addicted or coffee until I had my first step after two whole months I'm still learning to use this machine and my latte coating cool art looked like a piled foamy poop but I thought could become a new hobby some other days we'll see I used to listen to the music morning when I was a motivated college student tryna get into management consulting but as I come to terms with Maya life rapidly converging to the mean I realized it's not a best way to fight off my crazy internal monologues or the catastrophes going on around the world or even worse a quote from Trump so instead I put on some music and just pry myself with a good mood while lighting my internal monologue thread itself out with a clear mind I'm looking forward to the day having a clean and pleasant environment is extremely important if you spent an extensive time at home it makes you look forward to being productive and taking proper care of yourself for lack of better words it's important to feel nice if you want to have a nice day my tip for organizing is to keep everything you don't use out of side I would also recommend adding your favorite plan or piece of art to your desk so you associate a good positive mood with work if there's no real work to do but I feel like if I just spent all day watching a play except feel like I didn't do anything so I drop down a few things on my bullish or knowledge so that's my tip this I'm allowed to feel accomplished for the day I also wrote down some fun things that I felt inspired to do I'm really into making over my room lately so I wrote down some DIY projects and shopping lists I'm still trying to figure out a bullet journal system but for now I'm just trying out whatever comes to mind hopefully in a few weeks that all evolved into a system of its own working on my own without any real deadlines has always been really hard for me because I'm very easy to distract it and just have week well power in general this is and I like to use psychology which happens to be what I studied in college to motivate myself motivation as I understand it is basically using rewards to reinforce desirable behaviors any punishment to eliminate undesirable ones so I noticed what I do in a day basically fall into three categories what I should do like editing a video or filing taxes things that could be enjoyable but just takes a little bit of effort so mentally I feel like avoiding it there are all the things that I just want to do like finding a new rug for my bedroom and also there are things that are just a pure waste of time like scrolling through Instagram aimlessly and enough spending hours on it without even realizing it so I like to use that what I want to do category as a rewards to reinforce what I should do so here's how it works I would tell myself that if I finish editing this video I can go on Taobao and find a rug from a bedroom versus if I didn't finish it by the end of this week then for the next week I can't wash best-dressed who will admire Ashley's aesthetics and cry over her post-graduation existential crisis video for like the third time because I really - every single bit of it it sounds like a very simple system but what it does is it associates rewards it's doing what you should do and Punishment with wasting time so you naturally like getting work done and avoid wasting time well that sounds ideal doesn't it it's lunch time and I'm making myself grilled chicken I used to eat poorly for the first several weeks of myself isolation but in time I realized the key to keeping a healthy diet when you're out surrounded by tons of food is to play what you eat maybe a day in advance you don't have to be very rigorous at the plan at all so for example today I plan to eat coffee and cookies for breakfast grilled chicken for lunch bananas and some yogurt for dinner and maybe some eggs for a late-night snack if I'm feeling hungry this is my diet so far I know it doesn't make much sense but I'm working on it there is no set quantities and I want to make sure to allow myself at least one meal every day where I can just eat to my heart's content this is so that I can take my mind off of food and won't constantly think about it throughout the day when I'm at home it's very difficult to exercise it's funny because I used to be all about at home work Alison was really scared to go to the gym because I was so embarrassed by my clumsy forms but I've been going to the gym and like maybe lifting some weights for the past couple years and now I really drag doing a homework house because somehow I feel like I'm above it I'm not really these at home work house can be really challenging and I'm just lazy and have kind of given up on fitness after being the slug for three months I find watching workout videos from my favorite Fitness youtubers to really help me get out of a fitness Alum I'll link some of my favorite channels below I found this new channel today called match fit and she does at home workouts with great music so I wanted to follow along with her today I actually posted an Instagram story of my workout and send pictures to some of my friends who are also in self quarantine I'm usually pretty anti social media because I think it's honestly kind of rude to post little things about your life and demand people's attention on it when they don't have a lot to get out of it but social media in this strange time of social distancing really offers a level of comfort and companionship that is unparalleled in any other form I desire to light a candle and make macrame cents really helped me calm down if you tend to overthink or are prone to anxiety like me I would highly recommend using your favorite candle instance or a diffuser whatever is your poison it really changes the vibes of your space immediately the candle I'm using is amber and moss from PF candle and you can get Urban Outfitters I picked up Mac from me because I needed to make a plant hanger for my roommate over but it turned out to be an awesome way to create some peace and quiet amidst all the craziness going on around the world I feel like growing up I've never had a hobby like everything I learned I was a kid was more for my resume it was never for fun but since I started working I realized hobbies are actually so important because they give you a sense of accomplishment while you're relaxing like it's okay for me to have a day of just relaxing if I finished a big project but I will never never be able to take a day just because and feel good about it at the end of the day so I guess the chill hobby like macrame it's perfect for someone who likes to feel accomplished even on a day of relaxation I'm pretty happy with this end result but let me tell you there's just too much editing between the actual long and painful process of making this and what you just saw so that's the last macrame am I ever gonna make I'll see you next week damn I just made a commitment okay bye
