 hi everyone welcome back to my youtube channel and today we are gonna go survive the coronavirus so I have been in quarantine for about three weeks now and I thought you know what let's vlog today let's show you guys what I'm doing and like how I'm surviving alright so basically I'm going to Starbucks right now Petco because I really need to get fish food and I also need to run a Dollar Tree because I don't have any pencils don't have any pens and I also need a new notebook so we are going a few places that we really shouldn't be right now because this virus is to the point where we honestly shouldn't be going anywhere but I really need to go to these places and joining us for these places will be a face mask and gloves so just a little outfit of the day yeah excuse my room it looks terrible we're gonna get into that later on in the video but I'm wearing this death row records shirt that I got from Spencer's and then I have these orange like I can do like swim trunks honestly but I've been wearing them as shorts they're pretty cute I think I got them from H&M and then I am wearing Air Force Ones so alright so I'm gonna grab all the stuff that I need before we head out and then I guess I'll talk to you guys in the car alright so I'm probably gonna end up just going to Petco first then Dollar Tree and then Starbucks because I'm pretty sure Petco changed their hours to where they're only open till like 6:00 now and right now it's 5:22 so I gotta go right now alright so I just got here you can see right there there she is I'm about to go in got to put on my face mask and gloves so I don't die but this really beat home would be though though this happens all the time so I'm really not surprised but I bought a betta fish um I honestly was just thinking in my head I was like who's taking care of these fish who's buying fish right now during the coronavirus so I wanted to give her a home or Hema home actually so I put her down like in the middle thing and I like put that there so that like no one can you know so there's people staring at me right now but like I'm going in a Dollar Tree to get the other stuff I need so yeah all right so I'm officially been to Petco and Dollar Tree now I'm just sitting out of Starbucks and go home and yeah that's it give me a grande when I heard a venti belay it's okay it's fine it's all good but can we talk about how dirty the front of my car is from all this damn pollen like look at it you so nasty hey this is basically what I got I just got a planner a journal thing some candy some pins and then at Petco I got that  and then I got some food of course so yeah so come back home now um still sipping on the strawberry cider refresher with lemonade and you guys have not tried out let me put you on the best ring at Starbucks like soba anyways the point of this video was basically for me to show you guys like what to do when you're stuck in your house for quarantine like what you guys should do what I'm doing so that's what we're gonna get into let's do that right now all right so I'm sure this probably seems very stupid to you guys but I basically just in the blue book I wrote down everything I need to get done so basically all the tanks and stuff that I need to do water changes on bring out my clothes organize the bonus room clean my bathroom and then like over here I had also done like my daily planner which is like film a YouTube video clean my room water changes on fish tanks so basically like this will be more broken down detail-oriented more like my life stuff like I'll do like anything health rate anything health-related anything planning related in this this is more for just like actual plans appointments or like you know the the main things alright so I'm done journaling I wrote down just like a lot of stuff like I wrote down some work out things I can do for next week I wrote down like the stuff I need to get done tonight so why not let's start this I need to clean my room because yeah it looks atrocious but yeah I'll check in with you guys when I get like these clothes taken downstairs and my room a little better all right so my goomah room is pretty much clean I did a lot and yeah so I'm currently talking with my friend Lee seriously hi this is who literally I started my youtube career with like her and I like we go way back we did troupe

the same but except for mints tank I haven't worked on that yeah I'll do that in the morning because I'm pretty sure it's like 4 a.m. right now it's yeah it's literally three thirty five right now but yeah their tanks look pretty good if you guys actually want to see more of my fish because I have a lot um let me know I would literally love to do a whole video on all my animals and fish and show them to you guys but I also don't want to put you guys to sleep with my useless information alright so I basically wanted to come on here and in the video because it's about 4 a.m. now but I just want to say that I had a really great day um I did go out of the house and like go do stuff but it was good to get a new betta fish and honestly I felt very motivated today because I clean my room for God's sake look at that basically I just want to like tell you guys that although this coronavirus is literally terrible and it feels like we're all trapped and like we're all gonna die just stay motivated stay positive and like try to do things that benefit you like cleaning your room like I you I wasted like or I don't want to say wasted I used 5 hours of my time that I had nothing else to
