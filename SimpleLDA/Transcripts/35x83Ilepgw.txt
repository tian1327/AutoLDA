  No hello good morning I was supposed to be up a lot earlier than I am right now I'm on a trail run and it's 948 I was supposed to be up and out the door at like 8:30 and I'm an hour behind I don't know today I'm just kind of like ouch I was like up early and I went to bed just fine but it was one of those things or I don't know I just like something that looked at two stalks all morning I don't know what got over me I'm gonna drink my kombucha where's my hairbrush where are you where did you go I'm not kidding you when I tell you that I just looked for my hairbrush for like 10 minutes and forgot that I've been putting it a new place in a drawer in my bathroom not my usual place which by my usual place I mean four different spots around my room that it could possibly be and I usually know where they are but instead I'm choosing to try to give myself new habits where this is goes in a drawer but I forget every single morning so my hair is very fuzzy today so we're just gonna have to deal um recently in a live stream I mentioned some study about how positive compliments were able to make a plant grow while negative retorts and and negative things like out loud to a plant made it like not be as loud can you hear Randy the Roomba because he's working working hard I'm gonna try this thing now that I'm trying to vlog more where this is our basil plant don't think we've named him either barrier barack that's been our name for him and then this is leafy so every day when I leave here I'm gonna say something beautiful to them like you are stunning today you are growing may your leaves be green forever leafy I hope that you one day sprout a root you get gorgeous I made it love this hike I feel like I'd be going insane I don't know about this little secret spot but also you see the tree way over there I'm gonna go there not yet though I got a ways to go first oh that's so sumed in but um just listening to a podcast I'm actually listening to it but I'll tell you what about it would have done because I want to like keep that heart rate up  my favorite spot see what you can see today it's a little stormy we'll see if I can cut it short or Al FAW be forced to cut my trail run short downtown LA I think that's the water can't quite see it today very weirdly it's like I was I always tried to talk to you guys with the zoom turned all the way in it's a weird I was gonna vlog on the way up here then I was like no I was gonna say it's like chilly today and then suddenly the Sun starts to come out like right about now but I love this little hidden trail no I will not tell you how to get here this is like my savior this entire quarantine just to be able to come up here I feel like I'm not in LA anymore I feel like I'm in Colorado there's just like no one around no one knows about this trail and I get to just look at houses that I'm one day gonna buy oh this gorgeous mansion over there do you need two tennis courts tell me what does the house a mansion sorry a McMansion for my OC lovers out there what do you need two tennis courts for wouldn't you rather have a giant pool and like a pergola and like an outdoor grill and like patio area for entertaining that's a highlight but I don't get the whole point of two tennis courts unless you're Venus and Serena but once they have their own house random thoughts I'm right now re listening to one of my favorite podcasts it is the skinny confidential podcast called him and her with Lauren Everett's Bostick and her husband Michael Bostick I don't know why it took me so long to find their podcasts they have given me life and right now listening to my favorite episode I never thought I'd be a podcast person for a long time was like in how do I listen to music I don't I don't really wanna lose someone talk that sounds boring but I don't know I've been really into podcasts I like the idea of learning and having my mind gain new perspective while I'm doing something mindless like dishes or brushing my teeth in the morning when those are prime prime time hours for me to get anxious or to doubt myself and it's been really nice to just kind of I don't know listen to other people's perspective um podcast number 238 it's with EDM I let part 2 it's called how to achieve your goals enjoy success strive for more and hold yourself accountable all while avoiding burnout episode 238 on the him and her podcast I never thought hey I'd be a podcast person and be I never thought I would realism to the same piece of audio for the second time because I am only like 18 minutes into it and I already just feel so much better and ready to conquer my goals and not doubt myself I swear anyone and everyone out there listen to this like sorry with my air pods and I hear my backpack jingling and I was like there's someone behind me scary times but okay go get my heart rate back up just uh I feel at peace I should have gotten up earlier but you know what why do I always beat myself up for dumb things I'm here now and I want to enjoy it she's a mom  you see you're walking down yeah she's a Mona Lisa everyone's man enough to see there must be something bad features you found her beauty goes much deeper once you get to meet her she's a monitor I made it to the tree I take my favorites you like I'm in like a storybook I've climbed this tree I want to play guitar by this tree but also getting crazy cold and foggy but it's weirdly sunny ah so I'm like oh because they're late starts today I don't they can go all the way down like I normally do I've gone about 1.4 miles but it's already 11 o'clock and I got to go to the bike shop and I gotta go start work for the day and I kind of smell so that's gonna be a fun combination I do just need like earlier 500 calories is good I guess my normally strive for like 600 just because my body type requires a lot of cardio and I've been noticing dramatic changes with just adding car do more cardio than then I used to okay one last look at my little spot three little accomplishment I was all the way over there when I filmed you first I just feel so like lost in nature and it's just my it's my favorite and I'm happy to bring you along with me on my second day of reblogging not bad not bad oh gosh I am so sweaty yes so it's 11:15 I'm now headed to a bike shop in West Hollywood they're open I have my mask don't you worry to get some air put in my bike tires and get a bike pump because I'm actually giving this bike to my roommate Shelby we're doing a swap the whole long story but I need to like dry off a little bit but I totally brought a hairbrush and some perfume so that I don't scare away everyone in the store  okay not bad thank God for a hairbrush I will say though little perfume I smell I need more long sleeve workout clothes because this is the second time I've worn this is anybody else sometimes rewear workout clothes you're just gonna shower after anyway just me okay cool I gotta go pretend like I know stuff about bikes  all right got air in the tires I gotta say one of the best like positive things of coronavirus has been the fact that there's no traffic in LA anywhere I just made it to West Hollywood in like 17 minutes like I love that that is amazing but yes like I was saying earlier me and she'll be my roommate we're doing a little bit of swap because early on and Quarantine she bought a Nintendo switch she was like let's play Mario Kart and let's play Mario Party and I was like first of all shook cuz hey I love videogames and I've always wanted to switch and I was like absolutely I support this decision Shelby this sounds amazing I think it would be really fun for us to do together as roommates and has like a few weeks into the quarantine she'll be remembered that she just sold like video games that much which is totally fine not everyone's into video games and all of that and so then then she was talking about selling it and then I had already purchased some games on it and now I play Animal Crossing and a half of that just dance game that I love so I would kind of chatted and I was like what if I buy the switch off of you and so then we kind of realized that I have this really nice bike that I never use and I'm just not the strongest biker I do like biking but I just haven't had anyone to bike with so it's just been in our garage she was like what if you gave me the bike and I gave you the switch and I was like absolutely that sounds like a great trade I'm also gonna pile on some other stuff on top of it because the switch is like four hundred dollars and my bike when it was new was also four hundred dollars three four hundred dollars something like that but you know because it was a gift and also I've ridden it maybe like four times so it's pretty much brand new so yeah I told her I was like I'm gonna get the bike like get some air I got a bike pump for the tires and so I'm gonna go back and do that and so it was so funny cause texting her and I was like oh Shelby now I kind of want a bike because if you're gonna have a bike now I would have someone to bike with and she was like oh my god I know yeah maybe we can just like fine like a different biker I can you like wrench one I don't know not the strongest biker but it's just it's nice to figure out different reasons to get outside and Animal Crossing is a real thing a real addiction of mine I didn't play yesterday at all which was shocking for me but you know I got to really keep an eye on my hands I have probably like two videos two edits before I can even think about responding to any emails or planning out anything I think I want to do a Taylor Swift livestream this week we've got some new news we have some rumors and I think that would be really fun and so I have to plan that ants a patreon stuff but my mind gets so overwhelmed sometimes that I'm like I need to focus on one thing at a time so right now I'm gonna get home probably eat and then I need to start editing my Zoey's extraordinary playlist season 1 recap because I don't think that video is going to perform very well because I want it to I really want it to but I'm just trying to make videos now that make me happy things that I just enjoy talking about and the season finale for Zoe's extraordinary playlist was like a week ago now so I don't really know people are looking up reviews they might be I don't know what's quarantine people are spending a lot more time at home streaming stuff so I gotta go do that and just yeah it's crazy how when I start my days with a workout how it just sets the tone for the rest of the day I feel better even though I got a late start later than I wanted to I just feel better that run that trail run was everything that podcast was everything listening to it I was just writing down ideas for my own exciting stuff that are probably need to be announcing on this vlog Channel Oh so hopefully you guys could come along on that journey with me I just sent an exciting DM to this small business that I really really like and yeah there's some exciting stuff that I need to continuously speak out loud and remind myself that I have exciting things on the horizon in those moments where I'm feeling very uninspired and unmotivated so down you go okay time to drive back home Cooper's whining as usual the switch has been made the Shelby has the bike the switch is now gonna remain exactly where it always has been but I gotta go get on the smelly and do work okay so it's not 3:20 I posted my vlog it's live I'm happy with how it turned out but now I'm suddenly in a whole other different mood because I think we just found out that the lockdown in Los Angeles is going to last and through August that's three months from now I am very upset it's not an official order like I had it happened like when I was in the middle of like finishing up a thumbnail so of course I was like wanting to you know click on everything and read things more but I was like I really just have to like focus on this video get it posted and so now I'm like I wanted to like search online but like turn the camera on cuz it's nothing's been officially said it's Tuesday May 12th 3:23 so there's just like there's like something it says coronavirus confusion la mayor tries to douse panic over likely stay at home order extension los angeles mayor had to jump into damage control mode after confusing comments the top public health official in the county made about stay at home restrictions going deep into this summer I think quite simply she's saying that we're not going to fully reopen Los Angeles and probably anywhere in America which is fine without any protections or any health orders in the next three months just before I think we know what's going to what the sentence I just read said I think we know it's going to be longer than three months making the whole situation clear as mud again okay I need to send this to my roommates cuz we're all just kind of like panicking I'm gonna go fly somewhere I'm gonna go fly to Mexico or Hawaii and just stay there I can't I can't live in this basement any longer this is the only sunlight that I get that's it and that's not a lot I can't I'm gonna cry I can't do this let me read more of this people need to know whenever possible that it is safer to stay at home there's no radical changes in the next week coming that doesn't mean three weeks from now six weeks from now two months from now we won't continuously edit that order still with August looking like the new benchmark public health director had also told supervisors Tuesday that an official announcement on extending the state of an order would comment tomorrow's briefing guys I still have so much work to you today I was in a great mood and now I'm just like on the verge of tears I can't believe that this is really happening but we're in this and then I have this whole internal battle of like feeling selfish that I'm like oh no I didn't even realize that there's a giant stain on my shirt okay remove the stain shirt guys I'm just like what is it like where you are can you comment down below and if you feel safe to do so can you share where you live like whether it's a state or a county or country just and what it's like there for you because I'm like I'm gonna lose my mind I'm trying so hard to like stay positive and I'm gonna turn 30 I'm gonna be alone how am I supposed to meet a guy I think I should turn the camera off before I yeah that sucks goodbye summer I guess how come I have I've been so good this is just other people not taking it seriously like I don't understand yeah okay I know those from the camera off hello again um it's a few hours later I needed to just like take a break you know I'm outside playing animal crossing i love that my um now i can say that it's my Nintendo switch cuz the swap happened fits perfectly on my iPhone phone stand so I don't have to hold this either it's amazing but um yeah I'm hearing that we're going to be stuck indoors for three more months really threw a wrench in my productive day today although I will say I am very happy with the amount of work that I got done today and I already edited tomorrow or started editing tomorrow's vlog today's vlog for you oh I got to go with daily vlogger it out oh my gosh started editing that so I guess I am okay with the amount of work I've gotten done today just like oh I don't want to think about I don't anyone think about it's not official because tomorrow is apparently the press briefing where they're gonna talk about it more because apparently since I'm gonna put you down cuz you're hurting my hand since that news got out that we might be staying stuck indoors for three more months there's been all this backlash and the mayor came out and said something like just because like that might not be the case we just have to like watch the numbers and stuff and so there's a good possibility that it won't be like that but I don't know I just where's my entire summer gone feels like maybe maybe even the whole year gone like if I if this goes through until Thanksgiving when I'm supposed to be with my cousin's in New Orleans it would be very very upset and then and then even saying that those words just feel selfish coming out of my mouth because we're in a pandemic and everyone in the world is going through something hard and I still have a job so like Who am I to sit here and complain but it's just like this is just the feelings I'm feeling so many things and I'm just like all I want to think about right now is just playing a little bit of animal crossing or set a timer for myself so that I can go back to editing because I want to get Zoey's extraordinary playlist edited we'll see just came back inside I was getting a little bit cold out there and decided that I needed some mac and cheese what comfort food you say no not me mac and cheese is made added in sriracha a little bit of sharp cheddar cheese and
