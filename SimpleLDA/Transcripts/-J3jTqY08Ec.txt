    all right we are starting our day finally 10 o'clock we're actually going since well technically yeah he woke me up at 6 o'clock with a fever so she took some medicine and went back to bed told her to keep in bed and not go to school we knew she was probably getting sick last night even though she wasn't testing with the temperature hang on a second it was hard to get through my neighborhood when cars come down the hill anyway so we knew she was possibly getting sick last night she kind of felt a key and but she wasn't testing with the temperature the highest we could get it was like 96.1 you think so we just put her in bed sitting her to bed like 8:30 I think she was kind of doing her neuro routine and I was like like hanging out just not going to bed and I was like what are you doing you don't feel good so she went to bed and woke up sick at 6 o'clock this morning so she's still in bed and just took some more medicine it's been four hours since she took medicine before Jason is on a conference call for work and then he is gonna go meet with a rep in person he was supposed to go to Portland last Sunday for a shoe convention I think it was a shoe convention um sometimes it's either shoe convention or like a doctor convention but this was a shoe one so he's having one of the reps meet him at a hotel in Bellevue and they're gonna show it you know he'll show Jason the shoes so for those of you that are new we are going to do with little updated video Jason and I are this afternoon talking about this whole coronavirus here in washington and how it affects our family because i think it's good to see a perspective of what it's you know what it's doing and how it you know how it's affecting people normal people and in the small community and we are the epicenter of this virus and i not that everyone is going to see this video but our friends and the people who follow from across the world will see what's going on and see what they can maybe do where they live and hopefully you'll be able to stop the spread of this virus and I feel like our little town and the city of Seattle is doing things in the right way in the right pattern and the right timeframe and that's you know sometimes the hard pill to swallow and you know it's hard to do with Nona business as well and when you have a job and all that kind of stuff oh he knows so anyway we're gonna do that video later this afternoon but up my life continues so we're gonna do a separate video just kind of showing what it looks like does that bee have coronavirus there's a really high chance she does honestly like person toes matched oh my nose they match the symptoms that the rest of us have had lately really closely they're not allergy since I was even though we also have allergy symptoms but if an itchy nose isn't proof that we have allergies I don't know what it is but it also there's people I hate when people park next to you and I'm trying to do this awkward ingen right that's better now knowing those next to me and I think I just passed a cop so we're in the clear I went to the dollar store and then taking pants to Kaylee she wore the wrong pants for PE day today and so I'm taking her son like yoga pants and your genes because that's not gonna work for I think it's running day today but I like drive I'm gonna catch you up really quick there's a really high chance that what we have had is the corona virus and it's very mild if you don't have these heightened you know sensitivities and whatnot out Pam all right now I'm not driving this is a better scenario all right so while there's a really high chance that what we have is her have had an ally has right now is the virus we're getting mild symptoms because we're healthy and we're not falling in this demographic of high-risk categories if we get a virus it's not gonna attack our lungs it's not gonna give it a some ammonia and it's not gonna make this pass away we don't know I'm not gonna get tested because they first of all they're telling you even if you do have sometimes to stay home and contact your doctor if you don't get better we get better 24 hours later so we don't call a doctor we don't do anything different the difference is I keep my kids home I am keeping them quarantine for another 48 you know for 48 hours after they've been better what not 24 hours after they've been better and no fewer and what not and then I'll send them back to school but I also I'm keeping him home in general I'm when they get home from school they wash their hands and we'll talk about this a lot with Jason in a video that I'll do with him but I'm trying to do my part to not spread it and that we'll talk about that later so she is gonna stay home from school today I am at the dollar store right now because Jason sent a message to our friends last night who is the principal at our kids middle school I can't even imagine I cannot even imagine the stress and the hassle that she is in right now people think that she has a decision of closing schools she doesn't it's not her decision but the amount of work is taking to prep work to make it happen if it's going to happen or not happen is probably really really stressful I mean he made some kind of a comment yesterday in a text to her basically saying I know you're probably not that busy your plates not that full or anything like yeah her place is not full or anything she has three kids and a husband and she's a principal and she also teaches online classes to colleges anyway not busy at all and so I'm gonna go here to the dollar store and I'm gonna get her a plate I'm gonna fill it with some treats and a cold beverage and put it in a little care package drop it off at the middle school they are not allowing volunteers to come to the school so I don't think I'll be able to see her but I'm gonna drop it off at the front office and hopefully that will help her get through the day or at least be able to relax tonight and I'm also getting some wrapping paper and some supplies for birthday presents for the kids normally I would strap it in the white butcher paper that I've got but the bags that I got to wrap all their birthday presents and are really really cute and you'll get it later I haven't shown you they're so cute and it there's a theme and so I'm gonna try and go along with that theme for their birthdays and I'll have to wrap one at a time because anyway you'll see soon I promise you you will see soon but I'm gonna go and get some supplies from the dollar store and then run that start to the middle school Kaylee's pants to her at the high school and then go home and hopefully Jason will be home soon after that and we can do our little sit-down video check on Abby see how she's feeling and kind of go from there I think I might I think the elementary school PTA president who's gonna pick up Chelsea from school today because she's gonna get her daughter talking to her like we'll talk about this in the other video I don't want to like make this one like a ton of like Burbidge because I was talking to her today at the bus stop and the amount of stuff that she's doing just for being a PTA president is incredible we'll talk about that later for now let's go to the dollar store all right okay noisy out here but I've got a gift bag and then I just got a few things to give my friend here I've got a little Sudoku book and a book to read I don't know what that one's about but I kind of looked good for a dollar and then I've got some bath bombs and some of those shower bombs as well as some face wipes and then I got some candy for her so the idea is I know she's got a lot on her plate so I've got her this plate I'm so good I know she's got a lot on her plate with all this stress at school so I just wanted her to relax and take her mind off of her worries and then I found the perfect wrapping paper to go with the gift bags I already got and then look at these bows look at those fools I normally don't worry about bows but these things are perfect and you'll see you later why so I'm just gonna wrap this stuff up really quick and then take it over to the school alright so got that all ready to go and they pass like oho there's a car alright take care bye like two star-crossed lovers crossing paths in the night you said it over to his second conference of the day when we go ahead and check on Abby I think I might just work on the computers Jason's not gonna be more than an hour hour and a half I think and I want to be ready to film that second video for you guys just got an official word from the governor of Washington that he is closing all school districts in three counties King so hamish and another county basically all of the big cities and I don't know if Abby knows yet she's home sick she's gonna be home sick tomorrow but that's right now she's home until the end of April they're officially calling it until April 24th which is technically three days after our vacation ends now we don't have to worry about being tired when we come back we can just come home and sleep if we actually get to go I'm actually worried about like the hotel we're going to and I know what we're gonna do but I'm gonna go and tell Abby the news Alexa passed music school is technically canceled tomorrow no until April 24th governor just called it we haven't gotten word from the district yet but that's just a formality the governor didn't require all districts to close down don't be excited or anything yeah I really hope we get to go I hope our resort doesn't shut down now we got to find something to do inside all that I'm right when the weather finally gets good huh you don't feel really good you know it's just you don't have enough energy to do anything but you get bored doing nothing just keep drinking that water that's gonna be a little bit longer we've convinced dad I sent him a message earlier today I don't know an hour ago and I was like you're gonna be right by chick-fil-a so can you get some for your sick daughter okay you have cups that one is over there I guarantee you that okay I'll show him the stack that you brought down that I brought down earlier for you anyway we convinced him to give us the chick-fil-a for the sick one and then he just sent me a text like ten minutes ago and he's like hey we're gonna be a little bit longer here but where's the stack Oh dad loaded it where did he put in all these cups every single one of these except for this guy here that's all of these cups right here we're in Abby's room stinker she's kind of silly I gotta put all this stuff away alright it's officially official kids are out of school until April 24 I'm not gonna move from this room because this is where the good light is um not only did the governor declare school canceled but the district just sent out a message saying that it is canceled sorry my allergies it's like the worst time to be touching your eyes it's with the stupid virus and they also they're obviously gonna have to like update some information we'll talk about this more in our other video that I'm gonna do a taste in eventually if you still at home they are talking about waiting any missed hours beyond a certain date if we can't make them up once we do return to school which is nice because we would be going to school all summer long at this rate we would basically like not get a summer break so that's nice I don't know it's hard for everything so we'll talk about that later but Jason's not home yet and he doesn't know when he's gonna be home and Abby and I really want chick-fil-a so I'm really anxious Abby do you want to just go okay we're gonna go but also because I'm feeling anxious and I didn't know for sure school was cancelled and all that kind of stuff I also just got really nervous about our trip to Hawaii so I emailed the owner of our unit that were renting through verbo I've been in communication with him and I was asking if we could add at an extra day to art so we have flight we have a night flight and hate not having a hotel to be at during the day before the night flight so he said yes you he has some extra days so I was confirming with him that we probably would want to add a day to be able to work that through but then he called me and he's like you know what because I asked him about like the worry of all this virus stuff and are they gonna close the resort am I gonna lose my book hangar what is the feel on the island and he lives in California but he's in very close contact with the airlines and with the resort itself and he's a part of the HOA because he owns the unit and so he's in the communication with a lot of people in Hawaii and he said everything's fine yes there's reported cases in Hawaii but they're doing what they need to do probably gonna close down schools there eventually but at the resort he said they're doing all the you know cautionary things they're having everything wiped down multiple times during the day they have Sanitation stations set up they have sanitizer set up they have their cleaning staff cleaning all around the clock sanitizing the rooms more than they would on a regular basis which I don't know what that says they have a liability themselves if someone got sick while they were at the resort and so they have to go above and beyond and make sure that their resort is clean and so at the Hanalei Kai which is where we're staying is so far staying open he's like you know we have a couple weeks left before you get here I will be in touch with you if anything changes and it was just nice to like talk to him he's like it's gonna be okay and I told him I'm not worried about getting sick I'm not worried about taking care of my own family we're in quarantine now here at home and so you know he's in California and I told him I'm from Washington and he's like okay so you know what's going on and you know I'm like yeah because it's hitting Washington in California first and so I said I'm just gonna be cautious and I'm gonna come into your state area into Hawaii healthy and safe and do the things I need to keep myself clean so it was nice to talk to him and kind of be a reassured that at least for right now they're very comfortable with people coming into the state coming to the islands coming to the resort Abbi let's go but I'm just a feeling so anxious because so many things are written you know stacking up against this trip and I just don't to cancel but I also might try and convince Jason to let us stay forget believe they don't have school I don't know the only problem has work and money of course renting it oh he also said but he said you know book it through me personally he's like send me a personal message if you want to add an extra day or three or whatever you want to add and I'll have you send me a direct check afterward after we decide that you're gonna stay so that you don't have to pay the verbal fees so that'll save us he said it could caught it could save me like forty fifty dollars a day with that booking so that would really really help and change our mind whether we stay an extra day but then I have to look and see if there was a fee to change our flight I don't know I gotta talk to Jason about that because we don't have to go to school for a whole week after we get back now all right right as we were deciding to go and get our own food Jason text me and said hey so guy I'm leaving in five minutes so he is almost home with our food it's 3:30 Kaylee is really overwhelmed at school she's probably on the bucks now she's really overwhelmed and I don't blame her so I want to be able to like talk to her when she gets home here in the next few minutes kind of bring her back down she's just you know it's just teenagers aren't getting information from wherever they're getting it and I want to calm her down about it and and then we're gonna set up to film this video yeah chick-fil-a has arrived Abbi your drink is here
