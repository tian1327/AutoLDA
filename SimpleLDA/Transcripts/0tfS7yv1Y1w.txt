 hello and welcome to Ella Franks YouTube channel okay boy I'm going nuts it's whatever day it is which I'm gonna say I'm not during this blog but we're in quarantine quarantine for about a little bit over a week so I don't know what it looks like out there we step up a quite a bit but at some point we need to get some more food so that's probably gonna happen in this blog we're starting this day and I'm making some sweet pancakes for me and my boyfriend it was supposed to be breakfast but it's like noon now so it's gonna be lunch problem is those we're already starting with a quarantine problem so warranty problem number one we don't have all the ingredients to make pancakes the last milk we finished it earlier this week or it kind of went bad mom my boyfriend and he went and did some grocery shopping the other day that's nice fishy so he got almond milk and I don't know for whatever he said he got it maybe there was no other milk available or he felt like we should be healthy problem is now that we're trying to do pancakes and I never made Swedish pancakes with anything other than regular milk before I am NOT the kind of healthy person as you guys probably have figure out if you watch my other videos I'm gonna try to make this with almond milk but we will see how it turns out but let's just start this vlog here it's a lot of crazy stuff going on along the way of this vlog so keep on watching if you haven't subscribed to my channel this is a perfect way of doing that because I'm probably gonna I post once a week I love watching youtube videos actually of people showing you what their city looking in quarantine and this is basically what quarantine looks like in LA so they help with me  you know making face I'm sorry - it's the ingredients that I have to play with today my boyfriend went and bought flour the other day he managed to finally get hands on it so that's we're thankful for here is the helmet pill I have butter 3 eggs and some salt so we were gonna go actually to Malibu today and I don't know drive around maybe get like an Amber Alert just today from the governor or a mayor of LA governor California telling everyone to stay home right before the weekend so I think a lot of people are actually like you know don't take this seriously and go out and we can figure that you know we want to take it seriously so we're not going anywhere also I got wine delivered today I can show you guys later but the FedEx guy that needed to take my ID and everything when he delivered it he was like shocked that we were home and I was like everybody's alright now what are you talking about so I guess that some people are not taking this seriously and I have a lot of thoughts about that Serena for example my home country I have a lot of Swedish followers that I know that like they're gonna go nuts now because that's a typical freakin Swedish mentality but people are like on Swedish social media on Instagram like oh my god self-quarantine today and then they have like 12 people in the apartment for a party later and I was kind of like that because I went to Mexico when the travel ban happened and I was not taking it seriously but take it from someone who's literally in a state of Mordor and that the east of this country are planning on actually ordering a real quarantine on New York in New Year see because it's so bad and it's coming here too so stay home okay  and this is how they turned out I eat them with some strawberry jam that's the only job we have right now okay let's try this and see if it's a big difference oh my god I already try them but it's not that big of a difference the only difference I would say is that they're not as sweet and they're a little bit more fake but I think my boyfriend told me he got gluten-free flour too so it's very healthy but it is the same and with the jam it kind of adds to sweetness so it's not that bad it's like 1:00 p.m. here so we're having one of those days what are we gonna do now I'm probably gonna clean a little bit that fragment I guess since we're in it all the time it gets fairly messy and then later we're basically going to the grocery store and going out there for the first time so the quarantine started and then you guys are gonna see what it looks like right now for people staying inside or keep it being outside I don't know because I haven't been out in a while then you guys are gonna sit also that if stores are good about the distancing what are the stores doing to keep you safe as I said before I feel like a lot of people are not taking this seriously so I know there's a lot of sounds right now because I have the dishwasher on I have the laundry machine on but I just want to show you the wine I got from WIC since everything is so hard to get ahold of right now I just figured I order the wine from link online they showed up on my Instagram feed they had a offer so I got four bottles for $33 including shipping it's impossible right now to get stuff delivered from like normal delivery services such as like Amazon or like instacart so that's why I tried this it's kind of tailored to what you like and you get to try new ones if new wines every month so we'll see if this is something that I sign up for for a longer time but as long as there's the quarantine so the update now is that all of most of our food we stock up before the quarantine started it's done and we need to go and get some things and I've talked to a couple of friends I signed up for Whole Foods prime delivery but that has kind of stopped working it's very hard to get a delivery slot and I feel like since everyone is quarantined people who like work with that delivery service isn't really you know working anymore because they're scared of their own safety so what me and my boyfriend are gonna do now is that we're gonna prepare ourselves to go out there for the first time since we got ordered to stay home and we're gonna go and try to get some groceries so we're gonna try to stock up and I kind of wanted to show you what it looks like in LA right now what it is available for us out there in the grocery store and how the streets are looking because this is the first time I'm going out since the order to stay home I think both me and my boyfriend extremely scared of getting the virus but right now we kind of want to go there before it gets too late so let's just like get our gloves on and clothes on we're gonna look like hit base but it's only because we're putting on code separate like not afraid to their way after or like I'm Kenya's throw into the laundry machine so I'm gonna get dressed and yeah we're going to the grocery store we were lucky that of man bought a long time ago these gloves when he handles meet these ones you can't get your hands on anymore so babe should we have one on each hand or should we have you don't want to have like two now when we're going out and out so everything we touch yeah should we have two should we save them but I mean you use this with you we should have two yeah better be safe than sorry  okay those are on I have a tea ready to go okay let's go no you're the key keeper I'm the credit card keeper I'm a boss you're the key keeper  you  okay I can't touch my face right now so that's why this little lovely hair is creeping in beneath my sunglasses we just finished at Whole Foods were on our way to Target right now because I see that I saw there was not a lot that there was a lot of produce produce if there's no horoscope no produce that's like you know cucumber like a lot of like vegetables and stuff but there was not a lot when it comes to rice pasta laundry detergent we need soap there's no soap so right now we're going to targets to try to find the other things that we didn't find at Whole Foods and I cigars also saw on the way in there was markings on the floor when you stood in the line to get into Whole Foods there were also they regulated how many people could be in the store at the same time so we practice social distancing they even sanitize the carts and the baskets so they're really good about it being sanitized and really good about following the rules but there was other people in the store there was one lady who touched every ginger in the whole frickin place yes they'll be careful like when you get home sanitize everything sanitize like the cucumber that like the produce you got every product you should sanitize it because there's people that are out there there are knots but yeah let's go to Target now and let's see how the situation looks like there  okay so that was target it was such a more stressful experience they did not have these social distancing rules I didn't have any lion anyone can walk into the store there was a lot of stupid like people everywhere and people didn't really care about social distancing and Target so you kind of felt like you know there was too much people in the store and there was too much people who weren't like close to you etc so it made that me a little bit uncomfortable so for sure I had to go to Target to get some of the stuff because all the stores are now are out of stuff so you need to go to several stores to get everything you need but in the future I will probably prefer to go to Whole Foods just because their staff was really really good at you know set it ties everything and making sure that you had enough the space between each other and everything like that but yeah so that right now we took off our gloves because after target gloves were so nasty so we took them off but I'm still not touching my face when we're getting back I'm for sure having a crazy shower next time you guys see okay guys I don't know what I'm doing with my hair let's take it up what we're gonna do is that something else you probably noticed is that I have lost a couple of nails so this is one of the issues so with this whole quarantine is that I can't go and get my nails done it so in Sweden I used to do my nails like by myself all the time but it was regular nail polish now I have acrylic nails which is creating issues so I'm gonna show you guys how to do your nails at home and kind of extension so it's gonna be really interesting this is this setup this is stuff that I had already before it's UV light for a yellow some gel polish regular polish I have some stuff in here too that you need for that but these are the things that I got new so I got these at Target yesterday actually it's a nail file thing that they use at the salons it seems to be a little bit more tailored to something you would do at home so I'm gonna try this and hopefully my failing filing is better I his Japanese nail files 10-pack just a bunch of them from Amazon's so they work on acrylic nails as well even if I'm not doing an acrylic I'm doing what does it call it's like gel dip so it's like more healthier for your nails then acrylics are it looks like it's easier to do at home - they had an acrylic tip or a Kelly kit - but I decided to go with this because I saw some YouTube videos on it and what I liked is that if you guys see here if the focus can be right they have the white tips so it looks like I can have some extensions when it comes to this kit as well so we'll see if that works out and even if this is probably not gonna be a step-by-step guide because I feel like there's already so many out there I can link some in the description that I used for this one I kind of just wanted to show you guys do-it-yourself kind of video included in this quarantine because I'm sure that a lot of more of you are gonna be quarantine in just a matter of time if you're not quarantine already and I feel like I'm not the only one who's gonna have this issue so I just wanted to give some inspiration to you girls or guys out there in case you have an issue with your nails breaking and you're in quarantine and you can't go to the nail salon so this is what my nail looks like right now I took away all the extensions that I had so now I'm going to use this that I bought to try to like file them and buff them a little bit and then we're going right into applying new tips      that was all I think this is my new nails I think this is all I obviously had too much wine at this point and we're gonna enjoy it there were several nights eating some great food but this is basically what quarantine looks like or stay home looks like in LA gonna finish the vlog here I hope you guys enjoyed it if you enjoyed it leave a like
