 I mean she's an introvert I'm gonna be I'm gonna be losing my mind probably by Saturday Monday morning first true weekday of the quarantine Casey's of course working from home but she usually works from home she's on some laundry right now is that like you're like avoiding the dry cleaner I am headed out here to the garage to clear this space out because there is food coming in to go in the freezer it is our six-month restocking of our food freezer the freezer not food fridge this stuff we make and put in there extra space this six months thank goodness we have it probably gonna have to move some stuff around because I still have quite a bit of food left and I have a whole bunch coming because we have upped our order this time but that's gonna have to wait until I get this out of the way cuz the guy is not gonna be able to bring it in Hudson is downstairs with Alicia and Dominick is at the grandparents he has been exported for the week they wanted him and we were more than happy to oblige so I'm gonna go get that area cleaned out longest way of electricity win food for six months so we can really hunker down aren't you excited I mean she's an introvert I'm gonna be I'm gonna be losing my mind probably by Saturday I have the Internet I have you guys well they're much different all cleared out because it's all going to actually take the ramp down and move it over today because I've got to get in the Attic get a few things out got to put a few things in there's some Christmas stuff here that Casey's mom had brought but I haven't been up in the attic since I think she brought it into in January so Wow my hair's looking awesome it's cuz I have not had a shower yet today but it's you know it's still early it's not noon yet I took advantage this morning of Dominic being at grandma grandpa's and Hudson's nurse being here for her so stayed up a little bit late last night watching a movie and decided to sleep in so I slept till like 9:30 this morning it was glorious it's a eerily quiet you know it's it's usually quiet in my neighborhood it's Monday on Mondays usually there's quite a bit of traffic going up and down our street today all you can hear her birds it's really weird we've never seen anything like this in at least in modern day society I hope the quarantines working we'll just put it that way I know this I am very happy I am very grateful that we have the ability to have food and that we have actually I built that pantry a few months ago with my father-in-law and we've been able to stock up and finding that fridge for what 65 70 bucks you're gonna get in so we have set ourselves up really well for a situation like this on top of the fact that Casey can work from home and that I mean I essentially work from home because of this so it's not changing a lot for us I am curious about tomorrow and Wednesday because tomorrow is st. Patrick's Day and I'm supposed to bartend and bartend on Wednesday cuz you know I work two nights a week I'm curious whether I'll have any business and I'm worried about the owner of the bar because I mean bars and restaurants kind of live on thin margins anyway and I have a lot of bar and restaurant friends from all over the world most of the ones here in the United States are the ones that I'm seeing having struggles right now friends in Ohio that I mean the bars are closed till April most of the bars in Vegas are closed until April I think MGM casinos are shutting down all of their properties it's I know this is crazy I'm hoping that things are put in place where rents don't need to be paid and stuff like that I mean I've seen that in a few places but I don't know how somebody in the service industry or retail can can make it through this I it's it's crazy I can't bartend from I mean I bartend from home but I can't make money bartending from home we we've all got to hang in there stick together hey good I hear a car wow there is light well I hope you guys are doing well in your situation okay I'm gonna shut the camera off and get this food supply here when he shows up any minute is it supposed to been here two minutes ago I think that's still not here I mean been there ten minutes since I signed out with you guys thought I'd show you something kind of cool while we wait I let me set this up okay tomorrow is Patrick today and a friend of mine I have another friend who is a youtuber I have several friends that are youtubers that from my old bartending days Vlad slick bartender check his channel now I'll put a link below but he shared this stuff called brew glitter and so I took some up because of Patrick's Day for tomorrow and it is edible glitter how cool is that for anyone who happens to come and see me tomorrow at work I'll be adding a little bit to the to the beer kind of cool right yeah it's drinkable tastes like water curious what tomorrow is gonna look like though alright just like the truck is here oh by the way the brute literacy comes in a little thing like that hello sir good how are you moved a bunch of stuff off the side so we could get to it but I did not get a chance to Noreen I think I've talked about it before but this is guaranteed Foods so if you are in this region like eastern portions of Kansas to some western portions of Kansas and Missouri and Iowa Nebraska maybe if you guys know in Arkansas no no Oklahoma so I've talked about them before Genki foods just go there I tell you what times like this I'm super happy to have this food service yeah I yeah I was actually a little stressed weather like it would get here in time that was a word that this quarantine was happening like right when it was come time for my six-month order but I mean good guaranteed they showed up it's going in there so we're good yeah love using these guys for over 10 years so we started with them before Hub City born great company bison I know quite a few of you are in this region of the country checked because right that is that that is all loaded up and he's rolling out and that freezer is so full that we had to lock the door so that the door doesn't end up getting pushed open and I had to take quite a bit of stuff out that like we use that freezer for I mean storage you know if I find a deal on hamburger I I buy some up for some bacon I buy it up didn't we you know keep some ice cream and stuff in here but this time not really any room for any extras so yeah the door is locked the best I tell you what that is peace of mind by the way this is not sponsored by guaranteed foods mentioning the brew Glitter earlier video not sponsored by brew glitter but yeah I I just endorse things that I enjoy that I like that I use I figure if you like something you should tell people right okay now I've got to get the ramp moved move the boys stuff back over on that side and get up in that attic by the way I also I think you've seen if you watch this long enough I crush Campins cuz I mean well I just throw away you recycle and you can make a little extra money from it Casey's parents have started crushing cans at their house also so they sent several bags so I think I probably should go sell some aluminum this week because kind of full militia is heading out the door I guess one of her dogs has been sick for a few days so she's gonna take him to the emergency vet keep Alicia and her family in your thoughts because sick dogs are no fun she said she'll do that tomorrow so thank you Alyssa right pretty good timing though I'm all done with my upstairs stuff now I can be down here I think Casey's kind of working down and up you got black cloth out of the Attic because when I sit down in front of the ring light to talk with you guys is a black background well it's because I hang that black cloth up behind me but it doesn't fill in the whole space so you can see the edges so grab another black cloth out of my Halloween box and that will get clipped to the ceiling behind me so that I don't have to edit the sides out of all the videos because it just makes it a pain in the butt oh okay so I actually didn't record much of anything after that moment except for about 15 more seconds where I said I was gonna talk about the coronavirus in fact check this out so let's figure that let's talk about the coronavirus but the truth is is that I I'm kind of unprepared to be talking about it in fact I don't know that I'm necessarily willing to try to go into detail about my absolute opinions about the coronavirus I feel like some of that could slide into politics and some of that could slide into I don't know things that we could argue about but mostly I wouldn't want to share anything that's incorrect and honestly things are kind of in the air right now we don't really know everything so I wouldn't want anyone to think that I'm an expert by any means but there are experts out there so do your due diligence pay attention to the source of what you're reading when it comes to what's being said what the laws are what the levels of contagion are whether you should be leaving your house or not the thing is that it just boils down to this don't panic like it just let's just let's just calm down keep a cool head pay attention to sources that we trust I see a lot of people on my soul to media sharing incorrect information and some of it is obvious you look and you see that it's essentially a website that's the new version of The Inquirer but some of the major news outlets have shared incorrect information as well as government officials so not not going to get off on that side of things but the most important thing I think we can do is to stay calm just realize we we are going to get through this this is going to be painful for a lot of us things are probably never going to be the same but every day is like that life changes every day on some level today this week this month this next three months could change exponentially but change is inevitable I just got done watching a video by Mark Rober and I'm gonna put a link in the description to this video in fact it's gonna be the first thing in the description so if you just scroll down find that click on it it'll take you to his video in fact if you want just go there right now come back to this point and you can pick up where we left off or go after this video watch it but if you leave now please come back but it talks about how easy it is to spread germs viruses from one person to another he spread this glow of the dark UV sensitive powder on the teachers hand and it's like you know handshake to everyone and then it got spread throughout this classroom it was kind of mind-blowing that to have this visual representation of just how connected we all are to bacteria and viruses how how how just prevalent they are watching it will definitely make you a little more diligent if you're not already being as diligent as you think you should because I'll bet you want to step it up we you know we think of the world as being such an enormous place but it didn't take long for the entire world to go into shutdown over this essentially invisible microscopic thing that that's taking us down is it's not aliens land on the planet it's not zombies wandering the streets that one's a little subjective if you caught the Walmart at any give it we can conquer this we can get through this if we just make sure we're practicing social distancing we have been hunkered down here as I mentioned in the video by the way I'm recording this on Wednesday that video that you watched was from Monday since then so much has changed that night we found out that school is cancelled for the rest of the semester god help us all anyone that's a parent that has a kindergarten through twelfth grade kid at home Wow anyone with high school kids good luck on keeping food in your cabinets and anyone with a first or second grader like Dominic what good luck keeping your sanity I know I'll be practicing some liquid therapy occasionally Tomic is coming back tomorrow from Grandma and Grandpa's guys just be kind to each other but be kind to each other from a distance I know that many of our viewers are highly susceptible to viruses immuno compromised I know that many of you are worried and and and you should be to some degree of course but we're gonna get through this if we're all on the same team if you are immunocompromised put your foot down don't interact with people keep everyone at their distance if you are taking care of someone who is compromised please do the same you know Hudson she's a pretty healthy girl I don't want to jinx us but she's doing pretty well Alisha is still coming to the house she's actually a very diligent person also she is her nurse she's helping out for now but we also don't know for how long Alisha will be able to keep coming to the house because she has four kids at home that now are out of school for six months I mean the kids don't go back to school til August there's no daycare so I you know I don't know how much time she'll be able to spend here with us another thing I want to talk about I am NOT going to be bartending for two nights a week for now because all bars and restaurants are shut down completely shut down except for carryout and delivery in fact tonight we ordered food from where I work just to try to support the business because they don't have their normal customers coming in there they're struggling restaurants and bars are I mean they are always on thin margins and so it's I'm actually really worried for my friends and family around the world that that work in the bar and restaurant industry it's probably in some of the most dangerous are as businesses that will shut down I would encourage you to order from your local restaurants get some carryout it get some delivery for that matter have just tell them look I want to pay by credit card and please leave it on my front step and I will come out and get it after you're going yeah I I don't know what else I can say right now I am going to be doing my best to get as many videos out to you as I can throughout this I mean it's really a nationwide quarantine I know that movie companies television production well movies have basically stopped production TV is I mean you're not talking about sitcoms and scripted stuff that stuff's not being filmed either you're look you're talking talk shows and reruns so I think some of the only stuff out there right now is is this so I'm gonna be doing my best to bring you as many updates from our house as possible through this I've seen quite a few channels parlay what they do i watch a channel called the tim tracker talks about disney got turned on to them before we went on or make-a-wish trip to disney world their whole content is about going to disney all things Disney well that isn't happening so they're cooking food and showing what's happening at their house because that's what we have to do so maybe we'll come up with some entertaining stuff here at the house or maybe it'll be a little bit of footage of stuff from day to day and me having a one-on-one with you guys in front of the camera or maybe a maybe a two-on-one if I can get Casey to sit down with a couple of these okay thank you for sticking around we're here we're doing fine I hope you're doing fine it was it bad boys where he says what's up what's up take some time for yourself lastly this is an opportunity for us to work on ourselves this isn't this is an opportunity to focus on you focus on your kids to focus on improving yourself in some way you have this excuse now where you're not completely busy at work find a way to to improve whether it be just just reading that book you've always told yourself that you were gonna read or I see a lot of my old flare bartending competition friends that are saying okay well I guess I'll be learning some new tricks they'll be spending some time practicing so that when this is over I can come back and be that much better where it is we're resilient we've been through worse stuff before us as a people like we're gonna be we're gonna be okay we're gonna be completely changed by this but we are going to be okay just take a deep breath we're gonna do our best if we remember to be in this with each other and not against each other okay I gotta go I love you guys good luck see you the next one which is probably tomorrow or the next day I am I am currently learning a lot of new editing techniques today I learned how to reverse audio see if you can find that in this video bye guys
