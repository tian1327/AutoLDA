 getting out of this really tight spot it's super super tight but so been uh been a while since I've done want to these type of videos actually I'm heading to to work it is Saturday and I'm still going into the office because they called for all hands that were possible to get in there to go help admits this total coronavirus thing not for anything crazy right now but basically with the whole national emergency declaration yesterday for those watching this that was declared yesterday you know for the purpose of like you know getting access to funding and things like that but he also your trunk also removed a lot of restrictions on what you can call patient care area so that basically you can deal with more an influx of patients if you need to without having to be bound by their restrictions of Oh since this particular you know room didn't have its own like Kurt and it didn't have its own call belt button therefore you can't take care of patients in here you know removing those restrictions or some of those restrictions I don't know all the details of them but remove some of those restrictions so that you can you know deal with an influx of patients so we were asked to come in to go prepare our a ready room there's already room so we have a ready room I'm not a lot of the disaster preparedness committees already at the facility of my team decon our code orange training which is like mass casualty incident so I do it already room a lot and the right here was a place where we have access to like a bunch of stockpiled you know ventilators IV pumps things like that that if if the need emerges or if the need arises that you to break into the you know the ready room supply for instance a mass-casualty or you know influx of patients or things like that that they're there and available and you train down where they're at how to go get them team decon runs out of that room you got let's we have decontamination showers and decon this for like let's say there's a hazmat type incident and you need to go get people suited up and protected but they need to be able to you know decontaminate the the patients as they come into the facility so that's all run out of our already room which is pretty cool process by the way one of they help maybe I'll get some permission see if I can show you guys how it how it functions in there but basically long story short they want to turn the ready room they want to go through some of it I couldn't quite figure out from the the messaging if they're turning the righty room itself into an area ready to take patients which is technically was designed to be able to be converted into that but it's not that big is more for storage but they were also talking about making like a West pavilion and I don't know if they're gonna set up like an outside specialty care area like with through tents and stuff I'm not really sure but they basically said you know more hands make light work anybody who can come around nine o'clock tomorrow and come assist at the ready room and getting things moved around and and and prepared for this so I'm going in there to help out with this stuff I find a lot of this stuff like fascinating I've always found disaster preparedness you know fascinating and the fact that we're you know in a quote-unquote is a stir scenario though you know with the with this whole thing being Co vyd it's it's not as it's not as crazy as it could be it could have been much worse it could have been something that has a much higher mortality right so for what it is we're you know we're lucky where I don't think our response has been appropriate and now we're now we're finally getting to the point where the responses are becoming more appropriate which is good but a lot of you know we were lucky it wasn't something like you know way worse but I will say like you know I've been watching all these YouTube videos of people doing like the Costco runs and stockpiling and this and that a lot of that stuff is insane it's crazy I have not seen that around me and if you guys don't know I'm in Washington DC I mean my hospital is in downtown Washington DC the heart of DC I should say is not really in downtown DC but it's in the heart of DC I live in DC proper you would think out here it'd be a little bit crazy but it's actually it's not that bad I have not been to Costco in a few weeks though my wife went there actually for our last Costco trip and she went there two weeks ago so it was Toronto buyer stuff had already like happened and was already going on and it was it wasn't any crazier than normal she said it was you know pretty you know pretty much par for the course not sure if that's different now and in our state of national murders they have no idea I don't plan on going out there to find out because I don't want to but you know looking at the streets and everything looking at the things that I can see the places that I've gone is nothing off the wall at this point which is good people seem to be being relatively calm I have heard most of the stores up around a coil of paper and hand sanitizer of course but you know it's there's not mass hysteria it doesn't seem it seemed at least from what I can see granted we only have ten cases you got it we've we've doubled our cases in the last like week or so from like five two or I think it started at four you know we obviously started at one and went up but you know though it was holding steady at four and it went up to ten I have looked at the numbers this morning though so there's a very good possibility actually that the numbers are higher I have no idea I will look but it's nothing crazy on the news about it but anyway letting you guys know what I'm doing when I'm doing out here in the midst of this whole corona virus like outbreak going into work to see this I'm gonna see if I can get some footage in that ready room not really sure what I'll be able to get it's not a patient care area so I can probably get some footage in there without being like without having too much problem because there's not like patients and I'm worried about or anything but it's still you don't want to you know you can't be videotaping people without their their consent or recording people without their consent things like that so let's see what what we can do I'm going to show you some of the shelves or whatever we'll find out no guarantees but we'll see anyways guys I will season walking by the entrance right now there's already room you you those are hands before I swear why this will then just fall in the you you so here it is all put up air conditioning and everything doors like this ever sound setup yet but this is what its gonna be this is gonna be the waiting area before they get to the ready room where they're setting up some patient care areas another room back there that I was showing you right over in there and then yes so we'll see if I don't know if I can I set that up as a patient room yet I will I think they're doing that tomorrow so I'll get good pictures of it but why not we'll see later let's pretty fancy in here lights air conditioning duct work  all right let's get out of here so that was uh that was fun it was as you could see from some of the pictures I got some views inside the and inside the ready room no that doesn't mean anything to you yet because all we did was empty it out I think they're doing the patient stuff tomorrow they are turning that empty area in the back that had those pallets of I showed you afterwards is empty they're turning that into three different patient care areas I'm assuming for like a single patient in each of those three areas not like massive patient care areas but that tent that we set up that tent that we set up was for the waiting room essentially so if we have a lot of an influx of patients that's where they can go as an exterior waiting room and it was called on what I say it was the West pavilion and it turns out that it's called it's called that because that's the manufacturer of the tent is its most pavilion or West horizon or something like that but I was right when I said earlier it was West something I didn't quite know what that meant it's just that it was the tent manufacturer's name that's why they they call it that but emergency preparedness stuff I actually get really excited by I don't I hope that we don't have to utilize these items that were setting up for now and the fact that we're actually preparing hopefully means that you know it's always one of those things if you're prepared you're never gonna have to use it if you're not prepared or they're gonna have to use something it's kind of the the mantra of how that works I'm I don't know what it's happening right now we're literally in the middle of the parking lot and the MetroAccess van that's two cars up just stopped I'm not sure there it goes it's about to start going around everybody today to get out here I'm not sure what's happening oh is it the vehicle in front of them that stopped that's a little strange I have no idea what's going on right now we're Road either way so hopefully we don't have to utilize this stuff but the concept of emergency preparedness just really always has intrigued me always has fascinated me I always like to be prepared for these like that I guess it's kind of what I do is I do emergency preparedness anyway now when I do stuff at my job with downtime preparedness for the electronic health record or just in general being an emergency responder and this and that is kind of you know in our in our blood to to like to prepare for things like this but either way I really enjoy it and hopefully I can get some pictures of the patient care area when it's done we'll see there are beef actually out of this video if I can get them if not I'll have to wait until another day anyways guys thanks for watching and I'll keep you updated throughout the with all the things that are happening here in DC as we as we go throughout the next week or month or the next time frame as everything starts to progress and we realize what what we're really in for here so thanks for watching see you next time
