it's in it okay this is cute I don't got you pierce right now cuz I'm a see if I could just um ship it through UPS it'll be faster cuz I'm by the cemetery is the post office in town it's not gonna be open or I don't know if they're even open well I'm gonna go until UPS right now and go see if they'll let me if not I'm gonna go to Starbucks and um you know go on about what I need to do I only have a couple of things to do right now you know we have a couple more things I need to do and then I head back okay so they let me to ship it so they said that maybe Monday Oh get there I hope that it gets there soon because Missy's about to have that baby and I just want her cause it's a zero to three months that I at least cuz if she doesn't wear it if my sister stupid if she does the baby he's not able to fit it in or if it comes later she just doesn't wear it I at least want her to frame it so I'm gonna go to Starbucks right now and then I'm gonna call my boyfriend to see if you want something to eat go get that get gas and then all right Simon Starbucks drive-through right now I just got the both of wafer and he wants Wendy's but I really want a burger I think when I just get home I'll make potato tacos that's always the move that's always so good so yeah I think I'm just gonna make potato tacos I'm so I don't have my Starbucks drink and suppose I have a salad at huh I need to wash my figure gain weight or something tired of people telling me I'm not supposed to cuss have to wear that out yeah so much Starbucks gonna go to Wendy's and I think I'm gonna the car wash after we're gonna go to the car wash and then Wendy it's literally like right across the way I think I'll go to the car wash and then Wendy's so you'll see me at the car wash so everyone probably watch me in that last clip right there was like car wash what do you mean go wash your car they open like the car washes aren't open like what that's freaking suck so now I'm waiting this long line at Wendy's for a bacon eater and fries I don't know I guess that cuts one of my plans out I guess I'll just go get gas and then get some going home if I don't record in this last line this last but like if I record when I leave in the gas station hope you guys are having a good day hope you guys are having staines say if I just read on Twitter that Fresno's put their shelter in place until March 31st but you know not like if you guys listen because no one listens about going out everyone still going on and about me like I guess I don't know it can just be me too because like you well you didn't have to go out of town by any come in contact with the only time I went off and got went off was to go pick up the onesie and the shirt and then to the UPS Store and I stayed to the drive-through of Starbucks because obviously staying it do the drive-through windy wendy's because obviously and then gas I have my card on me so I'll just stay right there and pump my gas I want you to go in there and get anything else maybe this is something you guys should take like seriously because it's all just gets yeah things are gonna be reopening up and which i think is the stupidest idea ever like why are you gonna reopen it up some like stores because everyone has all this money like everyone has their like daddy Trump's track like unemployment and I you know I'm not gonna lie I'm one of those people I had no other choice but to be like hey day before my shift like hey you're not able to like you we don't have work for you like servers are out and so I didn't have no other no other choice then to get onto unemployment my job wasn't gonna be it wasn't gonna be like hey we're gonna take care of you they're like well you can file for unemployment and so that's what I had to do file for an employment and then like I qualify for the stimulus check but what people understand is with all this money that everyone's kidding like with all these little stores opening up it's just gonna make bigger wait times for everybody wanted to go spend that money I'm pretty sure everyone still has it if not then I hope you wasted it on groceries I know and I'm not one to talk about it because I read an article like like Trump or whoever like this day don't even care what people spend that money on because it's all going back to the hemming stupid but I think everyone without Aldi stores opening up all these places up and opening up I look cross-eyed it yeah but all these places is opening up be smart about what you're gonna do like be smart about going out wear a mask like I know a lot of stores are going to be letting has you're gonna have to wear a mask Costco now you have to our mask but wear a mask wear like a full bodysuit if you're gonna go out and risk going shopping because you're greedy enough and you don't want to stay home like Point Blank well everyone's gonna have their comments I comments about what I said but oh well that's just how I feel that's how I feel like everyone needs to stay home like and you don't understand either if all these people like I seen I'm not I seen someone on Facebook I don't know if they're from here like from right at ten I was but like I think I had they're from out of town I have him on my face but I don't really talk to them but they had like a whole quarantined freaking you know that whole quarantined parade for their kid or whoever and then I had a little party after like you're defeating the whole purpose of the quarantine birthday parade like why have a quarantine birthday pray to like what just to jump on the bandwagon and steam cool like oh yeah hon but come by after because we're still living it up like no Mother's Day I really know Mother's Day is gonna be just like Easter everyone's gonna go out everyone's gonna be having a little barbecues and whatever but no one really cares and no one's gonna care until where I'm from for the town I am in until one body drops someone dies and then everyone's can be scared and then everyone's to be like whoo I'm scared to go out like now how that same bleak motive that you want to go out all these places like no need like if your your helps brighten it going out to all these place it's like they couldn't even imagine I don't know if I can show but like I'm right across from below as this Lowe's is like so packed like why like why are you guys out like there's literally no need like I know everyone wants to work on their house and like do all this stuff there's one thing that I like about this quarantine is I take Niner on his walks now like at 6:37 and I get to enjoy that with him and it's crazy cuz now I see actual families like enjoying like going on bike rides like being in the middle of the grass area like how come you guys didn't do that before quarantine like I'm glad it's bringing everyone together but they have like here's my little rap I'm just ranting cuz I'm hot bothered and hungry but yeah I'm like the I'm in it literally not this car but the next car mine so unless you guys go if you haven't already go ahead and subscribe to me maybe hear more of my rants next Monday is gonna be my video of my second job of working at Dollar General for retail and like all my frickin craziness that went on there I'm sorry that the video that you guys seen or is gonna see this upcoming Monday next Monday which is like this upcoming Monday because it's right right now this aquarium on day like was all over the place but like I said before like in the about jns world is that I'm only able to upload 50 minutes because about 1516 minutes because I'm not monetized so all my stories have to get cut short and I'm like very into depth about stories so alright well love you guys
