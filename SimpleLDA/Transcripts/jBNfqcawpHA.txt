 good morning it's sunday and it is a really nice day out here in chicago it is not quite as warm as yesterday but it's still i i'm happy with it i am going for a walk but this time my destination is stan's donuts i have been contemplating it all morning i got last week's vlog out thought about the donuts just making sure i don't get hit i decided since it's a 15 minute walk to the donut place 15 minutes back if i don't take any detours then it's totally worth it i swear to two donuts i also made sure not to drink the rest of my coffee so get my donuts with it very planned out morning birds are chirping oh yeah i did put self-tanner on last night just makes me feel better about myself i've mentioned it before but i use the tan luxe drops because i can use my own moisturizer with them so i just put three or four drops in to my face moisturizer at night mix it all together and in the morning i'm damn it's pretty great although the rest of my body is not tan arms legs nothing just from here up because that's pretty much all that's showing all right i'm listening to a tim ferriss podcast on stoicism which is interesting and i'm going to keep listening to that and then cooking my donuts so i am it's monday by the way i am going to make a recipe from gabi's new cookbook and i am gonna make hold on the broccoli beef it doesn't look so good so i think i have all the right ingredients and i'm very excited about this so i will give it a shot and i'll let you know how it turns out i'm also very hungry right now so let's see how this goes hey there it's tuesday and i did not go on a morning walk it was raining and cold this time so i'm at the end of my work day and i am just working on some uh tik tok videos and my digital speaking coach website and things like that and uh my boyfriend's taking a nap i also put on self tanner last night where i didn't put it and it may have stopped raining but it's still cold so i'm not going outside today's cinco de mayo it's also taco tuesday so i think i'll be making tacos tonight uh they sound good to me they're super easy and i love using what's gabi cooking i know surprising but she has a line of spices and she has taco fajita senorita which i love but it's too spicy for my boyfriend so she loves oh god he loves he loves um the other one that's meant for meat but it has like cumin and has some other spices in there that i love throwing in for the taco meat that's my night and i don't know if i mentioned we watched waco have you seen waco it's about that cult in texas obviously waco texas uh very interesting i also didn't know how it ends because i i think i was a little bit too young to understand that at the time but how tragic jeez if you haven't watched waco it's dark but it's fascinating and i thought it was really good so take a look if you're interested and my dad told me i need to watch the ted bundy story so i'm a little nervous about that one but he said that that one's really good too so maybe i'll start watching that after i edit some videos here we shall see and fingers crossed a walk tomorrow morning is an option because i really do need to get outside like badly hey good morning it's wednesday and it's still winter in chicago the feels like is 30 something so but the sun is out and it's not raining so i can finally go for my walk it's been a few days ah feels good i am listening to the rise podcast with rachel hollis i've read one of her books uh but i do tend to like her podcast i've been listening to it a long time and this one's about when she spoke on oprah without not on the show but one of oprah's things i'm not that far yet so i think that'll be interesting because i too would like to speak with oprah be on our show um i don't know what i would talk about but it's goals so i yeah i'm gonna listen to that go for a walk i have a busy day ahead of me and just really happy the sun's out changes everything good morning it's thursday it's another brisk day in chicago not too cold but not too warmly there i have changed up my route for my walk very exciting part of the day and i think i have enough time to go see some of these like i follow it's at old chicago homes or doorways of chicago on instagram and they posted some places some homes that i think are kind of nearby so i'm going to try and look for those if i find them i'll record them for you and i also for the first time in what a week did a peloton workout did a 20 minute full body with robin no weights just body weight it was good and probably should do more of those but quarantine life the sun is so nice i'm also very happy it's thursday like very happy i'm listening to another rachel hollis podcast talk about the title oh you're not prepared for where you'll be in two years that's the title so sound interesting i don't want to go that way uh yeah her podcast is really good um motivational and i'm gonna keep walking so i walked a little further than planned i made it all the way to lincoln park the actual park it's about a 25 minute walk back home it's gonna it's all right it's gorgeous now all i want to do is walk through this park because it's so so pretty so and this is only the start of the park this part goes really far but we're actually the park is called lincoln park neighborhood lincoln park is a little bit further uh and there's some weird history about this park like this is a graveyard back i think chicago fire maybe before that um not the tv show like the great chicago fire i don't know it's interesting so i i just want to walk through it i'm gonna i gotta go i gotta walk back home it's time i'm running out of coffee too so i think this is the house i was looking for behind me it has two entrances now but back in the day it was built i should really get my facts straight before i start telling you random chicago history that i've looked at but i believe i'm gonna squeeze between these cars that that house was built for a husband and wife i need to find out more details also i don't know when this turned into a history of chicago tour this is just random research that i do but i clearly forget part of it um i love seeing these old buildings these old houses and kind of looking and seeing what you know what were they before and you know what are they now i just i find it fascinating so next time i'll try and get more details for you okay so this house you're not on a tour you just thought you turned it tuned into a vlog so this is a really really old house this looks like um it's where tau is now used to be a club called excalibur used to be a chicago history museum i think anyways it looks very similar i don't know if it's the same but it has a coach house next to it and these are chicago coach houses there's a lot of them in the lincoln park neighborhood a friend of mine used to live in one and i okay when i say a lot like i think based off of any other city uh there's quite a few it's called i think a chicago coach house so pretty cool a lot of them are um people like rent them out they make them their own home like separate from their home so yeah because this one has its own address so kind of cool i'll show you a little bit more of it another dead bird i don't know what's going on that every week i see at least one dead bird when normally i don't see any kind of homeless that turns out my three-year-old niece has also seen a ton of dead birds it's a hot topic when we chat uh she told me she wants to come to chicago and see my denver's she lives in vegas uh too cute i was like i don't think you're gonna be there when when you come to chicago but i'm sure we'll find something okay i'm finally done with my walk that was a really long walk and i need to hurry up and get ready for work so i'm gonna go now so it's been a day or two also i just got back from a run so i am my face is still really red i have it's been quite the quarantine week um yeah so i just got back from a run it takes me a long time for my face to calm down like i took a shower it wasn't really hot but it takes a while for the redness to calm down which is why i never go for a run before work because it takes an hour so and by that time like i'm putting makeup on top of red face and just doesn't work for me and that's my excuse for not running during the week oh i wanted to show you what i'm wearing right now these are blue and gray sweats or soft blend i think they're called sweats i'm telling you these are the perfect loungewear i wish i had these the beginning of quarantine and i want them in every color so they're from loft and they're by blue and gray which if you know me i typically don't that's not a store that i typically shop but let me show you these so these are the sweat pants they're a narrow leg but they're not tight they're so soft and then this sweatshirt is so cozy the pants have a little pocket there and i just am loving the look i got this in navy obviously and the pants aren't as small i had to cuff them a little bit at the bottom i'm five two and the top is a medium so i'd say true ish to size i'm a size six on the bottom and yeah these are just really great i went on the site to send my mom a link to these because i think that she will love them too because i feel like it's hard like i wear leggings during the week and they leave lines on my legs and i have tons of leggings but sometimes i just want it to be like a looser fit and these are the perfect lounge bear i'm gonna stop talking about them but i'll put link a link in the links in the description box below so if you want to check those out you could i think right now it says if you buy four items you get 60 off which means it's cheaper than what i paid i paid 34.95 for each piece there's other colors black is one of them pink is one of them and there's dresses and stuff so i don't know i may be purchasing more i'm stop talking all right i oh i'm going to show you what i baked today it's been a busy day let me show you so i baked these cupcakes if my mom's watching this then she knows i'm bringing them over to her i'm gonna frost them tomorrow aren't these so cute i got these from home goods i think they're so cute so i made that up with the recipe to the cupcakes below and then i made this blueberry streusel cake which is supposed to be in a skillet but i don't have a lake or say skillet it's what's gotta be cooking this is so good i haven't eaten real food today just uh just my coffee cake type thing and some icing so i'm gonna eat some real food or make a smoothie and then i'm start editing this vlog so i can get this out to you for tomorrow morning all right uh have an awesome day night week whenever you're watching this and i will see you next week bye
