 hello st. Patrick's Day March 17 2020 I don't know how to blog I did I've done it before but I don't know how but I want to start because I enjoy watching blogs and my favorite kind of blog was are of people doing their everyday things around their house which is bizarre to even say out loud but it's true and no one in my family or none of my friends I think really understand that but it's um it's it's a thing that I like and I should not be embarrassed by it um if you can hear my voice I'm a little bit under the weather not the best time to be under the weather I have strep throat or I had strep throat went on a course of antibiotics for ten days and I believe now I have some kind of either allergy as I'm sneezing my coughing stopped sort of I'm still coughing a little bit from I think the remnants of the strep throat but not really any more so from the research that I've done sneezing is not a symptom of that illness that we're all dealing with right now so I'm just trying to even though I don't think that's what it is trying to stay inside whether this will be a daily blog or a weekly vlog or something well it's a 8:45 in the morning I dropped my husband off at the Train he's still going into work every day they've just closed the restaurants and bars indefinitely schools are all closed right now I'm just finishing up a cup of decaf coffee and yeah I don't know let's just let's see how this goes  I'm watching YouTube I just finished a breakfast put in a load of laundry a my breakfast if you know me and you've been watching the yoga channel for a while maybe like oh I thought you were vegan I was a vegan for four years I've been a non vegan for one year it's for health reasons I just recently also started gluten-free and dairy-free again so I had a dairy back for a year I'm trying dairy-free or at least very limited for health reasons and I may disclose why you know future video I'm just not ready to do that at this moment in time so yes I'm eating meat I'm eating eggs I'm not happy about it but I am happy about it because I'm not happy about it because of moral reasons obviously I was vegan for the animals I am happy about it because it's more convenient I am happy about it because they feel like I can eat I'm trying to proactively do something for my health disagree or agree this is how I'm living my life at this moment and will probably be a vegan again in the future but that won't be for a while at this point because I have some life goals I'd like to accomplish and I'm being super cryptic right now these life goals kind of coincide with my health I need my health to be a certain way in order to achieve these goals anyway done speaking in riddles  so it's a lot later now my husband just got home he's in the shower we were going to have two of his friends over cuz it's st. Patrick's Day we were gonna have them over because they're actually visiting from Ireland so they don't really have anywhere to go since all the bars and restaurants are closed they're just sitting in their hotel room but they're been afraid to leave the hotel room so they're not coming anymore I'm probably just gonna cook dinner don't know if I'm gonna be doing anything else interesting this evening but I'll keep you posted  good morning it's the next day I just says it'ld yesterday dropped off my husband at the Train he's still going to work however we heard news this morning that the mayor may order a shelter in place for the city so I'm not really sure what that means but um I mean most of me it means that we have to take shelter in our homes which probably means he won't be able to go to work all I can do I guess all I know one can do is stay positive yeah I'm just gonna try to work from here today as I usually do yesterday I did a load of towels today and I think I need to wash the rest of the clothes but I'm not sure if I should wait until my husband comes home so I can get his clothes I know this is a very interesting story um do you know it doesn't sound like it but I am feeling better I'm hoping that whatever I have is going away I have definitely been staying home after I drop my husband off I don't really go out I have to go out to do the laundry so when I go it's just in the basement of my apartment building so I have to exit the building I'll go into another entrance so basically what I'm doing when I'm there there's usually no one in there watch my hands before I go sanitize the doorknob of my apartment wash my hands when I get back that's all I can do really I have to do my laundry everyone's just doing the best they can probably shouldn't be touching my tie right now I saw a mean that said I think I learned about Cove at 19 and it was like bacteria can spread through this at frequent hand-washing is the best way to prevent the virus and then the last one was my I love touching my face which I thought was funny because it's true you don't notice how much you touch your face until you're told you can't touch your face I thought that was funny talking to a camera is a lot less satisfying than talking to a human I just thought this was funny so I went to go get my ear pods and I remember that I hadn't disinfected them at all and I've been putting them on right here so just stupid so I was like what can I use and I have this packet of Clorox wipes this travel pack that I have been rationing because there's none left at the store so I was like should I use one there's only there was only nine in the pack I've used like maybe I don't know five or something so I'm over since I've had it so I'm rationing these um there there it is the one that I just used to sanitize or disinfect or whatever my earplugs  I will tell you again this very painful facts about the situation our city right now confirm cases as of the last count this morning already twelve thousand three hundred thirty nine New Yorkers have tested positive for Kovan 19 I want people understand that at this point we're about sixty percent of the cases in New York State are here in our city about thirty five percent of the cases in the entire country are here in this city we are the epicenter of this crisis no one wants that distinction not a single one of us but it is true that we are the epicenter of this crisis and that's why we so desperately need help particularly from our federal government to get through it as I said this as of this moment ninety nine confirmed deaths related to coronavirus we know more are coming and that again those are not statistics those are human being those are friends those are loved ones the breakout by borough Queens has 3621 cases Brooklyn 3494 Manhattan two thousand five hundred seventy two the Bronx 1829 and Staten Island 817 is a very tough time but it is not a time for people to give up to say the least because this fight is just begun it is not a time for a hopelessness because we finally see things starting to happen and first and foremost New Yorkers are making things happen we're going to fight every day to stay ahead of this curve we're gonna literally be in a race against time want to make clear as we all get into this new reality we all have been told I think very very clearly to think about the difference between what's essential and what's not essential at this point since we passed 8:00 p.m. last night non-essential businesses non-essential activities are a part of the past and that's going to be true for weeks to come so non-essential businesses closed down the things we all used to think we're normal the things we used to do for leisure and fund the things we used to spend time and money on we're not doing that anymore honestly we're doing something different now so essential businesses are what are allowed to be open grocery stores pharmacies food establishments that provide delivery and take-out obviously the kinds of businesses that we're going to depend on to get through this and another thing we have to recognize will be different we're used to where New Yorkers were used to crowds we're used to lines we're used to being close together not anymore we're not going to allow crowds to form we're not gonna allow lines where people are tightly packed next to each other we're not going to allowed any indoor space to get overcrowded we're not going out outdoor spaces to get overcrowded from this point on everyone needs to understand social distancing six feet apart on every side the obvious exception is when you're with the people who live under the same roof with you the family and whatever the composition of your family those you live with obviously that's different because you're in close proximity all the time and if you live with someone else and you're out on the street just the same way as you would be living together close together that's fine we understand that but for people who you do not live under the same roof with you're gonna have to practice the social distancing and we're going to help the city of New York all agencies will be there to educate people to remind people to warn people sometimes to step in and help people create more separation we're going to be doing that very very energetically from this point on and we've made clear that you everyone we understand who has to go out for groceries or for medicines or for a little bit of exercise or walk the dog that's okay but for as little time as possible and there are some people who should not go out and those are the folks who are the most vulnerable the folks who really have to avoid any other contact with other people and that means especially outside their family obviously and that means folks over 70 and folks with those serious pre-existing conditions medical conditions and also I want to say to my fellow New Yorkers this week's gonna be decisive we want to see how this is going we're going to work with the state of New York to figure out what the law the rules I should say will be for the longer term this week is our chance to test different approaches we need to make sure people will practice social distancing in our parks and playgrounds and if we don't think it can be done we're gonna have to come up with tougher rules so it really is incumbent upon all New Yorkers to do your damnedest to live by this new reality as our officers go around monitoring and enforcing the more we see people practicing social distancing the more we see people avoiding crowds and really creating some space the more we can allow folks the opportunity to use parks and playgrounds fully if we see that we're just not seeing enough evidence that people getting the message we're gonna be tougher about getting that message out and more enforcement if that's still not working we could easily get to the point soon where we say you know what we're not gonna be allowed able to allow playgrounds to be open I don't want to do that I don't think a lot of New Yorkers want to see that happen but the only way we keep playgrounds open is if people really honor the rules don't overcrowd them we don't need family groups mixing with each other we don't need kids playing with kids outside their families I know it's strange I know it's difficult I really do but this is reality we have to make sense of so if everyone is tough and strong as New Yorkers are we can find a way to strike that balance we know that's gonna be tough as the weather gets warmer but again that's just for the duration of this immediate crisis and then when we get through it we can go back to normal
