so you never miss when I post a shiny video now the gang is all here let's get straight into it so I'm really excited about today because I'm finally going shopping for something that I have been wanting to do for the longest time especially since I've moved back home I have transformed my room from middle school me to adult me it was really important to me to do for the new year especially because I am a blogger and I need a room to vlog in all the time if I'm gonna be vlogging at home and I don't like to do it in my kitchen or you know in any other room but my own like my room is my own room but it doesn't feel like me because it was this ugly blue that I loved at the time when I was younger my carpet needed to be done um my furniture was really old there wasn't a specific theme in my room so I just pulled up to home goods and I really want a big huge mirror in my room so I can take my selfies because that was another thing that I didn't have in my room was a huge mirror to take pictures in and I love taking pictures of myself so really everything that I mean I'm about to get today and I'm about to head inside and you guys are gonna come with me along this entire journey to remodel my room from middle school Chanel to adult Shetty  all right so I came across this cute organizer that I can put like my flat iron my curling iron in still put my lotions and stuff here and I draw it something anything them I know I want to put two pictures on my shelves and then I came across this and this rug that I want to put it under my mirror but then I also see these now from my makeup so oh my gosh HomeGoods is dangerous get this I need stuff I need stuff to put on my dresser and I also want a cute garbage this is cute  Wow no this is mine I just need to figure out how it's gonna fit in my car or how we're gonna deliver it to my house but this is it maybe I'll use this garbage can because there's all the colors of my room yeah I'm gonna get this one okay I'm all over the place ended up finding this makeup organizer and stage I think this is much better than getting a huge one because I don't have a ton of makeup and then like I said I'm bringing this scar Patrol I love this and it has all the colors of my room I'm so excited let's go find out about this mirror and buy this stuff for my room  because the mirror was way too beautiful to let it sit there for another day at another minute another hour and give somebody else opportunity to own that mirror because that mirror is for me so I tried getting it in the car with the help of the workers at HomeGoods and we cannot get it like we tried every angle every way it could not work I was about to go back inside and return it but they were like oh no you don't have to return it so I'm running into Home Depot right now to rent a truck for an hour go back to home goods put the mirror in the car go home drop the mirror off come back to Home Depot drop the truck off and so I gotta make my way to work call my job until then I'm gonna be 30 minutes late so I'm going in a different time all for this mirror this mirror spots have I'm about to take the best selfies in this mirror like it is for me I needed it so here I am guys are going to Home Depot right now cuz we bout to get this mirror ok go hard for the things that you want that's my TED talk for the day okay so would you believe that I did not even have to go to work today my manager was like listen Chanel I know you're still stuck at Home Depot so you don't have to come to work and I'm like great so you know what that means I want to do more shopping so I just left Walmart and I got this cute chair it's black and I'm gonna put my pink throw blanket over it I got some black shelves that I'll put my picture frames on and whatever else I feel like putting on there came with three of them and then I got my blackout curtains because I hate sunlight when I'm trying to sleep so like I said tomorrow my bed set will be here and they'll be setting that up for me and and along with my bed set they're gonna set up my rods for my window curtains to be up and before you know it I will be moved back into my room and I cannot wait but I'm really excited to show everything oh so I'm finally on my way home the last big thing that I need is a TV but I'll grab that tomorrow morning along with like the amount that I'll need to put on the wall because I don't want my TV on my wall and yeah that's that's pretty much gonna wrap up everything from my room so I'm really excited to see how it turns out and to definitely show you guys what it looks like after this Mira has made it home I absolutely love her she is the best part of this room and I don't even have my furniture yet obviously that'll be here tomorrow morning I got my curtains up putting up tomorrow got my new chair which I absolutely love it's so comfortable and I just have this pillow that will lay on that oh my gosh I'm so in love with this mirror like the second I seen it I knew it was for me because this is exactly what I wanted and this is better than what I even wanted for myself for this room it was even more exciting is this chair like you don't understand how comfortable this chair is and it was only $35 at Walmart um can watch TV that's another thing I never really watched TV much I'm gonna get a TV that has like all the different apps in it like Netflix YouTube cuz I mostly watched YouTube and Netflix barely but I also pay for a Disney Plus because I'm a natural Raven the proud family Lizzie McGuire type of a girl so now I have the opportunity to watch that on my big screen I'm so excited so today was a really good day it was a long day but it was so worth it and I got and you know what my favorite purchase up today was live here I'll see you guys tomorrow good night all right guys good morning into 7:45 and my furniture is here at this point I have completely spoiled myself I'm about to turn my whole room into a hotel room honestly now while I understand that traveling in New York City right now is not the safest thing for anyone I also cannot pass up the opportunity of spending time in New York because this is a very very rare occasion that me Michael any only are in New York at the same time so as you can see I have two scarves wrapped around my mouth I rode the train like this I'm about to walk through the city like this to meet up with them and I will be with them shortly and I am so excited  guess who I have 5 million that ugly yeah   my fried chicken sandwich presents ballots / alright guys the moment that you've been waiting for and especially me we are now looking at my brand new remodeled room that I am absolutely obsessed with especially my headboard which lights up I didn't even know I had ordered it like this so that's when it's off and it has four different three different lights that you can do so when it gets dark out or not even dark out but when the Sun starts to go down I just like to turn it on I put my mirror over here which you all know I am absolutely obsessed with and it goes perfect like meh suppers goes perfect with my furniture because it's also mirrored down here which is really good my dresser is really big I definitely underestimated how big this furniture was last thing is just putting up um my TV on this wall so for now it is here until we get somebody over here to mount it I have junk over there because my house was not junk but it's the merch orders that I'm about to put together I love how everything is color seamed and goes perfect with the idea that I had in mind this is what my room looks like when the light is off which is so so nice because then I just have that on while I'm watching TV my TV has pretty much everything you know I love watching YouTube so I have all of those options this movie we're about to watch called God's compass which is my mom's recommendation for our movie night so you know other than that I pretty much did whatever I want on my TV I'm really excited because I've never had a smart TV because I never watched TV but now that I have it I can't stop watching TV I've got my favorite shows my favorite movies I'm telling everybody to watch so you know I absolutely love my room and I'm so happy that you guys were able to see how it looked before this and how it looks now and I'm absolutely obsessed with it this tapestry was huge so this was the only idea I had for it because I don't have any wall space to put it in it would have went perfect behind my TV if I wasn't putting it on the if I wasn't getting the TV mounted so this is my room and I absolutely love love love love love it so right now I got to get these merch orders together and have them sent out in the morning and then we're about to start movie night so for those of you that keep up with me on Instagram and especially watch my stories you do know that we have two winners for the Valentine's Day crew neck giveaway Naomi and
