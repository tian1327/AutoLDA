 extreme measures immediately we're all  brilliant isn't it 25,000 cases of confirmed Ivan wanted to do this video for a while as someone who experienced SARS quarantine now coving 19 in New York I cannot believe the stupidity of events that happen since January I was hoping this video could help those who were never in the loop I wonder how we got to where we are so quickly and also those English speaker who never read up on the other side of the story by filling in the blanks for them a couple of disclaimer this video is done on the 16th of March which is almost three weeks ago things have developed a number have changed what I thought was gonna happen already happened and that caused me to stop procrastinating and do this video the second thing is this is a vlog channel with a theme of traveling so mostly I'm trying to record my thoughts at the spot time so this video is not meant to give you an accurate timeline of how things happened if you want the most accurate timeline go check out this channel according to him China reported a rare disease to waho in December it was so mid-january to confirm that inter person transmission was possible in January I was on which had and we chatted some great to offer everything basically there were articles talking about this fire at the Chinese New Year China was walking down it was asking everybody to contain themselves and I was like oh okay this is serious you know at that time that's when we started to hear the theories about if it's coming from that if it's a gonna be similar to stars but it goes away in summer you know that's probably everybody's hopes are this article's pop song feeling but we defeated SARS and this is no more serious and pensara so it's gonna be fine but then their articles coming up and saying human never defeated SARS it went away by itself we don't know how it went away we never produced a vaccine but it just got away because it doesn't like hot weather friends came over and she graduated from the most prestigious school in Wuhan and she told me that she was on this alumni circle and they were raising money to send masks to China cuz they were out and they were able to raise they started in another day and Friday evening and they raised over a million dollars until Sunday in February I started to get to wear masks the kind of media which is making it sound like you're stupid person to even believe I'm sorry contacts with work in one on one hand they're like don't buy any baskets and it's not going to work on the other hand I like to save the mass work for the person who deal with sick people because it works for the really isn't it there was nobody wearing masks right but when I go back to my building was has a lot more Asian or just say Chinese we were masks and I think my both my roommates are wearing masks at least by the end of February I think the first comment I got was from a homeless guy I said go to the hospital that's not how to help nobody that's the first guy who coming out of this soon after I think someone who I see more regularly but like you know he doesn't work right and I did not even bother to argue I just like no he does people were talking when they're near me and they were saying well I don't think my eyes is gonna work me yeah I don't think I'm wearing the same yeah mathis know was a surgical my house is not built for this purpose they were talking to each other but I know that they talking like right like right next to me they said it to me kinda they were also talking about this its massive we're gonna be helpful because it's only surgical mess it's not built for that purpose but it's a real mess to prevents liquid and you all will also prevent to you for a touch of your face so you know you cannot get a 95 surgical mess is works just fine if you're just going to everyday transit it will protect you 80% of the time if you just pushed back about beating people about me we're messy no mo rebuilt and I'm like you asked me to say well let's see how what I do the second thing is I'm sure there are people who actually want to wear masks but they're like feeling this pressure because nobody is wearing masks so that's exactly I'm doing if I'm gonna be the first one to do it but if that's gonna make you feel more comfortable then someone's gonna start doing this so that's what I did February what they were talking about this Cruise Line really serves as a hotbed for this bar it's to pre like within that ship and you're just dumping those people you just want them to die to release them it's like oh you're sending a lot of artists and during this time you so you want to get on a course on your pretty thing probably doing a week of it six the the Chester man was diagnosed with what's has said positive and probably gonna have a week before there was the first positive case it came back from Israel and right often time we're like okay we're cuz this person he goes through Grand Central every day you know how many people go through Grand Central I have been in places like Tokyo I've been in places like Beijing there's no other city I sold dance I walk on the street of New York II almost be seen on  sky because all the buildings are just they're just like third final digit uh I was living on a 50 for like 50-something four billion got like 60 levels however the never print on a residential building this high to many people here and people don't care enough I'm telling you the public transit in Japan they do wear masks and we are not taking it seriously here they're just going around and they cleaning the subway in Asia they're so freakin clean not like here it's just a signature smell of New York you know what it is P like P that like probably was from like I don't know like three months ago usually after the confirmed pesos no  way am i removing a master I think wearing a magnetic 18 hours a day number are I think over that weekend in America if I'm like just him and a six people around them to like 40 right while we know by this point at least he infected like like 100 in register their wear gloves but they still don't wear masks these guys must be alien you know they breathe through their hands please educate me how the very end cause it's gonna protect you from missing iris don't you go back home and you wash your hands probably wear one pair of glasses a isn't that right so if you're just thinking because you wear this one way to tie something dirty so you won't use it to touch your hair because you got running all of sudden like another hazard school we're all because like you're gonna have tight and we're gonna go out so you just your body alternative Google and other things to touch your hair they don't want you to believe I'm asking this gonna work so their attention to go hands it's the so hope we can work I'm gonna be like in February when things got severe I was like there's no way the New York government is gonna do anything yes it's gonna happen because of this capitalism capitalism you cannot take extreme measures but the government cannot walk inside the Citadel because probably you need to consider they might get sued and there are some jobs and they were going to complain so I do not think that was going to happen but her after but just there was a lockdown I was like okay it is going to happen because I'm contrary to my believes when all those things you know the structure is the political correctness and worry about you know these kind of backlashes only happens when there is no emergency when there is emergency when your country is on a verge of you know collapsing when there is a major disaster happening all those votes to like all those are just bubbles that don't mean anything the city realized that they it is severe they have the power to shut down an entire town and that's what they will do changing one guidance a day which is crazy and they weren't shutting the school next all the restaurants are shut for anything about delivery which is basically like they're just copying China from two months ago people complain about I'm like what the are you even completing I do me this time and say you still want to go on and eat your praising the 17th which is a week from today they finally decided that we're all gonna work what to say the government said that we're gonna you need to redo 70% of word-for-word service I can't we definitely just have evolved so that last thing that I would say is yesterday we have a confirmed positive but I think everybody's been in office long enough so it was probably so this pretty much should happen with corporates here I think they definitely do not want anybody home but they also do not want any responsibility for autistic so the firm's is still giving you an apartment or paperwork to say you know to say that if necessary and you have to go to office you're presenting a shot in place but then we'll start discussing we'll see a lot of cars on the street right now I don't think these are off with deliveries I'm sure they are just hanging around in their car trainer gloves yeah and that's what happened this week when New York kind of get hit this number I get it started to take because this is where people make the market so that affects like the entire world and what things happens in the US any kind of mirror on it and they won't believe China will happen the same which is why you know China is recovering very well right now but the stock is show all indexes are sure going down because they they still under disbelieve night whatever the you have something about somebody in New York entire financial market is going to crash so they still have a marauder China oh it's just the inefficiency of this market and everything to the firm and every time I walk past the TV it's always talking microRNA virus China equal to Coronel virus it's what the media depict sit and New York Times even said well you know there are people calling it on reddit it's making it racist like you probably the first of all Kolkata quad bars right I don't even know if it's February January but they lock down the water saying that 14 days if it benches I really can't go ahead what's your problem just taking extreme measures immediately so that's what he says is why there wasn't a lot of people when came from China then got here because you can't write you can look I know the orcs have got a lot of  on from Dom's aside too but like I just they definitely don't pro-china visit what they said the cases from from New York the cases in United States are getting like larger more severe and the majority coming from from people which I was abroad for example China and then right after they said that there was a charge it listed to top countries where people travel to to contract the virus China wasn't even know top ten I was like Italy Iran Israel I know those cases UK it wasn't China wasn't even Egypt China wasn't even on the top the contracted the case is it with the practical cases in the ICC majority coming home taya it was written right about that table okay it was just well also funny when you want to on combination on it all that you can't even though you're slapping yourself is like stopping yourself in a face and just one freaking page what happened in China right probably like because there no time was no no New Year the factory needed to be going back to work because they need to produce this much for supplies which is what they did and then the entire time is recovering its industry right now because the world needs these mass and manage hurt by China and China was the only one who's manufacturing all those bringing things at that point they said they probably got like a few million mask grew to Italy and these super spreader is right I only know three cases one in New York and my sister went in a eight delete and people were just like oh these people are crazy there was sick and he went to marathon and they effects a that person effects are like hundred people and got one in Korea also does the same thing she's infected thousand people um at this point right and because it kind of contracts it I don't think like no people have but thank the first 100 people sheet number thirteen me she doesn't protracted a Hydra people by going to this religious gathering a basically occult in Korea and that's what they're doing and these call this call is just so freakin insane after they feel like they were being discriminated they started to send their their people to other churches gathering so that they can everybody else out to it so that the country would not blame them even in the you guys they realize that effort and how that fish and Chinese government's are like you really need to be only watch Fox News for you to not realize the advantage of having such a government government you need to to take your temperature every day and you need to report to every place you've been and you need to be strictly under control you need to wear masks you have a place your enter you need to scan a code and you only leave your apartment if you're it's a permission to so like you cannot impact 100 people and if you lie about something like she oughta bring card from the US and she or entire family just fool to China and she just see the government pretty much they said that she didn't take the fever appeal and she said that she wasn't having a fever they gonna find out about that where the case is she lied on this I first was like oh no these people don't want to test so like I'm going back to my motherland so they can test me but she lied about it and so the hospital say you know we can't cover your cost its point there's no community spread within China but only people who are like imported they were having a virus and they were infecting the local people from China though what they want is that nobody from a profit goes back home but it's not really fair so the government is a long ago about home but they prepare your hotel to prepare your food and they allow you to go home but you need to be isolated for like 14 days right I love you and we're Thursday if I can get to eat that in Boston for breakfast every day I would be so happy that I can die United is a is probably becoming the third highest country with a positive number and that's history will sleep it speaking if you're talking about the current number I mean it's probably a second place because China is pretty much out of it like I was talking to people and in a firm is like it's pretty serious it and they were like lobbies and there's just like a cold I was like what the and only the old people and other people would die so they were like mom I'm not old enough for that no it's like people still don't take it seriously right thank you very much for staying till the end of this video to show my appreciation I would like to discuss my deeper thoughts about this pandemic any other YouTube videos try to discuss why Western world is getting hit a lot harder than Asia will attribute this to culture what they're saying is Asia is a lot more emphasized on conformity well Western world is more about independent like I mentioned in the beginning of this video this channel is actually about my round-the-world trip it happened last year and I've been procrastinating and not how did any of those videos one of the most important things I learned from around the world trip is that we're more similar than we're different another thing that I learned from my trip is that media has enormous thoughts on people and that has been demonstrated in this pandemic well the Western media a contempt attitude to what Chinese policy of requiring everybody to wear masks most locals I've seen decided that thinks in the US will be a lot better and that US has an advantage over China well granted that there are also a minority of people who believes that the system itself allows China to react more quickly and efficiently in a pandemic like this because China by China a third world country with tons of pollution autocratic governments every constituency just want independence and hate their governments everybody is suffering at eight dogs of course things are going to be completely different here in the u.s. essentially the only effective measures so far is a lockdown and China has been doing that for two months the Western world has been extremely cautious and slow in implementing these effective measures after they wrote so much shared about Chinese violated human rights with these lockdowns so even after they decided to do the lockdown they still have to make a new name and the claim that they were following Korea in Japan instead of the most original implementer China nationwide lockdown is going to be taken seriously by both Japan and Korea that is a result of proximity which allow regular tourism and of Jobson media like from Japan and education systems that include Chinese like South Korea in many other countries facing 90 and many of those cities has resumed order a few weeks ago who has unlocked for a couple of days at which I can see my friends just going out without masks and this particular France and she was sitting in my favorite lime skewer restaurants that I have not been for the past couple years New York has really just only been locked down for a couple of weeks I'm just hoping that a media can focus less about how much money the government is giving and how the market is doing and the government's in stop doing your interviews and how many shows but just actually spend the time to figure out a way to deal with this and I hope that you can find useful things to do at home and not being stagnant and this is all over you can be a better self
