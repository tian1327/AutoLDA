 good morning friends welcome or welcome back to my channel if you are new my name is amy and i am a flight attendant today we are back in the air guys this is day one of a four-day trip today is super easy it's just a deadhead from salt lake city to san antonio and then i am done for the day for those of you who don't know what a deadhead is i am still considered a working flight attendant however i am sitting as a passenger on this flight so i'm not actually the one working it hence the real people close instead of the uniform so yeah it's just gonna be a super easy day the weather here is really really crummy so i'm hoping that we have good weather in san antonio because this hotel is really awesome it's right on the riverwalk so it would be kind of neat to be able to take you guys to the riverwalk and it's walking distance from the alamo so let's get going  down  i was actually really surprised with how many people were at the airport today but a bunch of places are reopening today so it makes sense it had to happen sometime it's about 1 53 p.m so i figured i would go explore walk around the riverwalk and maybe stop by the alamo i know you can't go inside still but it might be neat just to go check it out since this will be one of the few times when i can walk around and no one will be there so that's actually the riverwalk there's some construction going on but that's what i mean that's how close we are quick little room tour for you guys already put my stuff here here's the light pretty standard bathroom bathtub shower little coffee thing here very exciting so i can make my oatmeal in the morning closet i'm gonna hang up my uniform in just a second tv and the best part two beds we love it one for eat one for sleep and there are three windows and a little desk oh my lord who set it to 75. all right i'm going to eat some lunch i'm going to try my best not to take a nap but you know it happens i didn't sleep super well last night but it is such a beautiful day it's about 88 degrees here in san antonio it's sunny and i am here for it because it was disgusting when we left salt lake today it was raining it was just gross so yeah i'm excited to just walk around and enjoy the sunshine  i am sweaty and disgusting and i need a shower i don't know if you could tell from the video but a lot of restaurants on the riverwalk have opened up i think today may 1st is the first day that they were allowed to start reopening things i saw not a ton of people but a decent amount that we're out to eat did walk by my favorite restaurant here which is casa rio that was the restaurant with all of the really cute colorful umbrellas and they were still closed i wasn't going to eat there today just because i did pack my food for this trip i didn't really feel like spending the money but they are still closed so hopefully the next time that i come which is in two days they will be open the alamo was still closed i think you can see in the video there was a sign that just said like please stay back behind the chains and they did have two officers that were standing there to make sure people were following the rules san antonio is one of my favorite favorite layovers the food here is so good and it's always really neat to be walking distance away from things like the alamo like that's something that i learned about in history class in school but before this job i would have probably never come here just because i really had no reason to to be honest before i started this job i really never thought about san antonio and now it's my favorite layover so that is the beauty of traveling i always get very excited when i see this layover on my schedule and conveniently on this very trip i have the same layover twice all right well i'm gonna go take a shower and i will catch up with you guys  tomorrow  for the okay oh the blog what's the vlog like a video blog of what for my youtube channel youtube channel yeah my face was like what is it you want to be featured in it no i really don't no i don't i was joking nope too bad hi all right so we made it to minneapolis it was a very bumpy flight i had someone in first class with our hands up because it kind of felt like a roller coaster i guess so that was pretty wild we've got two flights left today one to williston north dakota and then straight back yeah and then we're done the minneapolis-st paul airport is pretty much a ghost town right now things may be opening up but the airport is still pretty dead  thank you  you
