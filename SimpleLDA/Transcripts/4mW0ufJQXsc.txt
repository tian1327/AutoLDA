 this is rush hour by the way   the trains are running fine but there's just no one taking them hey baddies I'm the bad enabler and I'm here with well I'm here but this is a very strange time but what you just saw was some of the trains some of the trains from rush hour recently I went to visit someone and that was probably one of that I guess was one of the last train rides that I'll be on in a very long time or in a while because we're gonna mock down I'm in New York City hopefully everyone out there is safe lockdown this basically you're not allowed outside unless I'm not like not allowed but you can go out for exercise you can go out for groceries you can go out for doctors things like that but otherwise they want you away from everyone so that this virus and the pandemic abates and goes away so that everyone out there is being safe and careful and still retaining their sanity but speaking of this is meant to kind of entertain kind of inform kind of just say hello and one of the things to entertain inform is lip care just because so a couple of people do ask me wait why are you still focused on like these things when we're stuck inside you can't do anything anyway well one of the reasons why is because when this is all over you don't want to and you know we'll be over and this will pass there we will be okay and one of the things is you don't want it to end and go outside and you know have someone be like you know did you just crawl out of a sarcophagus what's going on with you like you look like a mummy no you don't have to be the case so I was running out of my favorite lip sleeping mask from Kiehl's I love it I've had it for probably about a year I bought it at a friends and family kind of discount thing 20% off it was normally around 24 26 dollars so if your mats cheaper but I'm all done there's like nothing left there's almost nothing left in it this was the Kiehl's sleep butter minute butter mask Phillips overnight lip treatment it was 0.25 ounces I believe yeah point 35 ounces and I use it every single night and in the morning you just feel hydrated it would feel like it's like sunken to your lips it was just amazing but very little left almost nothing left just was around the edges there now when I realized this heels was already closed but Sephora was still open until five o'clock so I got there at about four o'clock 4:15 and I was able to get a lip care treatment but not this one because they do not carry the butter mask Phillips spiked heels at Sephora so I asked them where the good ones and I knew which one I had in my mind the one I had in my mind was tatcha ta tcha it was a lip sleeping mask thing it was about point 35 ounces so the same size it was a little bit more money like maybe $28 or so but when I tried it on it was very like tacky it felt like Mac's lip glass and I thought well I don't want to sleep with him something that feels like Mac's lip glass I mean that tacky on my lips at night that's just gonna be weird I'll stick to my pillow so I had in my hand and I also I asked said well do you have any other ones that you'd recommend and I asked a couple of people and they all recommended she said the number one best seller that we have in the store is Lani Asia's lip mask so I looked at it this one I actually bought it was cheaper and it was twice a size it's point 70 ounces by the knees it comes in vanilla watermelon and I think the other scent is Apple I bought the vanilla one so it's point 70 ounces it was $20 so it was cheaper than the other ones and it was double the price maybe that's why it's um maybe that's why it is number one bestseller I'm not exactly certain but it also comes with this doodad so it comes with an envelope like you're an invited to do something inside the envelope is this highly useless doodad but it actually is pretty it looks like something that a little teeny tiny Statue of Liberty would carry and be like oh this is for your lips pointless so you can a lineage can include this with the lip mask but I can't have a straw for my coffee just saying speaking of hi from New York so if you couldn't tell from earlier in the video when I said coffee you probably heard my new Yorkish miss so I am not using this I will never use this I got fingers that's what that word now here's the lineage point 70 ounces it's sleeping carrot lips sleeping mask vanilla it says for all skin but specifically it's for yo lips so I started using it already when you open it up it's got a doodad by the way it is definitely twice the size of the kills just take the do that off you will see that I did starts to use it the thing about this 1l is that it doesn't smell like a sweet vanilla does it smell like a vanilla perfume does it smell like a vanilla fragrance it smells like vanilla ice cream it smells like you know if it all ice cream when it has those little flecks of brown in it that are the vanilla bean that are crushed up it's like a subtle vanilla so it's not it's not horrible the thing about this one is that it's kind of glossy it's way glossy er than the Kiehl's one and it's not tacky like the tatcha one but it's not as mad as the Kiehl's so you can see it is shiny on my lips the keel sinks into your lips on a much deeper level in the morning I feel it's completely hydrated by the keels one this one not so much I've been using it for a couple of nights now and I don't feel as hydrated but it will get me through the coronavirus the pandemic all that stuff it will get me through by the way just so you know this I really hope everyone is taking the proper precautions and I do have to say Kim Kardashian Kylie Jenner kendall Jenner Khloe Kourtney all of them you anyone has the rights to say anything that they want you know but I do have to say kudos to them and to the Surgeon General for really stepping up at this time and posting videos about social distancing and about how much they love each other but they are keeping their distance because it's such a phenomenal thing to use those platforms for such a good reason and to inspire people to stay apart I I saw people I've seen people doing an outdoor yoga class in the park and I'm thinking why like you can do things you can definitely do things apart if you live with someone if you have a boyfriend if you have a girlfriend if your partner or wife husband or whatever it is you definitely do things together but it's clear if you're doing a yoga class together if you're convening in a large group and like having a picnic but that's kind of probably not who you're living with and you're risking things so not a public service announcement but you know if you think that you're invincible and you think I can see my friends and you think I could do this I could do that well you can also carry the sickness with you unknowingly and give it to a parent or a grandparent a loved one unknowingly and it can affect them horribly so please make sure you're taking the proper questions and yeah you can sell it like I have I have a jacket on right now and yeah I have my glasses on but you know it's just because just because I thought it was cute the jacket so yeah just make sure you're okay and that's what one could ask for it's a weird time and yeah it's just a weird time but we'll get through this so I have to stay I have to stop saying um and I have to stop being so Cologne speak up um and I'm not gone I'm just it's tough time so that being said I hope I legitimately some secretly hope everyone's okay and yeah just make sure you use your phone make sure that you talk to your loved ones send out the good energy the good vibes if you're not feeling well stay home and if you're feeling really really bad get proper medical attention obviously and that's about that's about it I I feel like I'm not going to Marie Kondo my life that's not going to happen I I can't break out of my life I can't have eight books I can't do that but I can clean out a closet I can clean out a storage bin or something along those lines not sure what's gonna happen but if you if you if you're an eBay or find me on eBay blinks in my about Me section I don't know what I'm saying I don't know if I'm gonna sell anything at this point I took most this stuff down or I sold most the stuff we gave it away everybody buy at this point there might be two things left on there but who knows what's gonna happen so I will see you all soon Instagram is the bad enabler as one word I'll you know I'll see you all soon just be well and leave me a comment in the section down below if you get bored I went to Zn do so xoxo everybody and if you need a sleeping mask wait for keels or you could try a lineage but I probably wouldn't I think that it's only selling so well because it's 20 bucks but it'll have to suffice Josie Maran would you please come out with a sleeping mask for a night just make it all argan oil she came out with new skin care by the way but I want it in the combo set and I just that's what I want so new skin care we'll see I keep looking at QVC to see if it's on but no dice she hasn't been on I just got the emails about it so I'll see you all soon exhale exhale exhale exhale exhale exhale exhale
