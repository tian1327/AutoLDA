  good morning everybody and welcome back to a new vlog with me aline if you're new here hello as i said my name is aleene i am usually a 22 year old lady living and working in new york city i am an actor comedian and writer but uh no no not anymore because of covid i mean i'm technically all those things still but definitely not in new york right now me and michelle my sister who this channel is half of as well are in our family home in montana so very different from our usual scene this morning i am feeling very in a funk i slept weird does anybody sometimes if they stay up too late start getting angry about things that are like three years old because that's what happened to me i started digging up in my brain that i thought i'd really like put to rest and was done with and then i was like yeah i am still mad about that my god i was up too late and then i slept real weird i don't know was it fun my glasses are dirty hold on so to get out of this weird headspace cinnamon i'm gonna try to stay productive but also like not in the toxic way just in the way that i am getting some things that i need to get done the things that i need to get done at this point because i am unemployed are like email this person from college fun fact um back in the day i graduated early so when i graduated early i was cleared to graduate early and then i did my ceremony and everything and then like a week after i graduated i got an email from my advisor and was just like i am so sorry you are 12 credits short and it has been like a year-long endeavor by me procrastinating what needs to get done which is just i actually just need to fill out a few forms my professors are really coming in clutch and they're gonna fix this for me so basically i just need to fill out paperwork in order to get it done but it made me so not anxious but it was one of those things that i like i was angry about that i was frustrated with and i just didn't want to touch for like a really long time but um now that i'm in quarantine i'm like well might as well get that goddamn piece of paper that i earned so i am finalizing that today and then i have to order new running shoes because mine are old so nice and then i'm gonna order some t-shirts this morning because uh i didn't bring any summer clothes to montana and it looks like uh we're gonna be here for the early summer at least because i literally have this one and i think i have two others yeah then i will try to get in a workout today michelle how are you come in here you look great questionable how you doing i'm good i had like a rough last week so this week is already a lot better nice comparison i'm gonna go back to work okay and i'll go downstairs with you because i got some stuff to do hi guys so i'm gonna interrupt the video now with this fun little pop-up oh my god what is this what is this pop-up what a little surprise linear storytelling it is because we have a little bit of a sponsor we're so excited because this video is sponsored by skillshare and we feel very legit because skillshare is a phenomenal platform it's very cool that sponsors so many youtubers that we know and love and it's also a service that we've been super interested in for a while oh yeah absolutely there's nothing i like more than promoting learning so if you didn't know skillshare is a super cool digital learning platform this works so well i think with the whole quarantine situation that we're all in no better time than the president uh it allows you to learn from home and learn about so many things that you're interested in you get to learn from people who really know their stuff that's amazing i was just on their browsing today and i was like excuse me here is a personal essay writing class from the one and only roxanne gay yeah incredible excuse me the opportunities are actually endless and i think especially for us who we are self-taught in a lot of the things that we um love doing for example like video editing or digital art graphic design things like that especially for my job i think that it's very important to always be learning always be adapting and it's also just very fun for personal use like my bullet journal and then just my doodles so i am really excited to keep using skillshare throughout this quarantine to expand on my knowledge and my skill set and yeah we just think it's such a phenomenal resource such a good deal too great price very accessible if you click the link down below you can get two whole months free unlimited classes which is absolutely phenomenal a lot of people ask me for career advice and i think the number one thing you can do to set yourself apart is to have a skill set or a portfolio of work that shows that you're actively pursuing and are passionate about the work that you do another great career negative wisdom for you and as we all know i recently made a shift in my uh career and professional goals i extended my title from actor to actor comedian and writer so i'm always trying to become a better writer a better comedienne a better storyteller resources like skillshare are super helpful when you feel a little bit lost and floundery because you're like i can't teach all of this to me by me going back to school or going to school at all can get very very very expensive and none of us need more student debt at this point so this is a little treat for you we know how hard things are right now and hopefully uh you can enjoy a couple months of free classes and distract yourself a little bit from the craziness that's going on right now and yeah we hope you're all doing okay and staying safe yeah we love you all right back to the video hello so i'm in the kitchen now i'm gonna make myself a coffee hey mom where's the other uh blue oat milk so starting off with a jar and i just have my oat milk here on hand we use the oat milk barista blend it is phenomenal the best one michelle does buy it for the house because it is quite pricey but it is a burden she is willing to take on for the good of the family so let's give this a taste i'm pretending as if i haven't tasted it before but come along with me on this rose okay now that is pretty actually tasty like don't get me wrong it's not my favorite it is what it is cheers to a morning of productivity hey guys so it is now currently like two o'clock just just became two and i've got done with everything i wanted to get done this morning i know technically it's like the afternoon but what is time during these times am i right or am i right so now i'm very excited because the fun part of my day can start i know a lot of you are going to be like you are online shopping how is that not the fun part of your day and i'm like yeah you got me for me anything that i have to do is automatically not a fun thing so um yeah i'm pretty chaotic and also a child what do i want to do in the afternoon well i want to go get ready somewhat so i don't look this way also i don't want to shower because my hair looks kind of good but also my scalp is so dry it's starting to bleed a little bit hashtag montana air oh thank you mama so that's a little tmi for you guys hashtag bloody scalp um maybe i'll put on some a fresh pair of sweatpants that aren't slightly sticky on the thigh from who knows what i know i have to go on a hike and i know i have to i have to edit this tick tock i don't know if you guys heard what i'm going to talk it's uh it's pretty cool i have one tick tock that is currently blowing up and has over like 21 000 views as of now um and it's pretty thrilling so don't be intimidated now that i am essentially a celebrity welcome to the show i'm still the same old me um quarantine vlogs are becoming a little bit weird i genuinely am running out of ideas of what to say to y'all because i'm like this is so boring but anyway a lot of you guys reached out and said that they have been comforting to you in some kind of way and that means a lot so thank you you're making streusel cake i am this whole time hey everybody i'm here with um some coconut curry for lunch pretty delicious my mom did make it um it tastes real good oh i might start editing that tik tok that i was telling you all about so productivity people so i'm not somebody's watching this going like what i'm literally being like i'm so productive and i was like i bought shoes we got a lot of paint yeah if i had more people i get so much more hate they'd be like trash i'd be like i never said i wasn't i do want to be serious for a sec and say that i am aware that my workload and the stuff that i vlog isn't strenuous and isn't anything stressful and comes with a great deal of privilege i am so aware yeah i'm very lucky during this time i'm on unemployment i'm not spending any money besides with my my t-shirt cash i'm in a position that i don't think a lot of people uh get to be in right now i'm taking off things that are on my to-do list so that when i go home to new york i'll be set up for greater success update time um obviously you can tell probably by the evening light um it's much later i ended up accidentally going on like an hour and a half long bike ride probably if i were to take a guess i would say 12 to 14 15 miles tops it was good i had fun it was very beautiful um it was a nice way to celebrate earth day which is what today is i'll put in some pictures here and now i've got my food vegan shepherd's pie made by my mom a queen she's doing a virtual play reading with some friends tonight um so she's in my dad's office over there so if you hear a muffled voice that's her speaking and we're all kind of just like doing our own thing i might go and watch some comedy or something um in the family room because i'm really really hungry now  this is it yeah  good morning everybody it is currently sunday and i have just really awoken today i did wake up to the sound of my cat vomiting so three cheers for felines so i cleaned it up which was exactly the kind of sunday errand i crave and now um i'm in my pajamas still so i'm thinking like what's she wearing it's just like uh nothing good michelle is here michelle is off camera i'm sure say hello hi and oh i guess i can show you bam she's beauty she's great you look great oh wearing her sister's leftover shirt yeah you see because while we came here we didn't know we would be coming for this long so we have essentially no summer pajamas so we have been wearing my dregs of pajamas that i left here when i moved to new york so you're welcome for the shirt michelle yeah thanks the today should be really fun it's a gorgeous day like so blue i think it's supposed to get into the high 60s which is a um which is a warm temperature michelle's making coffee which i'm excited to have in my body we might take a picnic as a family today which is fine i'm just gonna run with our mom this morning while i'm gonna have a bit of a writing morning because i have some work to get done on my play that i'm writing i don't think i've told you about my play i think every single time i've talked about the play i've edited it out me and my friend jenna for those of you who don't know jenna i think she was very briefly introduced in a vlog we met at a summer intensive in new york um like two years ago and immediately we were just like buddies she has been just a forever friend we got to see each other last summer in the city and that was amazing and because of quarantine we recently started a writer's group because we both are interested in writing as well and specifically writing our own work as actors so we have been meeting once a week and exchanging pages for the other to give feedback on and then setting uh check-in dates so that we can have more to present to the other on that particular day it's been so beneficial on keeping me productive and also it's a wonderful excuse to talk to a really good friend who i value so i have to write this morning okay so i'm here outside on i i guess it's like our patio the sun is shining fresh air does wonders to the soul and um i've got some ideas i really want to knock out oh it's so cold my neck it looks  so   so  so   hi everybody so we are back at the house now from our big hike with the family i put on some makeup earlier that's why i look like a person we are currently making alcoholic beverages again to take to the park mom what are you making i'm making up it all spritz where's my little measuring thingy that i just broke up i don't know where it is no you took it okay give me my measuring thing and a splash of soda water we're muddling here we're muddling with the muddler excuse me excuse me excuse me enter the drinking portion of quarantine you have to put your beer in something you can't drink it like that you're not allowed to have open containers and farts but it's not alcoholic but people don't know that it's not a lot of whiskey you want makeup i mean it's strong but isn't it take a sip of those but you can taste the basil on the berry yes right it's more later it comes yep it comes after it's really gonna say hi guys so we are here together again actually all four of us because we are going on a family picnic it was michelle's idea really um should you explain what i explained what we're doing i am the events coordinator of this family and that is just true the honest tea was it for you we wouldn't get out of bed basically we're gonna go pick up some food from a local spot we ordered some really good eats y'all you're going to see in a bit and then we're going to go to a park and enjoy the nice weather pick up could have said our mother says just now as you probably heard with your ears what do you guys have to say and wait for my burger come on guys come on well done with bacon and yeah don't talk to me anymore let's follow bolognese i figured it out i'm so smart you have to open that one because i need a salad look at her also look at her beautiful basket i have a trash can what's called a complimentary fried cheesecake wow holy that's so nice that's that montana charm green mall here you go thanks lovely okay let's let's go through what we got okay here me and michelle have shared the spaghetti bolognese the burger and the fries you got a burger right what did you add to it blue cheese and bacon excellent ma what did you get i got the wild salmon cakes and a um green salad with beans nice and we got a complimentary fried cheesecake uh the chocolate tort and the cheesecake so uh we gotta give a big shout out to everybody at scotty's table here in missoula montana  it's really frustrating  good morning everybody and welcome to a brand new vlog um not brand new vlog it's just a new day it's just a new day i did not film monday quite frankly monday was boring and also me michelle loki had a collective mental breakdown um why you might be like why why the answer is because we've been loki um keeping our eye on the new york real estate market because we still are planning to hopefully make a move this summer in new york and of course i don't just mean move back which is a which is a given but also our lease is up at our apartment um and of course when we left we thought that we would um be back in time to apartment hunt and uh move into the new apartment uh when the lease was up on june 1st but corona had other plans and has really taken a toll on the city so we don't know exactly when we're going to be back in the summer we've asked for a lease extension from our landlord and um we haven't heard back yet but i think that the fact that he hasn't said no right away is a good sign but anyway while we've been like on the apps looking for apartments it's not even looking looking right it's just mostly for fun and also just it's perusing yeah good choice of word michelle but then we found like the most perfect apartment for the most perfect price and most perfect location when i say perfect location i mean perfect location because it's literally in michelle's old neighborhood which we were obsessed with which is kind of like prospect heights crown heights area if you live in new york you know frankly i have it was like just off of franklin ave this beautiful pre-war apartment close to prospect park close to the subway like 0.1 miles from the near subway station like down the street from bagel pub it had things to its pro list that we didn't even dare to dream of and it was this rent control department so it was somehow so cheap we were in touch with the realtors on the property because we suddenly like freaked out and it turns out that movement was just like soon as available like latest would be like may 15th and we are just simply not gonna travel in this in this climate obviously in the grand scheme of things it's just like well not that big of a deal but for a moment we just had this had this big dream of like wow the perfect place for us to live our lives it's one of those other reminders that like if we were in new york and if this wasn't happening we would be apartment hunting right now and we might be able to be able to live in a place like this i don't know people could be like weird about this stuff but apartment hunting in new york is so intense and things go so quick and it's so hard to live in a neighborhood that you want to live in at a reasonable price i don't know say what you will or think what you will i guess because this is a one-sided conversation again people are literally dying and i'm just missing out on an apartment today should be a fun day because i am baking bread which is always a joy and i'm actually meeting up with some friends for the first time since i've been in montana don't worry we are going to literally go and meet up at a park and be six feet apart and apply rules of social distancing you could not talk me into meeting up with a friend and being like this here in montana things are reopening this week a little bit and our governor has released a reopening plan because we have so few cases or whatever but i don't know just to be safe i think that everyone should continue to kind of follow social distancing i got my new running shoes in the mail today which is so exciting i cannot express to you how excited i am i haven't had new running shoes in probably like two two and a half years they're so cute oh my god look at that oh i'm obsessed they're so pretty anyway these are oh my god they're so cute i love how they look kind of vintagey i'm obsessed and for asics a6 usually come in like some pretty heinous colors for those of you wondering what running shoes i use these are the gel kayano 26 because i have over pronation in my feet so i have to get the ones with the gel for the extra support so that i don't hurt myself okay guys so here's my poolish that has been resting for about 13 hours it got a really hefty rise which i'm pretty pleased with and it's super bubbly for those of you who wonder how i make my bread i've linked to the recipe before in the description but it's this ciabatta made easy at home by john kirkwood tutorial but i do change some things because i do follow the recipe exactly like he says it which is always very like so you must follow the recipe exactly the way it is and um i have and it's failed so i can tell you what i do differently so he says 12 hours i always do 13. foolish and he says to put it in the fridge and i don't i leave it out on the counter if i put in the fridge it literally does not rise this could also have to do with the different air qualities in montana versus the uk so i'm gonna go ahead now and add my water that i weighed out over there on my scale  ciabatta was the first bread that i made during quarantine and i didn't realize that shavada on the difficulty scale is pretty up there so i don't mean to brag but i'm gonna uh now it's just gonna slide out like some sort of alien blob fish into the  bowl i always say the teaspoon of table salt but i do add just like a tiniest bit more now that's all in the bowl i'm going to transfer it to my stand mixer  all right that's about how it should look  so now that's done i'm just going to cover it in a towel if you watch the video he says that he flips the dough every 45 minutes i don't because i don't get a very impressive rise uh when i do that um so i'm going to do every one hour and then the last flip after the last flip i'm gonna probably let it sit for two so people might be like that's not how you do it but this is the way that it works for me so i have made myself these baby toasts and uh michelle just called and said that she had some good news i have a little update in lifetime basically i just got an email right now as we're speaking from our landlord and he said that they're able to send over a two-month extension which basically means instead of our lease being up may 30th um it is now up july 31st which is so much more time to hopefully be able not only to like maximize our time here in montana and not rush to get back to new york and put ourselves and others at risk it just gives us a more concrete date in order to like look for apartments and also just gives us time to apartment hunt and not have to rush out of the space and also not have to sign on for another year with our current place honestly like we do enjoy it but it's just one too expensive two the neighborhood is just too far from everything we need to get to let's be honest like my work your current work and also just like to get into manhattan or to hang out with friends like it's just like two out of the way and three the art we just don't have enough transportation options so hopefully our next place will be more of a long-term stay like a place that will move and stay put for a bit oh okay good measure now i'm gonna leave it for another hour okay now it's time for turn number two wow she's fluffy she's gonna be good i think oh good spring spring hey everybody i'm just about to go on a run the bread is rising um the dogs think that they're going with me which is very sad because they are not yeah just gonna get some miles in pretty quickly and then i'm going to bake my bread so i'll see you guys after my run okay so i just got done with my run and it was very hard i'm not gonna lie i only went two miles but it's all good not all progress is linear so now i am just flowering my station so now what you want to do is you just want to turn it over i'm going to cover them and i'm going to let them rise for like a good 20 minutes all right guys i'm about to have a snack i've got some baby carrots here a little bit of hummus and then also a couple slices of fresh mozzarella why because i want to if you are out of things to do during quarantine i highly suggest trying to work on healing your relationship with food hi guys so it's much later um i uh baked the bread and i was very much in a rush because i'm terrible at time management um and the bread was taking longer to cook this time for some reason i think that because i let it set for so much longer the crust was so much thicker i don't know i don't know all the intricacies of bread science so yeah i'm running a little bit late sorry to both of my pals uh who i'm keeping waiting so i'm sorry about that but i'm very excited to go and see them it's a beautiful day so and i have a little bag here of a blanket and some carrots and hummus and i can't wait to sit and chat with you saying how uh  into the trees the the what started this all is the freaking dog
