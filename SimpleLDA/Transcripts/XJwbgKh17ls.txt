 hey guys uh quarantine diary we are now on day 31 of quarantine and it's been a journey it's been up and down this is really dragging on and who knows how much longer it's gonna drag on and this is like what life is now which is god it's terrible I don't want to get depressed again so I'm not going to dwell on it so around 8:20 a quarantine I started spiraling into depression and um you know I've got supportive people in my life and I kind of come out of it on the weekends and then go back into it during the charting weeks but on day 31 you know yesterday was Easter and my parents did a really weird Korona Easter in the time of corona they hit an egg hunt all around their yard and then went inside their house and watched from the windows as I released my children into their yard to go hunt the eggs so they watch from behind the window the children egg hunting so we wouldn't obviously give them coronavirus and killed them dead but yeah that's what Easter became this year no feast nothing oh but I mean you gotta be creative right in these days to keep yourself from losing hope so around 8:20 I spiraled into a depression here's some footage I feel here's some footage off the UM - I was really depressed just give you a realistic idea of what that was like as to 15 ways the pandemic is triggering my post-traumatic stress so I'm traumatized for when I got divorced and like lost all my worldly possessions and my entire lifestyle so there's like scarcity like whether you have money or not like scarcity on the shelves and not being able to get what you need so obviously I was completely completely impoverished after the divorce completely uh you know relying on my parents with two little children uh so you're right with two little children in the middle of a pandemic and it's sometimes like you can't get everything that you need and it's completely beyond my control so that's triggering I mean we're fine it's just like a trigger to the time when we weren't fine after the divorce I had panic before the divorce because I was trapped in a really bad marriage my panic disorder I was felt really trapped in the marriage and then after I got out I was trapped by life circumstances I'm trying to rebuild my life and so these panic attacks that was a yoga teacher and I did all sorts of other teaching and stuff like that but at some point my panic got so bad that I couldn't teach anymore good I just have a panic attack and not anxiety like debilitating panic attacks so this pandemic is triggering me with that because I can't go to teach yoga and it's like is this my debilitating panic disorder or is this a pandemic it's obviously the pandemic but it's triggering me but take it with a grain of salt because um day 30 I saw day 31 stay 32 31 I had a kind of a tenday deep depression and I don't want to say I'm totally out of it but maybe I'm out of it fingers crossed top situation so yeah I've been in it I in the pit of depression they pit the absolute pit I don't remember when I ever I've been so depressed which outside of coronavirus my life is going just right I love the people in my life I love my relationships I love my job I love filming here that's going well but most all of those things are affected by coronavirus and the scarcity and the isolation of quarantine is triggering for me but anyway let's take a look at Easter that was pretty good I started to come out of my depression Easter are you guys so that's what's been up I've been round the price then we had Easter the garden is sprouting but I have predators nibbling in on my seedlings as fast as they're coming up I think I've got rabbits birds slugs probably more than rabbits birds and slugs yeah they're attacking from all fronts I'm definitely organic I have a lot of creative solutions but this time of year is always hard because one of my creative solutions in the garden is just over planting like I just plant a ton so that there's enough for the bugs and the animals to eat and still some for me to eat we're still early in the season so I just need to put out a ton of C's and kind of seedlings and persist so today we're kind of back to the grinds gonna do some cleaning around here maybe some organizing           you
