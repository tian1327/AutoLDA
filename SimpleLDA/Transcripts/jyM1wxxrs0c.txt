like down here these are just black biker shorts sized sweatpants these are just boyfriend joggers it augurs but they're like high-waisted and they're in white anyone feeling generous my venmo is that Caroline okay i this one video that has like over 200,000 views since because it has the words boob in the title like i posted it in this like last summer and I didn't even get anywhere close to like this many views I think people are like mostly like middle-aged men are just really bored right now I'm going to do something with my life now okay me myself some frozen mac and cheese and then I'm watching the show called Outer Banks on Netflix yes I always sit like this one before I don't know why find a picture to put on Instagram I don't know I don't even talk about what I post on Instagram anymore honestly like I just want to make it casual and I feel like I post pretty much like whatever I want whatever I want to I don't even think there's any rules I just think people do whatever they want to do in that's fine that's why I like visco because it's like so much more casual but let's make Instagram casual again so weird you can look at a picture and you know exactly how you felt at that time what you were doing like what was going on in your life who your friends were you know  Oh baby like I vacuum my room like every tooth for a minute oh come on I miss shows like oh I'm here and why is this not loading like it's making yeah I'm gonna grow I just change into this champion white anyways okay I'm about to show you so I'm gonna get copyrighted I need to brush my teeth ready to have a memory triggered that you don't even know still existed babe look at this video now if you didn't have one who even worried you as a child you put the videos in here oh okay open it and I even have one in here it's the mrs. dimmsdale and mind over magic episode of Fairly OddParents that is so freakin funny oh my god I don't have the charges up but I'm gonna make a tik tok I've been having an ant problem if you guys have watched my last few episodes they just have been taking over my room which is really disgusting I hate bugs I mean ants like it could be worse I'd rather just have not any living creatures in my room my dad sprayed the other day so I don't know why we are going to do my French I'm gonna edit a photo first to put it on Instagram be a challenge okay I'm also like so late to this party but there's like the Spotify sessions and they have ones for pop covers Indian roots rising so I'm listening to the indie one right now and it's Vance joy never shut its Vance joy lay it on me and it's so freakin good  okay so I'm doing my French on mark or Lundy for Monday can marijuana free to push the release homepage some tweet ecstasy Sunday sink and that was my projection for you all and I'm never doing it again but I'm gonna listen to ratatouille to soundtrack while I do it gets to be the mood age why don't we and I think we're doing like the future tense stuff I'm an English is hard okay I'm not gonna only discount how hard English is because I would like to talk to Franck he would ask the questions about English and like 9 times out of 10 the role doesn't make sense so there's like an exception to the rule or something every language has conjugations but this one is like different because you have to like add different there verbs to certain verbs to add conjugation it's just like super confusing and there's a lot of like exceptions and stuff but I'm minoring in French actually so I better get my together because hehe but that will open my options up as far as career goes I'm trying to become an industrial psychologist which is like someone who like it's a psychologist for like people in business and like corporations how people work together better and like analyze personalities be a part of interviews to like interview high executives at companies to see how well they would manage a large group of people stuff like that so I got like work in France if I wanted to I'm gonna do this and then I'm gonna look at my assignment for history I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it all right now just cuz it's probably kind of extensive that's like a replacement assignment for like a field trip that we were supposed to go on if we were still in Paris but I got an a on my debate that we had last week which I'm surprised because I worked on that until he 3:00 in the morning the night before and I didn't prep it all so we're doing well okay so anyway what does I don't like cleaning I can't beat up my own apartment that's better baby the day my life begins watch tangled for the first time but it was really good okay I'm gonna make it smoothie Bowl so I'm gonna keep my senses smoothie stuff talk where it's like putting Tupperware away just like open the drawer I'd like to throw it in and then shut it it's a shot glass taking shots of ouzo the other night a Greek alcohol I don't know what this is what this is now I can actually clean the dish that's good now we're gonna make this mini Bowl Oh son this is my famous smoothie Bowl recipe highly requested from y'all so I use a Vitamix blender really good one I used the silk oh yeah milk I just got it kroger it's the regular version the plain one they also have the vanilla but I don't really love the taste okay but for this one I don't have a set measurement for how much milk I put in it usually that like more is better than this because you really don't want the blender to get like up cuz I've done that too many times my mom screams at me every time I don't put ice in it because I use frozen fruits that kind of like felicity ice a little bit and usually I'll use like a fruit blend from Kroger it's like grapes mango pineapple strawberries but I don't have any right now I ran out this morning I'm using the very cherry berry blend from Trader J I use these these berries for toppings right now I don't have any other presents right so we're just going to do something I'm gonna be some frozen pineapple from Coburn's and bull cheese organic freshly frozen extra sweet pineapple I think rose and pineapple is like the one of my favorite fruits better frozen that in grapes is this a trick to doing this is it can get really messy really quickly because you have so many ingredients like fruit nut butters oat milk South the wazoo so it's good just like put things away while you're doing it and you should take me like half an hour to like make the ball get the ingredients out but the ingredients the way clean my stuff like it took me so long in there by the time I actually ate the ball it was like melted I'd become like an expert on how I do it whole banana I would say to just like a medium sized it was nice - nice to know yeah everyone go follow me on tip talk is at proko see with three C's good times looks pretty good oh yeah protein powder and then like when I go into the pantry to get my dry stuff I try to make it an efficient trip so I've got like all my other dry ingredients time is money money is time - I do one skip of the simple truth whey protein powder the vanilla also got this at Kroger a little pricey this was like $13 but I love the taste but it makes everything taste so much better it keeps you filled up for longer so this is what it looks like put the top on - then I get out my blender right now the outlets in our house I got actually all working so the only one that works in our kitchen is the one over here so I'm gonna bring this over here little contraption I use this instead of just like the topper because I can move around the fruit and stuff if it does get stuck in the bottom kind of sawn and I don't really have a particular setting I do it too I just do like medium to high ish I guess and I do like it a little bit chunky a little chunky alright and then I take this out we get to see the flavor ma chefs kiss so good telling you guys the protein powder really adds something to it some people don't like the taste of way which I can understand but I'm saying it is the key to all your success just like washing it as I go I immediately put my mixer away oh my quest trip over my cat's food jar depending on how liquidy it is sometimes it just falls right out of the container I don't think it's going to in this case it's a little more solid if I just get out as much as I can for any excess I use a rubber spatula she would get this and I love making smoothie bowls at home cuz you don't have to pay for it number one not paying $12 every single time I wanna get a ball she we can put in any ingredients that you want I don't know I just love like mixing I've been doing different flavor combinations except pro tip I have noticed my only you strawberries and bananas in the mix I think it has to do with the bananas but the texture becomes so weird it was really like sticky and like the ready sort of it was really bad and I actually didn't eat smoothie Bowl it's for like a week after that because I was kind of like really grossed out so maybe don't just do like banana another fruit because the banana kind of makes it weird and then as far as dry talking so I always do some chopped dates I do studies at Kroger I think they're like rolled in sugars that's why I like them just coconut there's actually more like coconut like chips that's what they're called these are from program and then I do some sort of cereal to replace granola I do like granola but that being said it tends to have a lot of fat and a lot of calories and I'm not saying that like you should pay attention that by all means you speck of granola if you want to I just don't like using it if I can use like cereal that has less of that but in life I love life on popular opinion I've loved it ever since I was little then it does get kind of like big so I have to cut it down with the spoon and you're done and then I actually just forgot the peanut butter slush almond butter so we don't have any more peanut butter or almond butter like this is all we had left so this is just Justin's almond butter with like honey and then this is just extra crunchy peanut butter by Jeff and now it's done okay little update with you guys it's like right up the stairs I'm at a bath also drinking a white cloth tangerine really good okay Gary talked the ton about this because like illegally I'm not going oh wow dude but if you've been watching me for a while you know that my old relationship I did really really badly and I was a mess and I I've just been going through it for the past like nine months for me it was just really really difficult because I never got closure for how our relationship ended I got closure last week last Friday I did I'm not gonna say how I'm not allowed to say how I did get closure and I feel so much better I can't even tell you like ever since last Friday it's like a switch has going off and I feel totally myself again I feel happy I feel free like I didn't lose anything I'm gaining freedom I didn't even know that that's how it would affect me Lee getting closure and that's all I wanted for the past nine months I'm so happy that I finally got it yeah it's really all what hi I'm vlogging I'm just downstairs guarding anyways I'm not gonna talk about it anymore I have nothing to say about it I'm happy and I'm moving on you're better things hopefully I'll
