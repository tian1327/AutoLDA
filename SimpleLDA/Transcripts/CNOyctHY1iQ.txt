 good morning everybody so I thought that I would do a vlog based on my routine during this special interesting period that we are all in me open blends whoa I've been living in this house for about you guys no I moved if you saw the last long but I've been living in this house for over three weeks actually maybe approaching one month now and because there is a stay at home order in my state specifically Washington State I have literally been doing the same thing every day building a routine one of my biggest concerns moving was like you know might miss my old home and my missed appearance all that stuff but I think having this quarantine like the silver lining is actually forcing myself just to stay here and stay put and I found that I have built some sort of daily routine but luckily and thankfully I am allowed to work from home so a lot of my weekdays are pretty much the same and I thought I would do a vlog based on to tell you guys what I do during my daily life whether it is like working you guys know I got this new desk or like eating how I get groceries or how I get things home to the house how I can fill the time so to speak between like keeping myself occupied gonna do all that today today's a Friday so it's very it's hard because it's like TGIF thank God it's Friday but really ain't got nowhere else to go quickly when I first get up I make my bed and I wash my face and then I make a coffee before my first meeting today my first meeting at work is at 9:00 and look so let's make the bed this is the finished bed usually I move a lot which makes all of the blankets all of the sheets kind of ruffled and stuff but today was a lot easier I didn't move as much I typically just kind of fold everything to the top and then fold it over and then just tuck to the sides in a few of you guys have been wondering about like my linen I don't remember where I got this this was at home I ended up getting this duvet cover from West Elm I believe this under grey blanket is from Costco this is from TJ Maxx and I have a big assortment of pillows this is from slip this is from TJ Maxx maybe IKEA West um I think I've had this for a while maybe IKEA and West Elm it's it's nice to have the bathroom really really close turn on the light right here next to my bedroom in the mornings I typically do the skincare routine let's get started this is probably gonna take like five minutes so I might speed up some portions when I first start out I use the Neutrogena oil-free acne wash this have salicylic acid and I just let this sit in my skin for a little bit so I let this sit in for at least like 20 seconds longer so that the ingredient can just sit on my face then I wash off now I've had my face with a towel remember to pat your face and not drag it if you don't want that premature aging on your skin the next thing that I use is a vitamin C serum I think today I'm going to be using this green tangerine vitae C dark spot serum I got this from Korea it's in the brand goodall and I did a couple pumps and then I just pat on my sin I always remember to get the product on my neck and the back of my hands I'm gonna let the strive for a little bit while I do that I'm gonna put on some deodorant I use the Method Man in juniper in Sage the next thing that I use is this is a prescription medication azelaic acid cream this is point actually 15% for my acne I usually put in a little pea-sized amount like that the next two products that I use are used in conjunction with each other the first one is a humectant which is a type of skin care that is helped to retain water on your skin this has I believe how long Cassidy is from the brand how to love oh it's called their perfect gel and then afterwards right after I use something that is a little bit more inclusive and this is the ultra Repair barrier mitt cream from first date Beauty this is for sensitive skin so this is going to be a little bit more inclusive meaning that it's gonna continue make your skin soft so that it acts as like a bear here to the humectants oh I put them one on top of each other and then that's that I've been doing this for maybe a year now after watching and researching some videos from dermatologists and I've found that it works for my skin and I am going to use a sunscreen even though I'm at home sometimes I work from a window that has sun shining through it and on my skin so yesterday like it was sunny in the dining room and kind of put some on so I think today I'm going to use this one this is from elta MD it is their UV clear broad-spectrum SPF 46 sunscreen and I try to be very liberal with this and as you guys know you're supposed to reapply at least three times a day because the sunscreen doesn't last like all you know 1416 hours that you are up you want to make sure to rub that and I forgot what the equation is for making sure that it has a good enough product for like square inch on yours on your skin and that is my skincare routine this is without any makeup I'll put on my contacts in a bit also if you guys are enjoying this type of video let me know down below and thumbs up this video we're in a really weird time in the world right now and I might be doing a little bit more indoor blogs because I one have two and two I can't really get out of the house three like I don't know being in a new space is exciting I'm so in the process of making this space my own and because of this you know the situation we're in I you know have to pause some stuff so I hope you guys understand so excuse I'm wearing literally my Uniqlo Underpants because it gets cold down here since I'm in the bottom but let me take you guys to the kitchen so every morning I do like to open the blinds turn on the Keurig and then get my coffee from it's covered I have been loving these mugs I got them from Target so this is securing machine that we have at home I think Jessica's parents got it and so right beneath there is little drawer that pulls out I usually have been using for my first coffee the illy intense so Keurig a little capsule carry cup so I just put old one in the garbage or actually having the garbage kinda opens on Magli has been clutch but because this is a smaller coffee cup I'm going to make it so that it's an 8 ounce because it's not that big diva's love that sound in the morning just the sound of coffee just dripping onto your mug so after this is done I grab it and then I wake make wake I make my way down back to my room to get my just set up for my first meeting of the day so this is my desk you guys probably saw this in the last vlog but I ended up buying the this coaster from Target been great for my mug but I think before I set up my desk I'm going to try and figure out what shirt to wear to my meetings I'm probably gonna be continuing to wear my underpants already know for those of you guys who are working from home the past month ain't nobody going to see from the waist down so let's figure out a cute top of course as per usual I think I might hmm maybe I'll go with this it has a nice little collar detail it's from forever 21 so as I said quarantine has just been very very hard and you pretty much have to build up a routine to keep sane and although I am wearing like a regular top like I said no one will know right I'm just kind of worried that by the end of this they've already I don't know if this is gonna be the same with when this is posted but as of April 3rd they've extended the stay at home order until May 4th and you already know my hair my nails is just gonna be a hot mess my brows you guys we are all going to be ugly together and that's ok right all jokes aside we will make it through it just stay indoors it is the best thing we can do in solidarity for those who are out in the front lines where essential helping us stay indoors that is the best that we can do if you don't agree me bite me also because the window is here and my table and camera and my laptop is here we're gonna turn on this light and then close these blinds so that we don't get some backlit not cute lighting for my meeting so in regards to my desk setup I have two different machines here I have my laptop which is for work and then I have my monitor which is an iMac that I use for personal stuff I can also use this as a second monitor when I connect my laptop with the iMac so let's do that so I already have my charging cord plugged in but then I plug in this other cord which is supposed to connect it to my monitor and then I go to the keyboard and I just click this to connect and now it is one monitor so if I like take this window it'll move up here so that's how I work y'all what up guys morning happy birthday oh my god it's a little break in the UI I know a star rating filter in it they off okay so first meeting is done and so I think I'm just gonna move upstairs to the kitchen to break the monotony of the day I've tended to work in different spots of the house so we have a little island here that I have been working out of I have a meeting another meeting with us in about 20 minutes so they gonna get another cup of coffee and maybe a little something-something I'll show you all so you guys know that we just moved in and we didn't have much alcohol stored so we made a big purchase yesterday and got all these things this has been already here but that's my brother stash but ended up getting a triple sec some Tanqueray gin some vodka which we already started yesterday some Jimador tequila and then for my coffee it's Friday so Yolo got some Bailey's Irish Cream so let's make coffee number two so whenever I make a coffee and I usually put like if it's not this brand I usually choose this one which is the caramel vanilla cream I end up putting some of the French Vanilla creamer but instead of this I'll be putting some Bailey's so let's make another coffee got the Bailey's I think I might make this ritual every Friday I think that during these interesting and the circumstances that we roll and I think we all have to definitely find ways to keep our day interesting or else it's going to make me stir-crazy do what you gotta do try to maintain your your mental health but also keeping all of like the guidelines that the CDC and w-h-o are are telling people I think that's fine I think maybe I should also define like we're only talking about okay so just ended my meeting and now because I have some time between right now and my next meeting I figured I'd get some laundry done so with my new pax wardrobe system I have this little pullout drawer that has my laundry I have one for like colored and then one for whites I think I'm gonna do colored laundry today so yeah I it's really nice because it literally has handles on it and it's already filled with the clothes my colored clothes I'm going to color it first man it is a very big bag so the laundry is on the third floor so let's walk up this is the laundry room we have a washer and a dryer so I'm gonna put this in here let's get a tide pod throw it inside close the door and let it let it run so it's 11 22 and jessica is putting some garlic bread on Hawaiian garlic on Hawaiian breads for like a sweet garlic bread in the oven what are you cooking in the stove butter pasta moving to another part of the house to take a meeting I might go in the couch  we're gonna have to do you educate this is Bert why is it burnt it looks good garlic Hawaiian bread and then buttered pasta gonna eat lunch right now so it's time to get the clothes for the washer what else do I have going on I have a few more meetings for the rest of the day I have a virtual happy hour so a lot of you guys have been wondering about you know how people kind of stay social while the social distancing commences and a lot of people have been doing social happy hours also because it's been about three hours four hours since I last applied my sunscreen I'm gonna do one more layer quickly put this on and I don't know how long this vlog is gonna be I hope you guys are still tuning in if you guys have made it this far in the vlog let me know down below okay back in the room I usually like to place all of the clean clothes on the bed and then place the little laundry bag back in the pullout over here oh let's put away some laundry okay with about five six minutes to spare finally put away my laundry folded ever actually I don't think I folded anything I just distributed it and then either hung it or place them the drawer surprisingly out of all house tasks I actually really enjoy doing laundry and folding and rearranging that's just what I like I don't like cleaning the bathroom so if you know anybody likes to do that I'm just kidding I'll do it myself also whenever I leave the room I turn off the temperature and then turn off the lights always just to save some energy I feel like we've been doing a lot of grocery shopping whether it's in person with you know social distancing or through delivery apps we haven't gone almost in a week do you guys want to see a what we get from the grocery store video okay so I'm gonna make myself a drink is Friday I feel like you're I feel like it's gonna be like oh you just had to drink earlier today but it is the end of the day I am making a drink in preparation for the virtual happy hour with my friends / coworkers this will not be work-related I am gonna be making a gin and tonic without without alliance which is fine I want to show you something really quick I don't have a bottle over with me but we have one that's fixed to the wall and the bottle cap and falls down to the trash bin it just falls down nope gonna show up this is gonna be like not scientific or precise Jin I mean Jin might be one of my underrated favorite kind of alcohol and then fill the rest with some tonic water tough fizzy that is yes if I look different it's because I for my virtual happy hour in a bit I ended up putting on some makeup and going on Instagram live yes my phone is on top of a box and being balanced by a gin bottle by me hey so I'm in a virtual happy hour they working out right behind me okay happy hour is done and now it's time to burn I'm the big son my own boss I'm yuan Kylie I mean when I'm garlic salt pepper that wasn't my okay maraming salamat so Jessica made lemon bars yes I ended up getting another coffee even though it's almost it's 9 o'clock actually that's okay tomorrow is Saturday okay so it is now 10 p.m. and even though it's a Friday night we're in quarantine y'all so I usually take a shower at night versus the day ever since I've been living here so I'm gonna take a shower okay so I just got out of the shower what I didn't show you on the camera I did a double plan so one cleanse two cleanses one with an oil based cleanser to help break up the makeup that I earlier today and then a second one that is more kind of easier to remove whatever was like broken down walking to my bed I like to end the day with lighting a candle which I have the rose water ivy scent that I've been loving from Bath and Body Works thank you so much for watching a day in the life of being quarantined day to day for me I don't know how long this vlog is gonna be but thanks for watching stay tuned for new vlogs to come if you guys have any recommendations of vlogs that I can do I was thinking about doing maybe more cooking like what I eat in a day or like workout vlogs especially like being indoors I'm tempted to do that but it's been it's been not a challenge but it's been interesting trying to adjust to this new normal that we're all having to experience but I hope you guys are saying safe staying healthy at home and once again thank you so much to everybody who has been an essential or frontline person during this pandemic I cannot express the amount of appreciation and gratitude that I have for you all so I will talk to you guys later bye
