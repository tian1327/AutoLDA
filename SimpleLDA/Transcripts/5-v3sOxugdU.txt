  so the motivation behind starting this vlog or even like a YouTube channel was to document with the entire quarantine process that is happening right now with us and as a student I would like to share my experience this so as you know the pandemic is already there so now I just go with 19 and it's causing a lot of trouble for all the people people are dying they are we were running literally on of like resources people are fighting for food and all so as a student for me like we what they plan like to be a quarantine we were like given holiday kind of to save ourselves and like living last Thursday yeah that's Thursday and it was 12 March today is Toni first so that Jesus is 13 9 and yeah as you can see it's almost 8 o'clock in the evening you're in Michigan good condition have been doing is like cleaning the room doing laundry frequently if like anybody is coming from outside spraying some auntie back to like I'm trying my best to keep the virus is out but I don't know like the numbers have already surpassed twelve thousand I think now it's only 21,000 something I saw it on New York Times when my bit is a visa decision and I hope everything is over but I will give you an update as soon as I do any other   today is day 10 of being a quarantine and so it's full of anxiety and full of pressure because you have to keep up with your academics also you're no part-time job that you do and also with the surroundings and so many changes happening it is so difficult to keep up a smile on your face because if you see the numbers they are like out crowing like you just can't take care you know say I'm dated March 22 at 451 p.m. more than thirty thousand cases and actually at least they say at least 31 772 and if I check the count in Michigan so you can see Michigan it's already past thousand so it's thousand thirty three with nine deaths I just don't understand what's going on but for you know being a contouring you need to keep yourself motivated and engaged in a lot of activities so I am working something here then you know Bollywood old Bollywood like 1990s song playing at the back with a cup of coffee and suddenly it's snowing it is literally slowing outside you can see like small flakes here and there but yes it's knowing this together and think of it later in time I am just gonna be there more appreciative to what Mother Nature towards myself  suppose we were saying that this is spreading and it has hit like the states like Washington Wisconsin Illinois's and around the area of New York and we never thought it would go this ban but looking at today's number we have already hit 33 K people and that all has rise to almost about 500 but so looking at the things that we do daily like you know grocery is maybe going to classes or classes I've shifted online the groceries that we do is like twice in a week hardly and then like we have to learn limit everything because you never know when we can run out of resources also you know you know when you're watching the kids on because I don't have any flights I'm doing first of April somewhere yeah I did try searching for you but I couldn't get any of it and then yeah pretty much you know social distancing not going out sitting at home being productive nurturing yourself nourishing yourself from within it has become so important suddenly we have all started gaining consciousness and started to think that we have taken mama earth for granted and we need to take a lot of steps to save her and you know appreciate life more appreciate every food meal that we get like I have never like when I was a kid I practiced us that before we had nice to say my grace and thank the thought but like when you growing up as a college you know you forget these things but now suddenly everything has come back and you've started appreciating life deep breath because you're alive you are not affected by any disease you are safe and sound your parents are safe and so on your family or friends are safe and sound and you have the amenities to take care of yourself but people can't people aren't dying all around the world and my request to you all that is once we cross this tunnel later when we reach the other end we should continue practicing like less pollution may it be like waste production may it be noise pollution what the pollution we should do a bit irrespective whatever happens don't take this for granted this was just like a warning from the nature like precautionary Act and you know oh please there's a lot to talk about but right now we are calling time and we have literally we can't have our minds to be productive to be creative but this is my day and this is my experience as being important time but I don't think it's gonna go away for next month because our classes have shifted online on until the end of the semester and we have no idea whether next semester is gonna come up like face to face classes or is it still gonna be online and now that I like I would be graduating in the next semester I'm a little worried about my graduation ceremony but everything of what I want everybody to be safe so that ceremony doesn't matter we need to still keep on practicing socialist merci
