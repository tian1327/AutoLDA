 so I know this video is a little bit different than our normal videos but I thought it was important to make because my family was actually affected by the corona virus and my mom was diagnosed with it it's hard to find what the virus is really like for actual people rather than just like whatever the news is putting out or sometimes you could find like a short video someone's made in the hospital or something about their experience but my mom and I decided it would probably be good if she could kind of vlog her experience what her days were like how she was feeling how long it's been that she's had it and things like that so you can really understand how it affects someone I think since how the virus affects people and what their symptoms are isn't showing a lot in the media like what it's truly like people are kind of taking it lightly and thinking oh it's not really that bad or it's not gonna affect me or it's not gonna affect my family members but I'm hoping this video can actually give you a little insight into what it's like if you are actually diagnosed with the corona virus we are almost positive my mom contracted the virus from work I'm not gonna say what type of place she works in or what her actual job is just for privacy reasons but if you just watch and pay attention you can probably figure out what type of job she has and where she got it from so now I'm just gonna let all of her blogs play and if you have any questions for me just put them in the comments down below and I'll try to answer them or I can ask her if she has the answers for them also I was originally planning to add some stuff in the beginning of this video about like how Japan is dealing with the virus and what it's like here and you know the 2020 Olympics were canceled so there's a lot happening but I decided since the video is already going to be long enough that next week I'll just do more of Japan focus video so if you have any questions about that as well or have anything to add you would like me to look into or touch on please let me know about that as well so now on to my mom's story so I'm on day two of my suspected coronavirus I woke up yesterday morning around midnight and with a fever just of like 100.7 so yesterday I I slept for almost six hours my temperature got up to a hundred point unearned two point six yesterday was the highest it got that was really the only symptom my head I mean I felt like I had a little sort of I would said it like a scratchy throat and then this morning I will when I woke up I'm a temperature still it was a hundred point eight and I felt like I had more like gurgling mucus here so I did call the local hospital has a Cove in nineteen help hotline and I told him my symptoms and they recommended I get tested so I called my family doctor and they spoke to on call and they entered it in order and then I drove up to the lab I wish I wish I could have taken a picture of the lab technician coming out in the whole respirator and a whole contact isolation with a gown and gloves so she swapped me and sent me on my way I didn't get out of the car of course so now it's the end of my second day yesterday wouldn't be able to do anything like this because I just felt so terrible and fatigued during the night last night I like I did not eat enough yesterday or the day before and so I was just super weak just felt like I was gonna faint every time I was tried to get up and go to the bathroom but today I've been eating something at every mealtime at least and definitely trying to drink enough water this is my setup this is my life I've got my chair on my bed and my thermometer and paper and tissues and so I'm thankful that I'm my I don't have a temperature tonight it was just ninety eight point two I'm definitely coughing a little bit more but it certainly is a dry cough from what I've read about other people's experiences you know day three might be worse so sort of see how that goes I have been doing things like prior to this for at least a month I've been taking like a thousand milligrams of vitamin C every day and I'll be taking black seed oil at least once or twice a day a teaspoon of it every day just to try to reduce my risk of getting ill so obviously it didn't stop me from getting well possibly getting the virus I won't know for six or seven days whether it's even tested positive which I find unbelievable in this day and age here but I've also been doing a lot of things those kinds of things to help me and then I've also I have a diathermic is a deep heat machine which I was using sort of on my face and throat to see if I could um if it could help clear up the mucus and then I also have like an infrared sauna tent so I've been using that so I am trying things that not everybody has you know at home I guess we'll see what tomorrow brings hopefully hopefully it's better and hopefully the things I've been doing you know are helping me to not to get better quickly or recover so your soap until I sleep well tonight well it's day three of my suspected coronavirus I've been quarantined in my room I did walk out on to the deck with my masking gloves through the room through the house and I I just like did some laps on the deck outside and sat outside for a few minutes even though it was like 30 degrees out just at least to get a little Sun on my face and some fresh air so I slept well my temperature was ninety seven point two this morning I haven't taken again this evening been around at 2:00 it was you know 98.2 or something like that so normal the only symptom I really have is that dry cough that sort of just catches you I don't really feel like I'm very mucusy at all happy that I seem to be progressing really well I think I'm doing a lot better compared to some of the other people that I've seen posted like some people seem to have start with a productive cough and you know coughing up sputum and stuff like that so I'm hoping that I'm I'm getting better I feel like I am I have been eating well drinking well I tried to take a nap today and I couldn't even fall asleep so I think I've been getting enough rest I'm going stir-crazy in the in the room okay it's not easy to be here and I had to do something for work and like something on the laptop and then respond to complete a form and like I've sort of felt like my brain was fuzzy I couldn't like figure it out how to send an attachment to my email and I don't know and then Jeff was getting all like upset with me I think that I couldn't figure out how to use a computer so anyway I don't know if I'm not quite all there yet I think I am but you know I haven't been tested a lot I'm basically I sit I sleep I read I watch TV I talk on the phone and I haven't even done my crossword puzzles yet I'm hoping that tomorrow will be an even better day and that maybe tomorrow I won't even have a cough I wish I could get my test results sooner than six to seven days that's what they said so I mean I almost sort of hope I have it cuz I hope that I have it and then I that I beat it you know so I have never taken any Tylenol or done anything to the fur fever reducing and you know I've kept up with my black seed oil and my vitamin C and my diathermy and resting and eating mostly good food I had three starbursts tonight after I had my vegetable soup that was my my indulgence today so anyway I'll check in with you tomorrow and hopefully I'll be even better so it's day four it's the morning last night my fever came back it was just a hundred one hundred point four something during the night but I got a headache I mean I slept okay got a couple time just freezing I'm gonna have a long-sleeve nightgown on and sweatpants and then I have a sweatshirt on too and I have like four layers of blankets one of them is including a heavy down comforter I wouldn't wish this on anyone because this is pretty rough I was always doing yesterday anyway I guess I'll keep resting and hope that tomorrow is better than today I went to the bathroom right when I got up and I was so weak I felt like I was just gonna faint I think I mean I'm trying to eat enough but the fever is burning up my calories so I probably need to be eating more today all I did was sleep my temperatures up to 102 point 6 seriously all day today I just got up to go to the bathroom I ate drank water took shower this morning and slept I probably looks up five hours during the day today I'm so chilled have trouble getting warm even though I have like two hot water bottles I have like it feels like 10 pounds of blankets on me I was so encouraged yesterday because I didn't have a fever all day and then started last night and then it's just gotten worse today I am sort of old school I've always believed that if you have a fever you feel that it's run its course it's the body's way of trying to fight infection and it's not gotten over 100 2.6 this is really horrible it's a it's a horrible virus I mean I'm healthy typically I mean how did my gallbladder removed last I don't have any chronic health problems my vitamin D level is optimal I exercise I typically eat good food and I mean this is just kicking my butt I am just gonna call my doctor tomorrow I just want to make sure they know that I was tested I'm be 99% sure that I'm positive and just to make sure I'm not missing anything I mean I can see how be so easy not to eat or drink because I do not want to eat or drink if you were elderly and you didn't have that drive you'd go downhill really fast cuz I've already lost a couple pounds and I really can't afford to lose that my husband has been awesome he's so good he brings me all my food and sets it out beside my door and picks up my dirty dishes and heats up the water for my hot water bottles and fills up my water bottle you know we try to maintain a six-foot distance at all times so I'm just praying he doesn't get it I mean he feels a little achy right now but I don't know Friday will be 14 days from my exposure so today's Monday night I'll check in with you tomorrow well I'm on day five so yesterday I slept all day last night I slept from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. I mean 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. when I woke up this morning I I still had a temperature of about just 100 I still just have a horrible headache 8 here just you know if I go like that I just just feel like I get it knife through my head my fevers been is no low lower than a hundred it's been up to Hunter 1.2 right now I feel like more hungry today I actually wanted to eat something I even had a hankering to have KFC so Jeff went out and I had a piece of chicken and mashed potatoes coleslaw and some of a roll and look at that was a huge meal for me one of my bigger problems right now is just like my low back and my hips are just like killing me I think it's just because I'm like not moving I mean I'm used to I'm a very active person you know at work I walk a minimum to 10,000 steps a day and I'm sitting on pillows it still just hurts me too it hurts more to sit than it does to lay down but so I'm trying to change my position every hour it sound like need turned every two hours the Cova 19 hotline called to check up on me today I just reported my symptoms they said my doctor will notify me when my results are available right now it's still taken at least a week so that won't be till Saturday and today's Tuesday I don't know I'm just I'm just miserable everything hurts I am so tired of watching TV you think oh nice watch whatever you want anytime you want it's like oh there is nothing on I did so hopeful when I had that great day on Saturday or Sunday and now I've had regression so anyway tomorrow's a new day I hope I can beat this thing sooner than later I never imagined that I would be doing this on day six of my suspected coronavirus still have a fever though it was like 99.5 this morning one hundred point seven two I'm instructed again now I have like a terrible headache which I've had non-stop something that's bothering me almost as much as a headache is that my body is so sore my like hips hurt and my lower back just because I'm not moving and it's just it's almost unbearable I don't know when it's gonna be over it's really unimaginable although I'm living it I'm getting sort of depressed cuz you know I know I don't know when it's gonna be over I sort of I'm gonna release or reduce the strictness of my quarantine right now we've been doing it for six days now and Jeff has like he's like a cold which he's had symptoms for quite a while so I we don't know if that's his coronavirus I mean I'm still gonna maintain six feet away but I've got to be able to sit downstairs like sit in the family room or something and watch TV or do something from a different position rather than sitting in a chair in my room we're laying in the bed flat on my back so I'm looking forward to that tonight it's like exciting I'm not really coughing this tiny little cough I've no respiratory issues early I have my window open cuz it's so beautiful so I'm hopeful every day I hope that tomorrow will be better it's really not not a lot of changes I'm sold just as bad I guess I'm just thankful I'm not worse but I'm just wondering when I'll turn the corner maybe tomorrow well this is um day seven finishing my day seven fever 101 this morning today's been a really hard day I've broken down a number of times just crying I'm like it's really hard to explain what this does to you like garel body's just exhausted because all you doing is having a constant fever I'm sleeping all night and you know hours during the day forcing myself to eat and drink and just this morning I mean I when I woke up I knew I still had a fever and headache and I don't know something about it just it's getting to me today I mean I I'm about as good as you can get it I mean my husband's wonderful I have comfy comfy bed and chair and clean clothes and I don't have to worry I mean I'm not working but I have PTO and you know so I have a lot to be thankful for could be a lot worse but I'm just worn down I think one of the things that one of the also things that was terrible today I had to just like the worse pain and like my butt on either side I felt like I had a pressure areas on my ischial tuberosities I was like laying in bed on my side and I just felt like there was an anvil digging in on either side in my butt I do not know what that was from I so I laid I could not get comfortable in any position so one o'clock I took my first dose of Tylenol which is the first Tylenol I've taken since since I've been ill thank god it worked maybe tomorrow will be the day my fever breaks this afternoon when I took a nap I just you know woke up just all I'm like a sweaty mess so I don't know hoping something will break this fever cycle I was hoping to brighter days tomorrow this is um day nine for me I didn't I didn't vlog yesterday so day eight I felt their letter really felt like I was going to die I just kept telling Jeff something's wrong and something is really wrong and I just felt super if it was possible to feel weaker I felt weaker like I just felt like my I had no blood pressure or like I couldn't even hardly walk I did end up going to the ER they treated me really well there ran all kinds of you know labs the thing that I had a CT of my chest and it showed so for Koba 19 to home one of the hallmarks of it is this a ground-glass infiltrates in your lungs so I have that I have ground-glass infiltrates infiltrates in my bilateral or lungs I mean I'm sure my swab will be positive but that is another positive and then dr. had to notify the State Department of Health so and doctor was really nice he said my labs were mostly good he said you're obviously doing a good job eating and drinking I said yeah I mean Jeff has just been forcing me even doing I have not wanted to do I don't want to eat or drink anything and she said she would admit me but she would let me decide so since my electrolytes were all pretty good and she said this might be you might have a few more you might have another five days of this I can't even imagine so came home last night today my temperatures still 100 points something but I think I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think I feel better I know I feel better today than I did I've been drinking Carnation Instant Breakfast s-- and today when Jeff asked me what I wanted for dinner I said baked spaghetti I've never never wanted to have baked spaghetti ever but he went and got it for me and I ate like half of it which is like a lot for me and actually tasted good hopefully tomorrow some point it has to be done checking with you later so on day ten my fever it stopped so it today's day thirteen I haven't had a fever since day ten and I'm definitely better the first day I like oh give me food I want to eat and then yesterday I just felt like I had a pretty big relapse I didn't want to eat anything nothing tasted good my whole body hurt I couldn't even last night I couldn't even fall asleep I had to get up and take some Tylenol cuz just my hips hurt my little back hurt so today was a better day I actually cleaned my room today clean my bathroom I mean that's the most activity I've done since I was ill I'm thankful that I had the energy to do that actually a work called and said since I would be 72 hours fever free I can come back to work I'm like I don't think you understand what happened to me I had a fever for nine straight days I hardly ate anything lost a lot of weight I mean it's gonna take me a long time to recover so luckily my doctor called my doctor and he wrote a note saying I can go back on him April 15th so that gives me two weeks from today to recover thank goodness I think it'll just be a slow recovery I mean there's no one can't tell you sort of what the cogut 19 does to your body long term and you know what my lung function if my lungs will go back to normal eventually and not have that ground-glass infiltrates I mean I'm gonna assume I sort of dry cough will stop at some point so I mean I have a lot to be thankful for him I mean a lot of people didn't didn't make it through this so I am really thankful and I'm willing to put in there the work I need to get my strength back but thankful for all those people along that we're thinking of me and praying for me and really appreciate that it means a lot to me so stay safe everybody stay home wash your hands this is really no joke
