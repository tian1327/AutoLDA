 so it's now going on over a month of quarantine I have not left this apartment in over a month there's no end in sight basically I saw today that over 600 45,000 people worldwide have tested positive for corona virus and over 116,000 of those people are in the u.s. so now we are the leading country of coronavirus cases it appears funny because I guess some people in that building across from me know some people in this building because the other day I noticed that people are posting messages to be read across the way which is kind of funny and then we recently got another instacart order which I was very happy to see that we got all but one of our items because the way instacart works is you choose your items and then you choose the backup item in case you can't get your first choice so we got either our first choice or second choice and then one only one item I think it was beef that Danny had ordered and they didn't have his first choice or his second choice but that was the only item they weren't able to fulfilled it off fulfill at all and it was on a what day was it I think it was a Tuesday afternoon that we got our delivery so don't know when the grocery stores restock everything but we were lucky enough to get a lot of our order and it's funny because I mean we have a pretty good-sized side by side now side by side but like French door refrigerator with a pullout freezer and I mean Danny got a bunch of Pizza pizzas frozen pizzas so we couldn't fit everything that we had gotten in the Fraser's so I had to remove everything from its packaging stuff it all on there I could not fit one more thing but by the end of it and then I took pictures of all the packaging so that we wouldn't know how to cook things and then through the boxes away of course when we got the groceries in you have to disinfect everything so they came in paper bags which I assume is like cardboard which they say that coronavirus can live on up to 24 hours and then everything was either like plastic or paper which plastic I read that they can that the virus can live on for up to three days so anyway I get everything the boxes been up on the counters because it's quite a process because first you have to disinfect everything so I just took Lysol wipes - everything wiped everything down and then everything I worked all the counters down that everything was sitting on it was all put away before my process like this added a new layer to it because not only do I have to disinfect it now but I have to check it all for damage I have to check it make sure that it's correct I'm checking expiration dates because I've had many times in my life where people they're still expired things left on the counter on the shelves so I'm very very quality assurance oriented when it comes to things that I'm buying that are coming into my house so that was a long process because we had actually ordered a lot and we're not hoarding things but we're just making sure that we're well stocked up because it's hard to get delivery times for a grocery delivery it's hard sometimes to have things being stocked because it might be a particular time where there's just a run on all the groceries so you have to make sure that you have things to eat basically Danya sent me an article about a amazon employee and the kent fulfillment distributed distribution center that's like I would say I don't know like 30 minutes south of Seattle who tested positive for enterovirus so supposedly there is a deep cleaning process that occurs and these fulfillment centers when they find an employee that has tested positive which is a little bit confusing just because I did find an article that talked about Amazon employees and then the testing that they are doing but I don't know if it's like all Amazon employees or if it's just certain areas within Amazon that they're testing but I did find that there I guess Amazon has so many different divisions so there's Amazon care that I think is relatively new and I read that they're delivering test kits to employees and their dependents but I don't know if that also includes warehouse workers so anyway they're supposed to be deep cleaning wherever the employee has worked you know figuring out how long they were there with their symptoms and things I mean it's to be expected I guess you know health co-workers are getting sick some of them are dying you know it's it's just infiltrated everywhere so you hope that that employee didn't package up your package because I know right now at least me us here in our building the people that live here and probably and the majority of Seattle probably in a lot of places across the country we are ordering things online to avoid having to go out so if it's coming to your doorstep you know you really need to be disinfecting as best you can and then earlier this week I read in a CBS article that the World Health Organization is saying that the pandemic is in the acceleration phase so what we're hearing that it's going to get worse before it gets better is very true it seems because when I started doing these videos which was a couple weeks ago a couple a few weeks ago because this is my third video there were 130,000 cases worldwide and now there's over 600 45,000 because of course it takes time to test people and confirm things and get the data out there so that's a lot of people and the numbers are just increasing and increasing and increasing I was watching Sabrina Soto who is this she used to have some shows on HDTV I think she has other businesses with in interior design and hasn't been on TV for a little while but she does have an Instagram I've been seeing her Instagram live she goes live with her interior decorating friend co-worker who is currently living with her right now in quarantine and they should talk about how she might have a couple shows in the works but she couldn't talk about them but she lives out in California and you know when they do Instagram live you can interact with them and today I actually asked a quick because she doesn't have a ton of people like I think any given time no more than 100 people watching her Instagram live at it you know so if you comment it's pretty good chance that she'll be able to ask your question and today she's talked about her favorite show his Golden Girls and I posted watch who's who's which golden girl are you and I think she said she was a combination of Dorothy and Sophia and her friend said that she was a combination of rose and Blanche and then I feel like I'm a Dorothy maybe a combination of Dorothy and Blanche there are my two favorite golden girls and that was really cool that she answered my question but by that time there was only like 40 or less people on her Instagram live which I love that that there's it's a word approachable when I'm looking for or just like accessible because of course you know these people that have much larger followings are a lot more people and Instagram live video is watching at one time you feel like you're just in a sea of people and you're never going to be seen so that was really cool but anyway I bring that up because two reasons one one was really cute she said her dad sent her a paintball mask thinking that it was protection and it does nothing and so she was wearing it in one of her Instagram live videos which was pretty funny she's a really good sense of humor but in another video or might have been the same video she was saying that they expected that California would be under you know quarantine rules for a couple more weeks and so she was like yeah okay like I can live with my friend for a couple more weeks and then somebody commented we heard it was a couple more months and she was just shocked and horrified and I'm like how do you look at the state of things with how massive they are and think that you're only going to be need to be self quarantine for two more weeks is that realistic I mean I'm thinking this could last the rest of the year or at least to several more months I mean this doesn't look like it's slowing down as I said World Health Organization is saying that it's in the acceleration phase this is gonna go on for the majority of the year from what I can see I saw a Washington Post article that really described in detail about how a virus acts and what they're learning about how this virus is acting and I want to pull up the articles because I don't want to forget the important points are the interesting points that I saw some of the things I knew a little bit about but this was a good refresher on how it behaves what it actually is so the title of the Washington Post article is the corona virus isn't alive that's why it's so hard to kill mm-hmm oh I just have some highlighted points so that I'm not here forever because I my husband is currently hiding out in the bedroom so that I can have some privacy to film this videos so in this article they're calling it SARS - CoV - - SARS Cove - - because it is related to SARS says that it typically degrades in minutes or a few hours outside of a host but some particles can remain viable and that's where they say that it can survive on I say survive I can last or still be viable up to 24 hours on cardboard and then on plastic and stainless steel for up to three days and then I found in 2014 they found a virus that was frozen and permafrost for 30,000 years that they were able to infect an amoeba after being revived in the lab so let me just back up because there's some other stuff before in this article so basically a virus it doesn't have a metabolism it doesn't need to eat kind of activates whenever enters a host the virus functions through us so it has no cellular mystery machinery of its own and they become intertwined with ourselves and their weaknesses are our weaknesses because they're so intertwined within us so this says that drugs that might hurt them could hurt us too so the the vaccines that they come up with have to be targeted targeted and specific cific so that it is effective and then viruses can evolve very quickly and because of that a vaccine that they could come up with say today might be different next week or next month or next year because they're always changing so the vaccines have to change as well to be effective so the article also says that the virus itself is working in our favor in that it doesn't want to kill us because as I said before it activates when it's inside of a body so the longer that you can be alive the longer it can thrive and it's saying that the ultimate goal of the virus is to be contagious so it while also being gentle on the host again so that it isn't doesn't want to burn out and kill everybody quickly because then what would the benefit be of that if there was nobody left to infect it can't go on and so this is this says that it's why highly lethal viruses like SARS and Ebola burn themselves out because they didn't leave anybody alive to spread them and they gave an example of oral herpes which fun fact not so fun fact I actually and one of the majority of people I think I think the majority people do get cold sores I get cold sores I tend to get them like on the right side of my face on my lip above my lip and then sometimes creeps its way into my nose but I'm saying this to help anybody out there that gets them and doesn't know that there is medication prescription medication that you can take because I used to treat them as they came with like the messy creams and it just made it look worse and when you mess with it it can spread and get bigger so a co-worker of mine once told me that he took something called acyclovir or it has another name I think acyclovir might be as generic name but it is a oral medication that you take every day to prevent the outbreaks so I've been taking mine since 2013 and I have not had a single cold sore on my face since then so it is very effective so try and help you out up there if you have cold sores ask your doctor about acyclovir because I'm telling you it changes your life anyway about oral herpes this says that it's been with the human lineage for six million years so that as a successful virus and and so right now the corona virus kovat 19 is and it's it's replicating destructively and that's why so many people are dying and then this says that one day in the not so distant future it'll be like just another one of the handful of common cold corona viruses apparently the common cold is the corona virus that's circulate every year and so that kind of reminds me of the beginning of all this when people were saying oh it's it's nothing worse than the cold or the flu well when it's new like this and it hasn't adapted to that level its destructive right now but as there are virus as there are more vaccines and as the virus learns and adapts it will one day be less lethal but right now because it's so new it's a little baby and it's just it's just causing havoc everywhere it's a guardian article that talked about I think was it was it Italy you see the headline says Spanish minister says older people found dead and abandoned that is so sad and then later in the article talks about how you know if you're found to have done this in your line of duties that you will be punished within the full extent of law so people are just abandoning these people and they're either found abandoned and maybe can be saved or they're found dead and can you imagine being abandoned and then people around you just being with dead people because you were abandoned I mean that is just horrifying to me to anybody I mean so much depressing news when I started reading about the record cases of the corona virus in New York I almost spiraled when you're cooped up in your apartment you read the news you know how bad it is but you're still in your apartment and you're separated from it which you should be that's what everybody should be doing right now but I have asthma and I've had asthma since I was a little kid and so if I were to get this it could be potentially fatal for me because in New York they're talking about how they're starting to have to do experimental procedures on these respirators to split them between patients because they don't have enough so if you were to get the corona virus and go to the hospital there might not be enough staff staff is getting sick there might not be enough fennel ears if you have to go in a ventilator and then what do you do you can't breathe you die and that's horrifying I have an almost eight month old baby and I'm just horrified of her getting a regular cold or flu you know as a new parent you're just terrified of everything and that would be horrific if she were to get that so I almost had a little panic jack probably everybody has had a moment where they were like  this  is real it's getting serious oh my god what if I got it what's the family member got it what would we do and then you see the state of things and you're like oh my god I might not even be able to get help and so you try and calm yourself because panicking doesn't really do anything but I pause because like there were just no words basically to the extent of everything and how things don't really seem to be getting better any time soon like the other day so in my bedroom we now have these mesh side rails for our bed and I used to like we have a TV in our budget and a proper TV in her living room but we I was just using my Mac I have a large Mac computer screen as a TV basically but now these mesh bed rails have obscured that vision my view and my baby she's happiest for longest when she's just crawling around our king-size bed so I'm like look I'm in this bed for hours particularly during the week when my husband works and I'm in bed with her to keep her happy because not only is she happiest when she's in the bed but she's happiest when you're near her because if you leave she screams can't have that so now I'm we basically go in shifts basically being by her side constantly and I'm like look I'm in this bed I need a TV that I can see so we ordered a TV Alfa Best Buy well Best Buy now has a policy that they will not step foot into your house building what have you and so I'm like alright Danny came down there with me because there was a delivery window the first one we missed because I wasn't aware of all this I just thought that they would bring it in put in the package room day and I would go downstairs and get it so we went down there during the second delivery window and it was between 12:00 and 6:00 well they came around like just before 1:00 and my husband had a conference call at 1:00 they had to be on we run down there in hopes that we can get it there they said they're gonna be here they said they're gonna be here we still don't see them we still don't see them I'm like Danny run up take the baby put her in her crib get on your call I will handle this hopefully the concierge will help me at least bring it into the package locker room I have this cart thinking that it's gonna fit on there but we got a 65-inch because I had I wanted to have a movie theater in my bedroom and I'm like this shit's not gonna fit on the cart and then I'm like I need somebody to come help me bring it in here poor concierge is in like a mask and gloves because it's girlfriends Auto has like an autoimmune issue and kind of find out there's like actual places on either side of the box that you can put your hand - I could have basically just drug it in by myself but he help me carry it up and it wasn't super heavy but it looked huge and the best by people by the way they didn't stick around they basically just left my TV out in the front my building and didn't even have me sign for it basically I could have been anybody be able to get it up and then I took a bunch of Clorox wipes wiped it all down what was my point in talking about this oh yeah okay it came back to me being downstairs even just being in the lobby of my own apartment building I felt like a cockroach that needed to run back into its hole I just felt so exposed and just like because you could kind of feel the fear around you and there are plenty of people you know entering and the building take it take out to go with jobs to go walks to walk the dogs whatever and you know you feel like you're safe in the apartment relatively even though you do have packages coming in and out to keep you from having to go out but it was I just I felt I felt very vulnerable even just being out on the lobby of my apartment it was a I don't know if you call it Kiera Cairo ki ro7 which is a local news station that said that there was a USPS male worker that tested positive for corona virus and the funny part about it was I guess that the u.s. the u.s. mail has different buildings for different types of mail so they did say that it wasn't in a building where you would get like real mail it was in you know those bulk mailings that's so annoying that's a waste of paper that you get that's where they worked and I was like why is that a  so you get this mail that you hate write with a side of corona virus like you don't even want to be getting this and it's like how do you how do you like and subscribe for my how do you make it so that you don't get it it's just like this this this meal that you don't want and so it's just like wouldn't that be a  if you got corona virus from this  mail that everybody hates then there was I guess the mask that people use I don't know if it's a ticket I haven't done research in the particular high-mass you need to wear but apparently they're called in ninety-five masks and there was a New York Times article blasting a Seattle target for selling them in their stores when there is a shortage within the healthcare industry and target call did an oversight and made sure that those masks got to the healthcare industry where they're sorely needed there's another New York Times article that talked about a murder like how they're they're letting out murderers and other types of criminals due to health conditions that could make them susceptible to getting the corona virus and let me find that particular article said that the guy whose name is his last name is Vincent bar SIA had a cardiovascular disease pulmonary disease and type 2 diabetes as a result of his medical conditions and age he was at high risk for civility severe illness or death if he came back if he contracted kovat 19 the Legal Aid Society which represents indigent clients argued that confinement of elderly and sickly inmates during a pandemic violates their constitutional rights 103 inmates at city jails have tested positive for chronic virus they plan to release 375 inmates this week and then it says that Judge Dwyer felt that a jury should decide on the defendants fate not a virus well think that they present a clear clear threat to the public I guess because of their age and their health status I don't know where they're releasing them to I don't know if they're just like letting them out or like if they're moving then somewhere that's more secure I don't know that the articles said so yeah I understand like even though they're the scum of the earth and this guy stabbed two girlfriends when he stabbed to death in front of bystanders and it was all caught on a video and when they caught him he said something like is she dead I hope so so yeah it's gone with her piece of  but even so when they're housed they still have rights and you have to do the right thing but I hope that they didn't just release him like out the front door like here you go I'm hoping that they just moved them to a place where they can be better protected even though they don't observe to be still cruise ships that are in quarantine and having people die on board which was pretty scary and then yeah like I said that there's a division I'm just going down the list like every time I see an article something that's interesting I put it into a note so like throughout the week it's just kind of an order as I find things so I did find more information on a geek wire article that was an update about the first woman in Seattle to receive the vaccine amongst other tech people who are volunteering through name is Jennifer Haller and she's a veteran of the late Microsoft co-founder veteran of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Strato launch space venture she was the Operations Manager for at only a Seattle startup that uses machine learning to help debt collection agencies improve their recovery strategies she said she's doing great her arm is sore at all and it's even better than a flu shot she feels lucky to be in a position where she can contribute to containing the outbreak she's a healthy at the age of 43 has a state has a stable salary position and lets her work at home her children are aged 13 and 16 and can care for themselves her duties as a study participant don't go much further and then monitoring her vital signs keeping a daily journal and checking in with Kaiser Permanente for a second shot and a few blood draws so that kind of answers the question that I had in my last video of like how old are your kids oh my gosh why would a mother volunteer for something like this well she has the means kids are older she's healthy she wants to do something good so it all makes sense but there was a Newton's article talking about individual Seattle coronavirus impact stories some of them that I found interesting were well they were just talking about how momentous this time in history is so this guy who is a psychologist who also runs with his wife a wedding venue on their farm in San Juan Island said in 10 years 20 years 30 years we will be asking each other what did you do during the coronavirus and how did you respond another person was talking about how you know years and years decades from now they're gonna be talking about this time in history and studying it and it's gonna be taught in classes and people are gonna be like again talking about you know where were you when the coronavirus was going on and what was your experience which is another reason why I think it's pretty cool to do these videos because it's kind of like a time capsule mental health professionals in Seattle have been overwhelmed Julia hit she was a psychologist and founder of Seattle clinic it's talking about how she's seeing patients back to back college students who are disoriented and depressed after their semesters have been canceled she was doing video conferencing and working out of a spare bedroom that she and her husband share and a makeshift office big part of our practice is working with patients who are obsessive-compulsive who have obsessive compulsive disorder specifically about the rich realistic hand-washing that they have overcome and now with all this big focus on hand-washing they feel like they're regressing and so they need help now Tom Douglas who's a really big chef around here has tons of restaurants he has had to temporarily close 12 out of his 13 restaurants and now didn't eject a little bit of humor not making light of this person's situation the homegirl has a degree in Norwegian and anthropology from the University of Washington and you know what job she has she's the bartender no shade of bartenders it is a job legitimate is anybody else but bless you what did you think you were going to do with norwich an anthropology degree just a little bit of humor go to school for whatever you want to I went to school for legal studies I would say how mom I'm not doing  with it so you know but still my opinion go to school for something that you can get a job in I don't know I mean school costs a lot in time and money so I digress it's 27 and she said that her greatest panic came when she wondered if she'd be able to care for her cats and she says I don't care if I have to go without coffee or food or sell my couch but if I had to give away my animals they're all I have which is really really sad I mean despite my previous comment about her degree choice you know you feel for people on a human level when they have to decide between do I eat or do as my cat eat and I don't want to get rid of them because they're like my children which I completely understand because I have two cats and they are like my kids and of course these videos won't be complete without stupid  celebrities are saying so Jaime King who was a model slash actress I think the last thing she was on that I'm aware of was a  some show with Richard Wilson that I like Heart of Dixie that I watched for like a hot minute and I just was like I'm not my style she was thinking the virus and I kind of understand her sentiment I think I understand where she was going there but she just really took a little bit too far basically and this is kind of a sentiment that's been echoed by some other people as well maybe not quite in the same way but something that is happening right now with people having to stay home as it is making you refocus do things you haven't been able do in a long time spend the time with your family that maybe you don't get as much of or you know as you would like so it is having people understand going without who may have never gone without before you know you can't find supplies you can't find food always so it does make you rethink things and appreciate things more but she took a little too far and almost being happy and thankful that it has happened and I don't think that any of us are thankful that this is happening right now Madonna who posted a very bizarre video that I recently watched I watched it today where she's in a bathtub a bubble bath full of like roses and bath bombs calling it the great equalizer and you know talking about what's great about it is also what's bad about it or you know it it puts us all on the same level and people are like bless you but people who are poor are suffering the most and dying you know celebrities are definitely very much out of touch and I mean I think that we all have a perspective that is our own and if you are lucky enough to have everything that you need you're not going to be suffering with like this at the same way that maybe a single mom would suffer or somebody who's lost their job or being laid off is suffering or we all have our different struggles and and you don't necessarily need to compare one or the other but I think that celebrities money and celebrity can get you a lot and they are not on the same level as an average person I've access is the same things you're not able to provide for yourself in the same way we're not all in the same level of quarantine of like comfortable you know basically so I think that with celebrities not being able to work and having to be quarantine like the rest of us they are taking Instagram and they are putting the foot in their foots in their mouths their foot their foots their foots in their mouths their feet their mouths and I'm loving it I'm here for it ironically I don't know if they're still best friends they have been over the years but debi mazar who was on younger has kovat 19 so and she's been kind of posting about how she's been Prince Charles is tested positive for kovat 19 there's an actor mark bloom well I'm not as familiar with but he died from the corona virus and there is crow virus website and all the links take you to the CDC websites if you have any you know questions they should be answered there a lot of good information if you're not as familiar with what's going on if you want to catch yourself up on what is going on how to keep yourself safe what to do if you think you have kernel virus that's a good resource alright so I think that that is everything if I have forgotten anything I'll just insert the screenshots at the end of the video along with any of the great memes that I've come across with during the week if you come across this if you like the video leave a like subscribe if you want to see more videos watch some of the videos that I've already done leave a comment you know about anything having to do with the corona virus where you live if people are taking it seriously where you are in the country if you're not in this country how it's affecting you leave the funniest grunt virus meme that you've come across are the most infuriating thing any personal experiences anything that you've seen in your neighborhood that you're just like what you know behavior that you can't believe that people are just flying during this time just anything that is interesting shocking what have you I will most likely be doing another coronavirus vlog next week I'm gonna try and get my act together and actually post this tomorrow if I possibly can just so that I'm up-to-date on everything I hate posting things late because with something like this where things are developing hourly by the minute you know I just don't want to be posting something that is so lay that it's like completely irrelevant basically so thanks for watching and I'll see you in my next video
