 I was expecting it to be a little bit prettier today so that's really awkward  and it was at this moment that I realized that I always brush my teeth after I eat breakfast so I was pretty much brushing my teeth at that completely wrong time because I was half asleep oh my god it's 9 o'clock and my class on Zoom is starting right now okay this is the third person that I'm just like seven friends and nobody can get into this English soon call because needed meeting password and nobody has password I guess I'll just eat my breakfast because I know what I'm supposed to be doing like Google Hangouts my teacher I just Google Hangouts Google hang up Google hangout chatted lucky chair okay got the password I'm gonna join the call now oh that's super awkward that password didn't work okay my camera turned off so like so I just finished with English class I'm done like ten minutes early and then I have a ten minute break in between this class in my nice clothes my next class was just PE I don't really understand how we're doing PE yellow line because pretty much for all of our PE classes we've been doing zoom coals and I've been an online school for like three weeks frumpy classic we haven't had to do any physical activity yet so i'm elina how that's gonna work I'm like actually kind of mad I want it to tan today I don't think today's a tanning day guys the forecast played me I'm just gonna pray that the forecast is lying to me and then actually will be sunny I've gotten comments and I make my bed weird so like hopefully that's a little bit less weird for you guys I was super comfortable my bed and I realize that my class is starting right now and I just didn't realize who is gardening right now really really attendance and I am late to my team call this is really embarrassing letter to my freshman self I have a council meeting for my school about like 20 minutes and I was gonna make like instant pasta I ate the last one I am in sewing class at school and obviously I don't have the machines at school too so when I'm sewing a dress in class this is the situation right now this is like the front part so that's the top and like I have my skirt it's a struggle man enough okay let's go upstairs and let's change because we're gonna go tan I have a swimsuit on and I'm going to tan I have a yoga mat down and a towel it's pretty hot actually prizes the weather sort of cleared up I'm gonna put some sunscreen on I'm gonna lay out here for the next hour probably I do 30 minutes on the front thirty minutes on the back I got a beat even you know and this is the last 90 day for a while so we're taking advantage  I'm dressed to workout day 6 of Chloe tang I'm going to go upstairs and shower I think I might do a little bit of homework probably not  I'm all out of the shower I was gonna do a face mask but I don't think I wanna do that tonight put on some like iPads because my eye bags are killing me right now turning on all those lights literally takes me forever I'm gonna put on some yellow belly brown eye pads my under-eye circles are just like really unfortunate right now I don't really know why they're so bad because I'm like not even tired cuz I do nothing okay those actually feel really good I've had these since like August when I went to go see Billy in New York and they like still laugh at me I just don't really use them that often because I kind of just like forget that I have them yeah so he's also a Monday by the way so I have school for the next 4 days people I'm gonna be posting twice a week now because I just have so much extra time Thursday and Sunday those are gonna be my posting days okay I'm gonna weigh about like 20 minutes now actually really long maybe about 15 minutes with these arms  quick sidenote Mario Badescu dry motion it's the tempo cream that I use and everything one of my videos it's fine I don't really even know if it does anything but I feel like it does something so I use it but I actually ran out of it it's all like China and my package from Sephora with a new bottle cut lost in the mail so I've been using this instead it's this Vichy it's like an exfoliator but I basically just use it a spot treatment it's a thick so we're like clay type of consistency I think it works like a lot better I had this bottom I know a couple days ago and it was like right on my nose and then I've put this on it was gone in like two days so honestly my using that instead of Mario Badescu from now on I'm not gonna blow dry my hair because I hate blow dry my hair cuz I'm lazy you're watching this on
