and scope the area we're going to be looking at apartments hopefully they let me take my camera into the apartments so we're going to I think four or five apartments today to see what it look like secured the bag what's up YouTube family welcome back to another video let me try on some more light yeah well I guess I didn't do anything but welcome back to of my channel I am really excited well I'd be more excited if this focused on me I'm so excited you guys I just got well welcome to my new apartment in New York City it doesn't really look like much because I just moved in like yesterday so yeah I moved in let me restart I don't even know where I just lost my train of thought this is my New York City partner I'm going to show you guys a little bit of what it looks like I obviously don't have everything that a normal apartment would probably have because I just moved in a few days ago so I still have to get stuff ready like my TV still needs plugged in and I need some stuff hung up but I'm really excited I ended up getting the apartment that worked really well for what I needed it's right close to the the the subway that I need to get into work it's only like like a 30-minute commute to work which is not bad at all for New York I'm gonna be working on Broadway by yes is it 51st and Broadway I don't know it's like yeah it's on it's on Broadway so it's like right there by Times Square so it's a really cool location um yeah let me show you my apartment like I said it's not completely done yet or furnished but oh my god please let me take you to the front of the apartment okay so yeah like I said it ended up being really good for what I needed it's a leaf studio I wanted a one-bedroom because I've never had a studio before but if I wanted a studio I would have had to get farther out from the city in order to say my budget but this is this is fine it's ended up kind of being what I wouldn't anyway so you come into the apartment right here and this is what you see that's what my trash bag outfit throws no trash way but this is a closet that I've put quite a bit of stuff in already and to the right is the bathroom I still have to get this stuff clean like I said so ignore that but yeah so here's the bathroom super cute I wish I had a wide-angle lens on this camera so I could show you more but this is the kitchen area it's pretty large actually this is a full washer and dryer right there and so ya got all my kitchen stuff there and then this is what goes into the like big studio bedroom area so like I said that literally just gives me anxiety that needs cleaned up but here is my bed my mom and I made this it was for my Kia so we put it together this is my closet like I said mess still this is a little chair I have over here I need to get a dresser because there's just too much space over here once I clean this up there's like just too much space right here so I'm thinking about getting either a chair or a dresser or both to put right here and I need to get a blow-up mattress so when people come visit I can put that there and then here is my desk where I'm gonna be like doing work or eating if I want and I need to my TV's over the core I'm gonna mount it right up here on this wall I'm gonna have the maintenance guy do it for me so I don't mess it up and then my bull head is gonna go up by my bed I'll show you guys what it looks like when it's done and yeah this is like the view you can't obviously you can see me right here but um I don't know if you can actually see the scenic setting maybe if I move close enough there we go a-all right so right over there like that area that is the eye or the Eiffel Tower what the hell that is the Statue of Liberty right over there you can't see from this camera but it's actually like not far at all I have a pretty good view of it and right there is like the path which is the Jersey Transit that takes me into New York it takes me to the 33rd Street so like only a few blocks from where I actually have to be at work so I'm just gonna walk from there and yeah it's really cool it early walking distance right there down there's a Starbucks a Dunkin Donuts and a Chipotle which is literally what I need them all I need in my life yeah so it's really cool I like this a lot and I need to that's a way to get internet till this week so I can hook up the PlayStation and all that but it's really cute I like I said I really like the place it's a mess right now still but it's fun and it was a lot of work like moving is so just draining and like a lot of money I feel so broke right now because I've spent so much money on like the deposit the apartment renters insurance furniture um what else gas to get up here a car just like random stuff and it's just like I don't want to pay for this please someone help me I start tomorrow tomorrow's my first day so I'm gonna try and vlog some stuff since it's a like it's not my first day because I started during this like first my first day of work was the Super Bowl but this is like my first time like in the office actually doing work and we have some stuff to film tomorrow which will be fun so I'm gonna try and do that and yeah I'm just like mentally just like drained so guys what's a future McKinsey um happening here to talk to you so I was editing my blog and I felt like it would just make sense to split up my blog because as soon as I got to New York I would make flames a little bit um so as soon as I got to New York I was only in the office for like two days maybe and during those two days is when the whole kronite quarantine thing kind of hit where our building in New York was closed a lot of stuff started shutting down and I was working remotely so they told us to work from home so I never really specified that between the clip you just saw and when I started filming my quarantine days like my quarantine diary days so I'm gonna split those up and this first vlog is gonna be like a me moving to New York even though I was only officially in the office for two days and then the next stuff is going to be like what I've been doing during quarantine and kind of talking to you guys a little bit about how I'm staying active and whatnot so yeah that's gonna be part two this is gonna be part one I wanted to jump in here and explain that to you guys also sorry I look very not well I'm very white right now pilot seen the sound in a while it's like day eleven twelve quarantine I honestly have lost track maybe day fourteen I really don't know but yeah so part two is coming this is part one thank you guys for watching if you haven't already please subscribe to my channel like this video or comment even if you didn't like it please give me some good criticism of what you would like to see or something your videos you guys would like to see during this quarantine I'm probably gonna put like make a random workout video of like some workouts I'm doing in home or like food you can make when you're quarantined I don't know I'm actually going home to Indiana Thursday today it's Tuesday so two more days from now I'm headed home to Indiana to be with family since I can work remotely and it's just a lot better than Indiana than it is here in New Jersey there are a lot of cases of Kobin eight-teen here and I'd rather not be stuck here worst case scenario so heading home in two days thank you guys love you guys see you soon be safe
