 hey welcome back to the hu1 log in today sadly is my last day in Seattle don't have a ton plan for today really just gonna go and check out the new Amazon spheres they're really cool I think I showed it to you in a prior video what they are here's some pictures of what they are oh yeah I'm gonna go there today's to kind of check it out whether it's like Seattle Lee Rainie slash not rainy so I don't should be fine yeah then after that really no plan might grab lunch and then just kind of head to the airport because I got a flight to catch well yeah so see you guys at the spheres but and I'm here at the spheres here's the spheres and today I'm actually gonna go in them okay I'm getting all my things I don't look like a tourist at all and I'm at the Spears we're inside the Spears it's like a big greenhouse of plants we're not allowed to touch the plants they don't let us touch the plants or apparently climb our sand on rocks that's pretty cool it's got like a lot of stuff here I mean it's really pretty that's one thing for sure it's really nice it's apparently their four levels build by Jeff Bezos himself with his bare hands it's made of the tip since I put paper mache material first support made steel made of steel and glass but it's pretty cool so you got a coffee bar up here and like a lounge area so this is for Amazon employees only you know an employee they can get access for you know guests so that's why I have a guest badge so my buddy works here but it's pretty cool so if you have an opportunity to try to come out I'll give you know someone or said I'm azan I definitely recommend it but like I said you can't just walk up and get in so it's not like a tourist attraction but it's a tourist attraction in terms of you can go outside and take a picture with it yeah so I got a little cocky for some food and like you know they got tables and subsidy kind of like sit here and work if you needed to which is pretty nice yeah it's definitely centered more towards like like sitting hearing like a co-working space but friend was unemployed plantain little glass cases  believe these are from the Jurassic period they got a little treehouse up there that's kind of cool definitely I'm trying to get up at that tree house before the end of the day look there's more stage we can go up so it's four stories but it's kind of cool because it's really like widely built but there's kind of only one set of stairs that go up which is interesting this is the third floor and it's super nice a lot of natural light do you think it doesn't get super high here because I can only imagine this would be like super warm all right now we're gonna go more place I don't take my jacket off because it's super hot and humid in here so one thing I learned is this is the second largest living wall because of all the plants so both Dan and goes all the way up to there so that's pretty impressive it's a pretty big wall so now we're heading up to the fourth floor which is the highest floor here a lot of stairs do not expect to exercise so it's pretty good pretty nice I really like the aesthetic of everything like white like the nice looking picture opportunity definitely gonna get a edgy picture here with the spheres there's more greenery more cool stuff we've got a lot of like plants here on that living wall which is kind of nice it definitely goes like all the way up I'm not a hundred percent sure how tall this place is we're really nice they have their own actual like nurse gardener for this area so she's like actually in charge of all the plants so they that's how committed they are to this like he's planting like them being here Vanessa you're gonna be in my youtube video all right so that basically concludes my tour of the spheres and I'm not calling the morgues anymore now we're just gonna find maybe lunch kind of chill out and I'm gonna head to the airport that's kind of it not too much today since it's my last day I gotta catch a flight but yeah I'll definitely if you guys update on what else I'm doing see you guys at lunch okay so just kind of hit a little shopping walking around nothing too exciting so I sent out the blog in you that I'm basically having my last lunch here really cookie butter shake and we're at Shake Shack so you know they say burger fries we're about to destroy this and then probably head over to the airport oh my gosh Anakin Loki already kind of getting down at that time getting opportunity check out the American Express lounge ye all right so before I get to stand turn on a big shout out to my buddy Alf named for a kind of Sigma Ron ashram around Seattle we did come back here to the Amazon spheres not going not Ward's spheres cuz I actually had my bag here so they're holding it but yeah just want to say goodbye I'm definitely gonna do maybe something small at this cherien lounge not a hundred percent sure about that thanks for watching another each one of ours would like the video
