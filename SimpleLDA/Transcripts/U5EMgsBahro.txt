 hey guys good morning welcome back to my channel a new blog so I know I haven't walked in a while so I wanted to just pick up my camera and talk today is what days today's Tuesday May 19 and I'm currently about to head out to work our country or at least state of New York is still on lockdown a lot of businesses are still closed we were supposed to open May 15 the but it was extended to June 13th I believe I'm not the local news source to listen to whatever I have to say but come on we all saw this coming we all know that as soon as things open people are not gonna listen and the second wave of coal bit is going a hit so you know what I will take this as a blessing because I'd rather have people be healthy and surviving and then be out partying and having a hot girl summer anyways that's sort of off topic but I'm on the way to work if I haven't mentioned this before I am an essential employee I'm a bank employee still going to work I feel blessed I still have a job so I'm not going and yeah so I was just gonna block this week so I'm about to head out to work and go surprised I don't know if you guys want to see my outfit it's really basic swine does a black pencil skirt with this cardigan it is getting a lot hotter I have to clean my mirror Wow but it's getting a lot hotter which I love and yeah so we're back to shaving the legs and back to wearing skirts to work so I'm very excited I never have time to actually eat a breakfast for work so I usually just eat one whole avocado with what summer green tea yeah music Don swine will get copyrighted but there are barely any cars ever on the street so just been driving every day that was fast ok the drinks are you thank you I'm currently on my lunch break it's actually been slightly busy day um due to colvett we all have to wear masks at work and gloves oh it's so hard to talk to clients and customers like that for example we have to have them sit at a different desk while we call them at that desk and help them it's just so complicated I'm honestly so exhausted but I'm at lunch now I've been appointment in 45 minutes so I've sucks because we're supposed to get an hour lunch i lunch right here we got some Jose Toros I also got some chips and guac probably won't eat the whole thing because this is a lot but I'm just gonna watch some ozark hey guys what's up so it is currently 8 p.m. I came back from work around 6:00 I actually and work at 4 but we work in the city so it takes a while to come back the grabbed a Starbucks drink again and drove around for a little bit just to get some fresh air brettly is 8 o'clock I just ran my bath I'm about to take it back because I'm having like horrible allergies and whatever and I've been drinking so much water under my wine glass so I don't know I'm hoping I'm not getting sick but I think it's just allergies um I'm about to take a bath and I ordered Chipotle for dinner which I'm very excited about that you tacos so I'm gonna eat that while I watch Ozark and yeah so that's basically my date today nothing too crazy um I guess a little update on my state of mind right now um is I'm feeling good it is getting warmer and I you know I wish I could spend it I'm doing summer summery things going out with my friends going to pools going to clubs whatever whatever it is that were usually doing this time of the year but it's also I'm grateful that everyone I know is healthy everyone I know and love hasn't been severely affected by what's going on I know a lot of people that lost their jobs but I do think that the government is doing a good job of the pandemic relief and people giving people unemployment funds that's a good thing it does suck though that I have to go to work what I'm not complaining I'm still thankful that I have a job because I know it's gonna be difficult to find a job once this is all over and my heart specifically goes out to those college graduates who are looking for a job in this uncertain time that we're in right now you know this economy that we're in right now which is not very I can only imagine how stressful it is for new graduates to think about what their futures gonna look like but all I'm gonna say is gonna get better we will become stronger we will get out of this stronger and at least that's what I'm hoping I'm hoping that's not the end of the world well yeah I'm going to go take my bath and I will be right back we might Chipotle gets here and yeah so let me stop talking on because I think my bathtub is gonna overflow hey guys I just got out of the bath so freaking relaxing you just realized that I never ordered my Chipotle because I never hit submit' workers oh I just ordered it and at this point I'm freaking starving and it's gonna come a night in tennis all right actually I don't know if you saw before I had those Torres Wow that means so much Mexican food I had Josh Torres in the afternoon but like I don't know I wasn't satisfied with the toast Torres I don't even finish her and I really was just craving Chipotle at that point so I was like okay I'm gonna get some tacos from she are you gonna focus well it's like you know what because I don't like my lunch and I barely ate it I'm gonna get myself some tacos from Chipotle which is what I did hopefully it comes quick I work tomorrow so I just want to go to sleep eat and go to sleep so unless you guys want to get there my old lady finally came through let me show you what I got let's see I got the veggie tacos I usually get three soft tacos and I like the veggie ones with wok obviously and I also got chips and guac and I have my that Basco sauce I also have a good time here because I'm some obsessed with chocolate so I'm literally don't don't mind that but I'm gonna watch Riverdale now because season four came out and I'm so excited I will see you guys tomorrow and yeah good night and I hope you guys are safe just favorite guys I'm always wearing about so you will never see me wearing makeup

a dirty house dust everywhere and just like things everywhere so I woke up I was gonna make breakfast but I thought I'm gonna clean so I just started um cleaning the living room by throwing like stuff out and I'm gonna dust it with Lysol it and try to make it as nice as possible a little bit of a backstory I recently bought so many things for my house from away fare calm I didn't do a haul but I should have but I bought a lot of things my house is really old and I don't wanna put my parents on blast but my parents don't really take care of it and I just told you rearranged this room we have in the Attic I will do a room tour soon and so I wanted to rearrange the living room so right now I'm just cleaning it and it's still not as great as I want it to be obviously we would need to hire construction workers to like tear down our floors and redo them and redo our kitchen cabinet but right now that's not happening so I'm just trying to make the best out of a sticky situation so I'm just gonna get cleaning and we'll see where the day takes me okay so this is our living room I just sweep the floor our floors are really really bad we definitely have to redo our floors we it's just not polished and just not nice um I brought this beautiful rug from Wayfarer I freaking love it I will link it down below because I think move out I want the same exact frog and I just dusted off the couch and used oxy Queens like clean the couch I also got this plant from wayfarer don't mind the mess here I'm gonna try to clean this up but I bought this plant from wayfarer I love it I really like the light in my house so I thought I wanted to like add a lot of plants and make it look really you know I don't know what the word for it is but just I love plants and I also bought this pillow from wayfarer thought this would be a nice accent for this couch we have I don't even know if it's focused but yeah don't mind that mess I just found these frames from Pottery Barn I don't even know we had them so I'm gonna print out some pictures and hang these up somehow and I'm currently trying to polish this coffee table there is mila just chillin oh also we found this painting but we found this painting somewhere and we hung it up I cleaned the mantel a little bit I still have a lot more to Queen and I just look back handle oh I also got this lamp from Wayfarer it's like a floor lamp and it looks really good at night I just love this lamp and I thought it went really well with our curtains and our furnitures so yeah this is a work in progress I wish I could show you guys it before I wish I could show you guys it before because mmm this living room it was not it so I'm gonna keep cleaning and I'll see you guys maybe when I'm eatin breakfast  you   after breakfast I just came outside sniper doing some work I do give me some videos this is my afternoon currently one o'clock I've literally been just doing all my things I have to get done and maybe I'm sitting here with me and yeah so I think I'm gonna work out and then shower hey guys so last time you saw me I was just chilling in my backyard doing some work I got Sun doing my work and now I hope so doing moving some self-care I have some whitening strips on and I'm about to actually tweeze my eyebrows after that they want to sit in my backyard in the Sun a little bit and like try to get some color even though I really already I'm tan I just want to like say okay that's what I'm doing today tonight there's a little bit of a skincare routine for my next time I just want to share that is all the products I use to moisturize my skin at night I can't really talk cuz it might need strict hold on let me show you what white light is actually okay I don't know that's focusing but these are the white strips I use these are the crest dental whitening treatment the enamel safe version and it came with 25 strips and I think I only have like three or four lab yeah that's what I have on my teeth right now and I'm just gonna get to tweezing my eyebrows alright so I use thank you see me so I use the tweezerman tweezers they're amazing they're like 20 bucks but they're really worth the price because they really grab onto each chair and just pull it out is it even hurt so I'm just gonna tweet start tweezing oh okay I'm gonna tweeze my eyebrows and then I'll get back to you guys hi guys I'm in my backyard now have some iced water and I'm just I'm just laying out trying to tan my life hydrating I still have my whitening strips on who was gonna show long hair I'm chilling in the back I told my friend called me rebel is real when your arms are lighter than their your legs so I'm trying to like tan them right now  hey guys what's up I'm home now I actually wants to urgent care today just because I thought I'm ready I've got a major infection and I wanted to check it out before I got any word and I don't have an ear infection which is great and I just ran some errands and picked up dinner and now I just seen here some of my home records I'm gonna take a shower and right after the shower I mean show you guys what skincare products I use in the show or announce at the shower and yeah so I'm gonna go ahead I'm not sure if you can really see me I don't know it seems to be a little dark hey guys so I just got out of the shower and I'm eating a sandwich that my mom made it so mm-hmm and I want to discuss the beef of my teeth so I just wanted to discuss the products that I use in the shower and then out of the shower um by the way in this whole vlog I don't think I wore makeup once so shout out to me if you're being comfortable enough it's not wear makeup hope you guys are okay with that it took me a lot of time and a lot of courage to stop wearing makeup in public I mean I barely wear makeup towards these day so I'm really proud of myself but that's because I take care of my skin and I think skincare comes before makeup 100% and I'm sure that all of you can agree with me on that it's very important to take care of your skin because if your skin is not in good shape it will show through your makeup so I wanted to show you guys a few things I do before the shower and in the shower that really really helps with my skin care so before the shower I like to use my Hollywood California glam glow super mud mask and you guys know this masks rated so high they sell out at Sephora almost everyone talks about this mask and how good it is it is a clearing treatment so as soon as you put this on you can feel your skin starting to kind of feel cleaner um really like clears up your skin and makes it brighter it takes off off all the dead skin cell I just love this mask so much it is kind of pricey but I really think it is worth the buck if I'm not using this because I'm gonna savor this as much as possible I do use my L'Oreal Paris pure clay mask and it's also a black mask not pretty guys but it's also black mask and as you can see I've used more of this just because it's more affordable but honestly the quality is almost the same I do still feel that the won the glam glow is a lot better than this but this does the same thing it really makes your skin look fresh and clean and clear just really removes all that dead skin and one thing with this mask I feel like it moisturizes my skin to with the glam glow I don't feel that but with this mask I really do feel moisturize after I use this so before the shower I either use one of these two masks then in the shower because I already have used a lot of product on my face I mentioned this before I have sensitive skin so just due to that fact I try not to use too many products and chemicals on my skin though since I already used a mask in the shower I like to use this right here there we go I like to use this in the shower this is the Vichy laboratory scored of it I don't know this is the Vichy Laboratories purity thermal three-in-one I'm pretty sure this is a French product this is the dead Malkina integrin puke it's noticeable I took French in high school but I still obviously suck at it but basically this is a one-step cleansers for sensitive skin it contains cleansing milk toner and eye makeup remover so just in case I don't get all the product with my face mask I like to use this in the shower and this as cleanser has a very minimal it does not use a lot of harsh chemicals which is exactly what I want but this has just worked wonders for me this is my third one I bought in my lifetime and it's just great for sensitive skin if you want a clean face without too many chemicals I think this is a great product disclaimer I'll have all the products listed down below ok so that's what I use in the shower besides my dove soap I don't really put anything else on my face in the shower so I am NOT the most minimal minimalist I mean I'm so minimal when it comes to skincare I don't like to put a lot of chemicals on my face so the only product I really use after the shower is my face moisturizer I've been using this product for years because my mom my whole frickin family uses this this is the ponds fragrance free cold cream deep cleanser lotion it's also makeup remover but also fun fact Kylie Jenner uses this because I've seen it in her story but it's just a very moisturizing lotion on yet so I'm gonna put it on my since I just got a shower mmm yes it's just so moisturizing and it feels so nice on the face it's a cold cream so it feels just so cold on your face and it really like locks in the moisture if you watched my recent vlogs you guys know that I went through a really weird accident where a dog bit my face and I split my chin open and due to that I have added this product to my skin care and this is also good if you have acne star scars or other scars on your face that you want to get rid of is Mederma advanced skin care for scars so basically when I get out of the shower even if I haven't showered that day I put this on my face on once a day and as you can see my dog pipe light is healing pretty well it's only been um and that and my friends dog Picasso really like got deep in there so considering that it's healing really well and I also put it on my chin lit all right guys I just wanted to show you what I use in and out of the shower I want to do a full skincare routine video another day but I just want to be honest I don't use that many products I don't want to falsely advertise so many products that I use when I really don't I think what really helps you with my skin is I try not to put too much on it but I will do another video separately I am gonna close out this vlog um I hope you guys enjoyed this vlog just a little follow me around Dayna life of an essential worker not really and coronavirus times but if you guys
