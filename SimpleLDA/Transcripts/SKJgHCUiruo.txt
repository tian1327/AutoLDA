 so hello guys and welcome back to another video I have decided to just make youtube videos just because I feel like it it's not for any particular reason or what-have-you anyways is the fan bothering one second okay anyways I'm back sorry I had the fan on on the stove because I actually just made some soup and yeah so like I was saying I have decided to just start making YouTube videos again just for fun nothing crazy like no high expectations and I wanted to do a vlog here in Atlanta because I'm in Atlanta Georgia and I have some friends that are here I'm actually staying in downtown Atlanta in the city and they're like just outside of Atlanta they're literally like a 15 minute drive for me but um yeah Atlanta is really beautiful there's a lot of things to see even though a lot of the shops are closed restaurants are closed well not closed they're really only doing takeout but yeah so I thought you know for my sake to have like a video diary for memories and then also for people who are interested in coming to Atlanta Georgia and just wanted to see what Georgia was like or who just like to watch vlogs or travel vlogs whatever happened I did not blog the airport because it's just not really a safe time to I was mainly focused on my safety and not really touching things too much so I didn't want to constantly whip out my phone and whatever um but yeah I say um a lot sorry guys does it again but yeah I am going to be doing a hotel room tour in this vlog because I'm on a corner property or a corner unit rather in the hotel that I'm staying in and it's just really dope the views are amazing you could literally see like the city of Atlanta well downtown Atlanta and I think you guys would enjoy that sorry please don't mind the noise that's actually the Martha Martha train I don't know it's it's kind of like San Francisco's train trolley whatever that like the rail on the street too and it just goes through the city anyways I'm trying so yeah at some point you will be getting a room tour in this vlog we're gonna do sightseeing and me and my friends are gonna take a day trip to go see Tennessee just because you know why not we're gonna rent a car and drive out there it's only a three-hour and something drive from where we are in Atlanta so yeah that will be exciting too and I'm definitely gonna vlog that and show you guys Tennessee um and we're planning on getting some bomb BBQ food because obviously the southern countries are known for that con southern states are known for that um but yeah so I don't know when I will pick up this vlog next but I'll see you in my next recording whatever that might be so I realized I was covering the mic when I originally recorded this but this is just the soup I'm eating and I'm watching married at first sight which is on Netflix or at least season 9 is and it's a pretty good show where people literally get married at first sight and try and make a marriage work I definitely recommend you watching it like I said it's on flicks so my friends are coming over again later but they need me to run to the store to grab something for later on tonight and I'm gonna take this opportunity to show you guys a little bit of downtown Atlanta and some views from my window which I'm also going to show in the room tour but I'm just gonna throw it in and it's gonna be like a little montage but yeah I'm going to this cool smoke shop that offers hookah products marijuana products tobacco everything good everything you can think of like vape and but they also have this cool like crystal like sage kind of like you know spiritual vibe part of the shop which I'm going to show you guys and I'm going to be picking up some crystals which I don't believe in the powers of crystals I just think it's fun a fun thing but crystals cannot change your life that is just my opinion but I think they're fun and cool to have so yeah I'm just going to show     here is a clip of me the very next day super hungover and I needed a coffee first period Oh so hello guys so like you just saw in that little clip that I just put in the video I did drink a little bit too much last night I had a few glasses of wine and a little bit of Bacardi and I can't Hank like I I just can't hang in general like I can't win with whatever I do it is what it is I've learned to accept it but um I just wanted to show you guys the crystals that I got from the smoke shop that you saw in the little montage that I made so this one is rhyolite which is supposed to have properties or I don't know I don't know how to describe it like the energy of self-worth self-love like self-acceptance all of that jazz and this is a rough one so it's not like shined or anything it's like literally rock and then I got a good old rose quartz I hope you could see it I don't know if it's gonna pick up but yeah rose quartz is for love trust and everything having to do with that like your love life so they say you're supposed to sleep with this under your pillow and that's gonna help bring love into your life but I'm not doing that because like I said I'm a good Christian I don't believe in crystals I believe in Jesus but I think it's just fun that you know a rock has a symbol and just it's just cute so yeah those were the two that I picked up from that smoked shop but yeah guys so I'm gonna go make some breakfast I'll show you what I make so let's get - cooking cuz I am starving so let's go so nothing crazy I just have some boiled eggs going I don't know why it's making that noise to be honest and I'm gonna have some wheat toast with cream cheese don't mind the dishes like I said I'm in Atlanta for a week it is what it is there's gonna be dishes and I'm gonna make a little iced coffee and I'm gonna show you guys when I get all this together okay guys and this is it like I said nothing fancy there's only so much you could do when you're living out of a hotel but yeah I got my both eggs my wheat toast cream cheese and then I'm also going to probably have maybe one or two of these Babita breakfast breakfast biscuits and these are also good for cream cheese but I'm not gonna eat the whole pack because that's like too much calories going on and I always have water to chase with my coffee so I don't dehydrate I'm also watching YouTube this is a youtuber named Greta and I don't want to put your last name so I'm not gonna say but she's the actress actually from the CW show all-american and her and Jordan both have YouTube channels that they post on and I've just been watching it they're actually really interesting wow that sounded like a backhanded compliment anyways any meeting like that but yeah well I mean so I just did my hair Wow that's on camera if you know you know I'm not gonna say it I'm not gonna say it but if you know you know but anyways I'm gonna run downstairs to the lobby because my headache is literally banging and I just wanted to do my hair cuz I don't really like to go out in public too too much with that bun I don't know I just prefer my hair done so anyways that's what I'm about to do success major Keys period poo get into it so just wanted to give you guys a bit of an update I am just drinking some tea right now but my friends are on the way they are going to be staying over again and hopefully I will feel comfortable enough to record with them I think I'm just gonna tell them like

gonna take a day while I'm here in Atlanta to drive up and we're not gonna get into anything too crazy because of course we don't want to go into crowded places or anything like that so you'll just see what we get into     Sunshine's    95 bottles of beer on the wall 99 bottles of beer and over 95 bottles of beer take one down pass it around 94 bottles of beer on the wall 94 bottles of beer on

friends left to where they're staying and then I just took a shower brush my teeth had a little snack and I was out yeah we were pretty tired from our trip all of us especially my friend because he did the majority of the driving but um anyways I'm not too sure what I'm gonna get into today it should be a pretty chill day obviously whatever I do I'm gonna show y'all what I do but I know my friends are coming back over later and I just wanted to show you guys breakfast I have some boiled eggs here getting my protein in or whatever and then and then I have oatmeal and I mixed two of like the Quaker Oats packages so this one is maple and brown sugar and then cinnamon and spice so it literally smells like pumpkin pie and I hope that's what it tastes like and then I have my Dunkin Donuts ice caught in my water of course because you got to always have these two together okay remember I said that so with breakfast I'm just watching the Great British baking show and I love baking shoulders like I could walk okay so quick update this oatmeal is absolutely disgusting so don't do what I do I'm still eat it because protein and nutrition but it does not taste good so I thought I'd just show you guys what I'm wearing just in case you're interested really casual outfit nothing crazy top and bottom is literally hmm and then I have my supreme bag which went everywhere with me this trip tentative 10 recommend but the thing about buying into supreme is that sometimes you have to be willing to spend like double and even triple the price but it is what it is and then I have on my fila distributors shoes I think it's distributors but yeah nothing crazy cash I just wanted to let you guys know I am about to step out to get another coffee because that Dunkin Donuts coffee was not strong at all and I'm like starting to feel it like my body needs caffeine and good caffeine so I got my coffee and decided to go for a walk and I just wanted to share with you guys that if you ever need to do anything for yourself for your mental health physical health anything like that just go ahead and do it life is too short to be stressed and to worry so do what makes you happy and for me that's honestly traveling and being with friends so my Atlanta trip has officially come to an end and I just spent the entire morning cleaning up the hotel room you know getting my things together and then I did make a little bit breakfast which I will be showing you guys sorry the Sun is like glaring sorry guys somebody knocked on the door but like I was saying what I did this morning and I do have a couple of hours left here in Atlanta because my flight isn't until 6 o'clock and I do have an overnight layover in Charlotte so I will be spending the night there but um yeah so I don't know if the vlog is gonna end here or in Charlotte but I did want to show you guys the room that I've been staying in for a week and then I will show you my breakfast that I made today so let's get into it so

left that I want to give to the homeless but low key I'm scared I'm not are you but we will see and then I just left a little low note for the cleaning service because I just want them to know that their work is valued and then I have the dishwasher going because I hate to leave dirty dishes in a hotel room it's just a pet peeve I actually like really clean before you guys never forget to sign
