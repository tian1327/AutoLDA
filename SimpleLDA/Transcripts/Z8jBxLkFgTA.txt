  so I'm gonna try to do a little quarantine vlog right now I'm about to go to the post office I got a drop off in order for my Poshmark store so that's cool and I don't have anything that will fit the bag so we're gonna go inside I'm going to the post office that I like because there's parking you already know I get down if it's a  lot I'm there it's not a parking lot I will find another location so not much going on I just need to get outside and I'm just taking this opportunity get some air and you know it's 12:39 and yeah how are y'all doing during this quarantine how do y'all feel I hope that everybody staying safe healthy out there stay in the saddle washing hands I hope that you sneeze inside your shirt like the elbow inside the shirt and keeping your germs to yourself and just make sure everybody else's you know so I guess I'm gonna go to Starbucks after and then I was gonna do like a little talk like a little life update I guess because yeah I know that quarantine is really changing a lot of our lives and I knew normal right now one thing that really changed for me is that see I might as well I would love to be at school right now I was doing my student teaching now they got us like everything is online I gotta do simulations with students and pretend class and all this stuff so yeah but right now this is the perfect opportunity for you to get your life together or like you know make sure you eat them right make sure you are you know getting sleep don't be out here staying up all night so that you get bags in your eyes now like summer is right around the corner and this is the time that you should be wearing your waist trainer so yeah I'm not going to the post office aw doesn't know yet we mask the other witness and I got all these masks from when I was doing eyelash and I have bookies and you know I found out that doing lashes I love to sell lashes I don't think I like to do though so and make sure when your mass is on its all correctly okay try to no gaps I mean at least they're stylish but I don't know what to say the c-word okay we're not gonna say that with my channel so yeah let's go to the post office we are out of the post office trust me I already washed well use the wet wipe or my hands I'll wipe damn a little glasses so much go to Starbucks but yeah y'all so this long is not gonna be interested at all but I guess it'll just be us talking why not but how y'all doing how's our mental health doing really like you have to I know staying inside you can literally go stir crazy cabin fever all those times but seriously y'all just try to I don't even know like cuz I don't want to give advice that I'm not taking but it just try to keep yourself busy work on your business watch my video about starting your business so you could get like a little gist of how you should get started and like go see your backyard go to your front yard like I'm gonna do yoga and I've been doing yoga pull it up pull it up on my TV and like oh come on windows a lot of fresh air in and then I stretch you know just so you can feel good you don't want your bones to get all eight get make sure your waist ring is warned y'all cuz we gotta be snatched and I definitely got cute for this video I'm gonna take some pictures but I just watch on older like you know so I was saying before I went to the post office so with school right as y'all know I'm working towards being becoming a teacher I graduate in May well they like we might have a virtual graduation kids to imagine logging or to zoom and they should graduation I I love technology but I wanna walk across stage but yeah so I'm working towards becoming a teacher and I was doing my student teaching like I think I explained this a lot of times that when I was on campus I wasn't going to class like I literally was just living there and working like going off campus and going to the elementary school and stuff know like this feeling of being a court see it makes you feel like it's easy to lose your motivation I would say because when you have to get up and get dressed and leave the house and you know alright let's check my to-do list okay like it gives you a sense of um excuse me time but gives you like a sense of importance in a sense of okay like somebody needs me I'm important part of a team you know that like it's that's kind of how it made me feel and it sucks that I don't have to do that anymore like I just I could wake up shower drink my coffee then it's like okay what are we gonna do today like of course I still have little assignments like I told are like they got us doing simulation schools and stuff and we watch in case you're watching people teach that's the assignments we get and you know I'm grateful that like look at it like this the little zoom means that I do have is just to talk to my advisor slash the chair my department and she like gets his tips we talked about my resume basically like professional training or whatever perpend for the pro life you know and um like I'm lucky that that's all I have to do and it's like our once a week but some people they were still in the middle of doing like their thesis and some people had five classes I think said one of my friends at school he was like he this is his hardest semester so I am blessed in the sense that I don't had some law go and and do client or my work about classes I took all my classes before I don't get me wrong but that was one time that was literally one at a time then another online class I took I was like reading and putting assignments you're not Antony with nobody so it just it's crazy I could not like I really my heart goes out to any of y'all who had to do all your classes online I did one at a time like that was the only class I was taking all semester so that wasn't that bad so I really and I didn't have to zoom meet with nobody was just like a right here's your assignments to the discussions and be good so like I really am sympathize for y'all and I empathize with like for your hell whatever teacher hello but like I really like don't give up y'all you are so close to the end and I know that this might be a little curve off the track but it's okay like you're gonna get through this so just just make sure you make it um nope like put stuff in your calendar and your phone cuz everybody has their phone in their hands 24/7 now you know and another thing about having your phone in your hand all the time I have to take a break from social media I got to the point it was draining me I don't know why I just feel like and like people say anything on the internet and it just started to like look like I'm so stupid maybe I got to change who I follow that's definitely one thing and I've been trying to do that I still to shave I know I tried like it's something funny and I'm bored or I'll go look at it but I don't really go to the comments and I'm just trying to I have to take a break over social media because it got too much you know so yeah so like I was saying with all my classes put something in calendar make sure you put alerts you know don't just like alright I'm gonna do that tomorrow no put it in your calendar put it at a time and say you'd be like alright work Warren this timing give yourself a nice pocket time and just zero in on that cuz got nothing else to do so just zoom in and zero man cuz don't let this let you slip off I know that my school there are letting students um you know basically petition if they would like it to be passive fail and it's so funny because my my little group of what would you call us the like we're all box me student teachers we're student teach I mean while watch me teachers we're student teaching right now we always like well we work a little hard we work too hard just for a passive thing and I agree I work there like before I had to do this all my stuff I work hard that's the teacher stuff is not a joke you know so I really miss my students and having a sense of like it's crazy how your identity is with like so embedded in I'm working this is crazy at least for me I'm just speaking for my experience so I dead messed my students and I miss seeing them and I miss them saying miss miss I miss I miss I missed it but be good I'm still gonna be a teacher y'all so keep me and y'all thought Emperor ears cuz II box of you teacher and let's go to Starbucks
