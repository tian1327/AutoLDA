 me personally I think they should lock it down they should lock it down hey good morning everyone this is Gilson Vergara doing my life I'm gonna make this short video and I'll probably be doing more videos like this is more my vlogging side where no intro no nothing you're straight to the point no fluff I hope you guys are safe and healthy out there at the present moment Corona is hitting America hard especially in New York over a hundred thousand cases and I think it's creeping up to like three thousand deaths everyone good morning it is Saturday we are going to be Jays because I got to put new tires on the Benz yeah this hook Corolla things going crazy right now seems like I'm getting fatter me too I saw I look like I'm on the weight i look skinnier every time i see this video i'm a quad your chin i sell really like this Manfrotto main tripod it's pretty cool I mean it's really you can feel the quality on this thing I did do a video but I don't know if I should buy another microphone Vic or is it the phone I don't know because all my vocals have up pops in them like you know like just Fikes up and stuff like that so I don't know I'm having second thoughts you you it's supposed to be warm today but it's pretty cold so it looks like some of these Americans have settled down it's not as frantic or panicky as it was last week the everything looks packed today just finished getting a haircut came from BJ's put the new tires on yes I'm looking at dead Tony and my barbers tell me that the government is shutting him down tomorrow so um I don't know hopefully this thing will blow over in the next couple of weeks but uh I'll keep you updated everything I'm not good news by the baccala property airport news as well to stuff lock it  good morning everybody so today is the first lockdown the governor and we fix this the governor has set putting a lockdown on all the essential workers I'm sorry all non-essential workers to stay home extermination is an essential industry so I'm going to the office I don't know how busy it's gonna be today probably not too busy what everything considering everything but um  we'll see what happens man that's pretty crazy right now pretty crazy  hey guys so they sent us home early today we we pretty much ran a skeleton crew in the office as you can see there's really nobody on the highway if you're using in New York traffic even now there's usually a lot of people but yeah I don't know how good or bad this Corona thing is gonna you know affect everything but uh good morning everybody it is I hope everything is well with everyone this whole corona thing is in New York is acting really stupid out here all I can say is I think the last time I checked think the last time I checked cases in Corona and cases of Corona in America have gone to over a hundred thousand about like almost about like almost three thousand deaths I know what Americans do right now me personally I think they should lock it down they should lock it down because it's it's getting a little bit crazy now most people still out as you can see people are still out people are still driving as you can see there's no lockdown out here and I don't know man just to update on this vlog setup I took off the microphone because for some reason I keep hearing pops I don't know if it's super sensitive or I got a deal with the equalizer on the phone if there was a eq on the phone but it sucks but yeah back to the corona thing I mean China it will allegedly up and running I know Singapore went went down for a couple of locked down for I think for a while combin down below we'll other countries locked down and the benefits they had from locking down because obviously America hasn't locked down they've done shut down for it for they've done shutdowns for four towns and every I mean for its places and things like that as you can see people are still out and about which is uh it's getting kind of sad now me personally I don't like not working or not being busy or not being able to make more money off of you know my efforts but I would prefer taking a three-week hit versus a three month or longer hit from trying to continue to maintain rather than contain this issue coming up below what you guys think because it's get a little bit crazy out here it seems like it has slowed down but people are still out you know Ruby and I we still go to BJ's because I do some shopping and stuff like that and we're pretty stocked up now so I don't be I don't think we'll be shopping for a while but people are in and out around it you know walking around like it's nothing and I understand there's panic and then there's there's the ability to just keep moving forward and not think about bad things but there has to be a point in time where you have to step back and be like is this really benefiting the community as a whole and at this present moment I don't think so and I'm not really into the government here in America but I don't know man they need to do something we need to come together with something or I know there's uh there's vaccinations out there but it's on and it's in a trial period I don't know how are your talents being effective right now at the moment with corona still busy people still driving around people still working doesn't stop it's just this is Long Island New York for you I have to say it hasn't been as busy as it as you it usually is because of the you know covert 19 but definitely not a ghost town by far not a ghost town I know already and dumaguete they're having a island-wide shut down for about three weeks where I believe from what I hear from my family only one person from that family can leave the house to really cut down everything and maybe that might be the best route for America I don't know or especially in New York is America waiting for it to hit the Midwest very hard is that what they're waiting for I don't know they're getting hit hard by it especially in New York because of the density I don't know comment down below what you guys think once again this is goes over Garrard ooh my life I'll take care god bless stay healthy and then we'll all go through this eventually but in the meantime throw me a like comment on below I really appreciate it plays with the algorithm to put it put the put the video to the top thank you take care bye I think they left the lights on yup so that's the end of my day um yeah nothing too crazy today another light day I was trying to get trying to get along with life day to day but uh yeah once again I hope everybody is very good out there healthy thriving rather than surviving even though in these times right now it's probably just survival right now but um I hope everybody's okay out there and then let me know about the type of vlogs do you want more of these so I can part what I downloaded iMovie on this phone so I'll probably chopped it up that way so it'll be a lot better you know so I'm less editing which is takes up a lot of time and saves a lot of time potentially so let me know what the audio as well cuz I'm definitely gonna check that out so once again this is ghost over dare I will see you soon stay positive stay calm keep doing your thing but uh take care guys bye
