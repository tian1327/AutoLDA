  and then when you depart I will come back to life so today is actually my birthday it's midnight so officially on my birthday and I wanted to end today or begin today with a little self-care and you know kind of like give myself a head to toe so I thought why not share my routine with you so I'd like to do this ideally I would like to do it once a week but it basically turns into once a month kind of thing which is OK with me but I do parts of it throughout the month but I like to do like you know like a deep cleaning of the house this is like a deep cleanse of yourself and just pamper yourself and a little TLC I don't know my my voice is like this we just watched a really scary movie I can't even remember what it's all but what it's called cuz it's so scary so I think we don't relax a little bit in the in the tub before going to bed I have a glass of wine with me which is a must in the tub so we're gonna start with my hair I just damp into my hair and I swear by olaplex I'm really sad because I only have a little bit left so you just but I didn't wash my hair you just use it on damp hair so there's just kind of damp in your hair and you work the number-3 really well in to your hair and older pets is the bomb if you have color treated bleached damaged hair it's a must so I work it in everywhere not just the end but even the roots because sometimes the roots and my kind of right here is where you get double process or triple processed the damage unfortunately is all around and this needs to sit for about 15 minutes that's why I like to do it now it's really expensive but it's my birthday so I'm not being stingy and I only have a little left so I'm gonna have to buy another one anyway so might as well just use all of it I must wash it in everywhere oh I already feel so good man that's like a little every time and put it top of your head and we're gonna actually let this sit while we sit in a tub so now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna hop in the shower and rinse my body and I'm gonna do a swirl in the tub scrub it in so I'm not gonna you know do anything in the shower I'm gonna be using my dove mango butter and almond butter body wash and then I'm not gonna do anything to my hair and then I'm going to use my foreo to wash my face with my favorite cleanser that kills a rare-earth deep or daily cleanser I'm going to take my scrubber and
