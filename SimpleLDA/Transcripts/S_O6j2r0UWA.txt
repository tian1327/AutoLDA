  so I just finished the Michael Jackson yoga class was really fun I'm gonna do a whole video about item not sure if it's up now or not but it's funny because I've taken yoga once before at the gym I like my local gym and I really did not enjoy it and I think it was just too much you know I had to like ease into it and this was very relaxing it was really really nice she has a great playlist and it was very relaxing Michael Jackson music you know and I really enjoyed it I have not listened to Michael's music and really focus on his voice in such a long time so that was a lot of fun yeah I'm gonna leave the information for the class down below because I think you guys might really enjoy it especially now like they were quarantine and another cool thing about this class is that we can do it as a group so if you guys want to get your Michael Jackson friends together or your internet friends I think it'd be a really great opportunity so anyway I'm gonna go and try to find something to eat cuz I'm actually getting pretty hungry and yeah I'll talk to you guys next time something important happens  Oh alright guys so I am going to be filming finally the puzzle of making video I got Greg here say hi so and he's gonna help me put together the puzzle I'm gonna show you guys if you guys did not remember her but I unboxed it a little while ago yeah we've got to get this started it's gonna be a full video of like the puzzle making but yeah I just wanted to show you guys what I'm doing today so yeah this puzzles 500 pieces 18 inches by 24 holy moly and this is dusty  all right so this is the Michael Jackson puzzle so far and it's really hard you guys it's hard cuz like bubbles is over here and it's like basically a mass of just black puzzle Michael shirt is just like red puzzle so it's tough one foot I'm done for the night did some filming for YouTube now I'm about to have my favorite chocolate this is all vegan chocolate it's really good it's like eight dollars but it's so worth it it's huge it's actually a really big bar so don't judge all right so I am making sauteing frying up ribeye all right so here is the ribeye some rice and some pinto beans which oh that's us  I love Vietnamese pho or Foe I'm not really sure to pronounce it so I got I got these rice noodles and also this pho broth and I really wanted to feel felt like having soup so I had like lift over rib eye steak from yesterday and some napa cabbage and some cilantro and the broth and some noodles so let's see how it goes are you guys so I'm working on a social project and I've been combing through these books so here I have the granny smith apples with cinnamon sugar and some lemon juice and now I'm gonna make the topping you have to cut the butter into the oats and the sugar and everything I have no idea what I'm doing but I have to go like this two hands and I have one hand right now so I'll show you what it's done are you guys the apple crisp is all done sorry already took a spoonful but it's so good so good alright you guys so yeah it's like pretty much a ghost town out here I just wanted to show you guys  whoa alright guys so I kind of look crazy but I just wanted to come and say that I'm outside for a walk right now and I'm really hungry for like some takeout I've been cooking a lot and I'm sure you guys have seen that in my past vlogs but like today I just feel like I want something outside you know cuz I haven't been eating any takeout so I am choosing between a sushi and KFC shout out to Randall haven't had KF seen a while so I think I'm gonna go with that because sushi the thing about it is like the big thing with fish that's raw you want it to be fresh and I really can't say that like this restaurants have had a lot of traffic during this pandemic I don't know what's going on so I think I'm gonna go for KFC but the thing is that I don't really want to go inside contemplated walking through the drive-through but ya know I'm gonna boss up I have a big squeeze pump hand sanitizer with me in my bag so even though I'm gonna touch the door and all that I'm going to be safe about it I'm gonna be safe about it and using a hand sanitizer before and after I go in so let's go in and just get our snack all right you guys so I'm back home I'm gonna dig into this KFC I'll show you guys what it looks like it's probably gonna be good I'm actually really hot I don't know why we're this huge fleece outside probably cause it was cloudy and I was like oh my gosh it looks like it's winter but no it's still spring weather pretty nice outside not that many people I yeah I'm just gonna have some KFC watch some YouTube I will pick up the camera win something else exciting happens I don't know what that's gonna be but life's like a box of chocolates you never know what you're gonna get next so guys know I got my favorite chicken tenders meal biscuit in here which of Matheny's I don't have 30 and fries did you guys know that KFC discontinued their potato wedges that said I think it's a travesty all right you guys so here I am nice and sweaty I just came back from the grocery store and today was actually a really good idea to go to the grocery store because to be honest there was nobody there it was nice and rainy and misty here in New York and what I went out it's not actually like pouring down rain and was more like misting so it was a really good opportunity to go out there was barely anyone in the store and I'm gonna put groceries away it's 5:15 right now I have a video premiering at 6:30 so I'm gonna go in the chat but until then I'm gonna put these groceries away grab a drink of water and poof chill out  alright guys so I got some Goya yellow rice cuz I love to cook with that some sweet Italian sausage some mushrooms um this bread is so good I hope you guys have heard of its called Dave's killer bread and it has like protein fiber Omega threes like it's pretty healthy so I love this I got some chopped broccoli some stuff for salads like romaine hearts cucumber carrots some ice cream of course non-dairy um some lettuce some orange juice just a little bit cuz you know trying to drink a lot more water but some oranges some tortillas under there that's new Cholula and yeah my table is like pretty much a mess cuz I have so much stuff on it but that's what happens during the quarantine you know you go grocery shopping you get a bunch of stuff and hopefully you use it all as you guys can see pretty much all my days are just editing eating cooking and that's pretty much it and watching some Michaels so I hope you enjoyed this vlog honestly things have been pretty much the same in monotonous um it's interesting because I every day watch Governor Cuomo who is our governor here in New York State he's like whole rundown of everything and he pretty much has it's like Groundhog's Day every day and like him saying that and then him saying that every day is like so ironic cuz it's literally the same thing that he opens within the first 5 minutes so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed a little bit of a look into my life I'll see you guys next time cuz it looks like we're gonna be here for a while bye you
