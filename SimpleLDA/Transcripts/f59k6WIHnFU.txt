put a ton of essential oil in it anyway it's what we're doing I have my W Stephens on so I can easily cover like that morning at Saturday and I have decided to make Greek yogurt bagels I've already started the process who is separated them into four and we need to roll them out this is from the skinny taste website so I'll link that below for you I'm also gonna use this is everything by gobby this is one of your seasonings and my new so parents out there called whatever baking mats because it says to use them yeah wish me luck I tried these ones a few years ago they turned out fine but I don't think I've followed the instructions well enough and this time I'm going to follow instructions and we'll see how they turn out all right they look good now in baking the gobby cookies with the Maldon sea salt on top I already have one batch in the oven and I have five more like rounds of this when the bagels are ready I'll show you how they turned out they look really good they look kind of like doughy so I think with the taste test well I'm pretty much just useless for the rest of the night I made a charcuterie board dinner and I'm watching master class which I don't know if I've mentioned I bought masterclass and it's actually really really good so we watched the negotiations one with Chris boss now I like need to read his book now Martine Bobby Brown and she's teaching
