 hello guys its future Chantelle here I debated really hard when I should upload this video because I was like of everything that's going on I don't know people want to see that they in the life of a college student but I also my decided to upload it because I do talk about the situation further in the video so I was like might as well uploaded so people don't think I'm being tone deaf as many people are but that being said rest in peace George Floyd and to the many victims of police brutality since I'm not a huge youtuber I can't say like oh I'm gonna use all my Adsense money to donate to the many places that you can donate to I have just decided to spread awareness and down inscription down below is gonna be the number that you can text floyd to and you just signed position by doing that literally takes less than five seconds no excuse for that and the other petitions you can sign and legit places that you can donate to such as black lives matter and george ford's family and though I believe it's called like bail funds for the protesters that are getting arrested just everything down in description down below and hello guys welcome back to my channel um today is another day in my life like always um it's currently I think it's like one something I literally couldn't go to sleep because my neighbors were having a party and I don't think it ended until like 5:00 in the morning I didn't fall asleep till like 6:00 so yeah I had to sleep in because I just like couldn't I don't have lecture today so today is like more kind of a chill day but I still have work to do right now I'm just gonna go make breakfast and head off to the gym and I have a couple errands to run like I think I have to go get it all change or something like that and I have to go to Target too so I'll see you guys later  background I finished the gym and then I was literally stuck at the oil change place um because it started pouring like horrible it's still raining right now but yeah so I was stuck there and then um I just left I booked it I got like so wet um like running out to my car right now I'm at Starbucks um yes cuz I haven't ate in like three hours like four hours I can't remember but yeah that's what's going on right now I'll catch up you guys probably when I get home I'm not going to go to Target because I don't want to get soaked again hey guys I am back home now I just heated up some leftovers and then I have to change my cup or whatever I had to put it in this one because at Starbucks aren't the person that made it they put like ice and I like my matcha with like a lot of ice um yeah but I am watching this YouTube video um that I was supposed to watch a long time ago but now I'm just getting around to watching it yes   so I still have all these chapters to go through but I wanted to tell you guys about this if you're like trying to get rid of your candy addiction on these candies only have like three grams of sugar which is like from stevia I believe something like that and they're vegan so literally yeah they only had three grams of sugar and this is the best flavor do not try any other flavors um the other ones are like really gummy or whatever but this is the best one to me yeah so if you're trying to kick to your sugar addiction chai V otherwise I literally look so rough because um I ended up taking like a 20-minute nap this is burrow these chapters were making me fall asleep like I can't I can't I can't but we're gonna get back on the grind I have two more chapters to finish and then I'm gonna take the quiz so I can get those done and basically go to sleep because I'm like super tired today super train yeah I'm gonna catch   yes oh and right now I'm gonna put trigger warning because I'm gonna be talking about the George Floyd case I know you guys have probably heard about it because it's all over the news all over social media um but I was suddenly assignment and and I decided to take a break to go on Twitter and I was reading that the cop that murdered him in cold blood um is getting charged with third-degree murder which is basically next to nothing um my opinion he should get charged with first-degree murder because you do not put your knee on someone's neck um her I believe it was like don't quote me I think I've seen 7 to 8 minutes some people say 30 minutes see I really don't know because I was not there to like see or whatever like I would want to see that in the first place but um I don't know how long it was for but basically he killed him yes so I like I do not agree with that and then all the rights that have been taking place um even though everybody doesn't agree with the loading and writing in whatever um because of that is why the case has garnered so much attention and because of that video so I believe if the were there wasn't the loading and rioting and stuff like that um the cop wouldn't have got charged with the third degree murder and I also think that the other cops that were there watching that should be charged with accomplice um yes but we know this is America so I do not have any faith that that's gonna happen and right now it's the perfect time to see um the people that you follow in social media your friends your people you look up to these celebrities Instagram instant influencers whatever they want to call themselves to see um if they are transparent or actually care about black lives matter social issues any or they're just in it for the money yes so be careful and see who is really transparent who's posting swipe up links to donate to George Floyd's family who's posting links to donate to black lives matter who is just doing anything to get this information out for the public to see yeah so we have to see who we surround ourselves with who we follow this and that and I'm just gonna end this with because I'm already like right and going off on a rant um just gonna end this with our world is just basically trash and her president Heike is to like I don't even know like like I'm just like I don't even know like I just can't um yes I'm just gonna end it here before I rant for like 15 minutes because I can probably read for an hour about this not rant I can talk about this frog  hello guys is me I don't even know how many hours is later this took me the whole evening working um doing my assignment or whatever and um it is like really late to actually eat dinner so I'm just gonna make a smoothie because I'm kind of hungry yes so I'm gonna drink my smoothie and relax so I quickly made a smoothie and then I'm just gonna eat all my favorite yogurt salted caramel with a little bit of granola because I didn't feel like making any dinner and I'm gonna listen to ten true scary stories I love when people narrate scary stories yes I'm just gonna end the night hello guys um I just finished up my skincare and I'm gonna head off to bed cuz I'm like super tired and it's like 12:30 I always say I'm gonna try to go to
