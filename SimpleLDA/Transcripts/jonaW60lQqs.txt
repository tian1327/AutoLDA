    hi I'm home I'm back in New York City I'm also wearing different glasses glasses that I wear all the time but an ex-boyfriend of mine told me that the glasses were too harsh and I should wear other glasses I'm wearing these glasses because I really like them anyway I was at my mom's for five weeks which is an enormous amount of time for me and it was fine it served its purpose I'm back in New York City and it's good to be home I got back to the city a couple of days ago it took me three days to feel comfortable semi-normal being here in my apartment it took me one day to completely be compressed from being at home with my family I spent one whole day cleaning my apartment I was probably obsessively cleaning but that's fine as long as everything is clean I cleaned to the point where I exhausted myself but it made me feel better knowing that everything was sanitized I brought back a box of latex gloves which was strange but I I need to go out with gloves now so it took one whole day just to feel just to feel like my apartment was clean it took another day for me to rest I needed to rest my mind from all of the news and the media that I was consuming without even realizing being I my family's house and it got really overwhelming so I needed to clear my head of all of that noise and so do you so it took three days for me to feel semi normal in this very unusual and abnormal situation and that's okay resting my self-worth and now I'm home and it's different it's weird it's nerve-wracking going outside everyone is wearing a mask which is good but unusual but if it helps great most people are wearing gloves also if that helps great there's so much information that I'm almost not sure what to listen to unsure of what's true and what's not so I'm taking the precaution I need to I'm not going to lie doing basic things like going out to the store is actually stressful but I'm trying to do it as quickly and efficiently as possible and come right back home coming back to my apartment in New York City has been a little strange and New York is not the same in many ways and that's okay things have to be different now we have to we have to be more cautious now we have to really take care now take care of ourselves now and each other it took a little bit of adjustment to be back but it's home and it feels good to be home what have you guys been doing what's happening who's watching what what are we watching I keep hearing about the tiger King and I am so resisting watching it but I think I might have to because so many people are telling me I need to see this thing other than that there's no lack of TV to lodge so picking and choosing carefully because once I get hooked on a shell I just start binging and I could easily lose six hours binging I know we're going a little stir-crazy I'm going a little stir-crazy and I realized I don't have to be productive all the damn time it's okay to sit on the couch and watch TV or put some music on and dance around the house or put some music on and clean or listen to a podcast or an audiobook do nothing to now but I am making a conscious effort to not watch the news I will stay informed I will stay up to date with the latest on this on this crazy thing that's happening but I will not be consumed by the news I'm home I'm in New York City I'm adjusting to a new way of living right now and it's okay I'm okay I'm healthy and grateful I've had a number of friends and family that got sick and it was very nerve-racking and we're doing okay I'm grateful this is just an update to say I'm back on there still seems to be some traffic outside but way less people on the street I'm going to be making some format changes to this channel which I'm really excited about so stay tuned for that I've also I have another youtube channel that I'm doing some other special projects on that I'm really excited about I'll let you know more about it when it's near completion which it almost is and yeah I'm happy to be talking to you guys thanks for watching I hope you guys are doing well staying safe staying healthy washing your damn hands let me know what you think about the glasses I love these glasses anyway it's good to be back here if you haven't subscribed keep coming back if you're a subscriber and thanks again for 1000 subscribers amazing slowly but surely we're growing here and it's thanks to you really appreciate it because I am making these videos for you thanks for watching
