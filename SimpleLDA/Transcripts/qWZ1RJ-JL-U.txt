 hey guys what is up welcome back to my channel we just got dressed I'm gonna show you guys my open in a second but just got dressed and ready to workout actually I'm not a trainer and I'm definitely gonna be taking inspiration from other people during this time I'm gonna do some research today and figure out like what's happening on the internet a lot of people are doing virtual classes they're going live on Instagram I know that glove works is releasing a workout video on YouTube everyday so I'm going to link some of those in the description box so you guys can follow along but I'm also going to show you guys the props that I have at home and just some of the things that I'm gonna do to stay in shape and also just like stay sane because obviously working out for me at least is also a big part of the mental game  I'm currently in a squat but to put my hair up today I'm actually gonna be I'm actually gonna fall on the ground today I'm actually gonna be following along someone else's workout my friend Kaylee she is gonna be doing it as well it's one of her friends so the workout starts at 10:00 it's 9:30 so um I just got another request from someone to film a workout video that's so funny what's your name Sarah Elsie here's your workout video girl hope you enjoy so yeah that's the plan I'm gonna show you guys my outfit because I love this new sports bra that I got okay so my leggings are very basic these are just like Lululemon wonder unders they're old but my sports bra is brand new from Jim shark you guys know I love Jim shark I have I have a few leggings and sports bras from them they just released a new training line I believe and these are the new one of the new training bras I got it in this green color and then I also got it in black because I needed a new black sports bra super cute this color is gonna be especially nice when I actually have some color on me the back is very simple like y-shape super comfortable it comes with padding I take the padding out just because I really don't need it and I find it makes the bra like bulkier at least for me I do love that it comes with the insert option for people who just want a little bit more like coverage you know last thing I'm gonna do before my workout starts I think I have like 10 minutes I quickly want to show you guys some of the props that I have at home a lot of these things I've had since my traveling days like actually just posted on Instagram a little boomerang of all my stuff and my ankle weights and my gliders which I'm gonna show you in a sec I've had those things since 2012 so yeah I didn't go out and buy all this stuff I've had this stuff for a really long time but I do think like this is nice to have and use at home I'm gonna sit down the first thing that I'm going to be using are gliders these are amazing you can do so much with these and this is also something where you don't necessarily these exact Liars you can use like small hand towels you can use pieces of cardboard anything that looks slides or glides on a hardwood floor or tiles I guess even I'm gonna be showing you guys this over the next few days the exercise you can do with them and how I plan to use them I guess the next thing that I can talk about is my ankle weights I don't actually know how heavy these are I'm assuming that they're yeah I think they're probably five pounds each so five pounds per like they really burn so I'm definitely gonna be using these and just switching it up you can also use them on different parts of your body I know that some people will like strap them up in a certain way and put them around their waist so they can use it as like weight for squats or like other body movements you know but you would have to google that because I have never done that personally I have oops almost looked myself in the face and I have this band what's the brand perform butter so if you want you can screenshot this my face right there if you want you can take a screenshot of this and you can look at their phone number or their website it's hard to explain if I'm not showing you this is really great for like leg workouts literally put this band around your thighs and you can do like 10 exercises right there another thing that I would love to do in theory I don't think I'm actually gonna be able to do it here just because the ceilings are not that high and I think the jumping is gonna be really annoying for the people downstairs but another really great at home cardio exercises jump rope I don't think anybody really knows this but one of my main workouts in high school was jump rope I would jump rope in the garage like all year round it's just the best workout ever I jump over my glove works sometimes if you really like want to get a sweat and you want to sweat fast get yourself one of these okay so hope you guys enjoyed that um I'm gonna get myself ready for this workout and then see you guys in a bit                      so workout is done workout was amazing I hope you guys enjoyed that I haven't even had a chance to look at it but I'm gonna edit it and make sure that it looks nice and it's easy to follow also check out the description box because I'm gonna write out all the exercises that we did I do know that I missed the last part of the workout I still did it but my camera stopped filming but wow that was amazing again I know I keep saying it but everything to do with that workout is linked in the description box the girl's name who did the class her name is journey she was doing this from home but she's a Pilates instructor based in Santa Monica the workout that we did was essentially like a Pilates Reformer class but then done at home and like you really didn't need very much like you guys would have seen all I needed was a mat which you could essentially use just like a towel for or a blanket and then the gliders right and even those are replaceable like I explained earlier so go and check her out I'm actually gonna message her and say thanks and I'm gonna ask her if she's gonna do it more often during this quarantine period bye that's killing me I don't even remember what I was saying but I just made some food I'm about to eat it because I'm starving made some scrambled eggs and some corn things with avocado say I'm gonna eat that I'm gonna probably edit this video and then just chill I am chillin I just finished editing the video this was surprisingly fun to film I was nervous about filming my workout just because I don't know my apartment isn't that aesthetic and it's not that big but I don't know I think it turned out okay for what it is so you guys beat the judge to let me know in the comment section what you think I'm not gonna make any promises but I think I am gonna try and film a little bit more if like my workouts and my food during this time I need to sit up if I do end up filming my workouts every day and my food and whatever else that doesn't mean that I'm going to be uploading more than usual which means my schedule is going to change so if you guys want to stay updated on when I post a video and you guys don't follow me on Instagram or whatever hit the bell because that bell is
