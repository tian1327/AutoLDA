 hello everyone and welcome back to happy farm life my name is Sierra Richard I'm a pharmacist dedicated helping you live a healthier life in today's video we did something super fun and super weird I flew during the coronavirus so I actually had a business-related reason to travel so I actually flew from Dallas Fort Worth Airport or DFW to Kansas City rented a car and then drove to the home of the Tigers Columbia Missouri here's my experience it was so weird I was like I have to start videoing this because guys this is totally never happened before and I wanted to show you what it looks like so first I Drive in and there's like nobody on the roads it's completely bare I go to the parking lot they actually only had like two of like the six or so loss that they have available open so I went to the lot it was mostly empty I mean there was just like rows and rows and rows there was not even cars and so once I got on the shuttle to take me to the terminal the driver actually told me that normally they have 36 vehicles and they were down to six just six because of all of this so it's really crazy you get to the airport and it is dead there's nobody in the line to check in I mean people were like ready to pounce and be like oh give me something to do I want to check you in I flew American so they checked me in like super quick and when I went to security again no line whatsoever at security none that has never happened I flown through DFW several times and it's usually like it's not always crazy when I go in the afternoon but usually it's not dead like I have to wait for a good bit and I had nobody in mine they also had dots on the ground that we're telling you like stand on these dots to keep six feet away from people boring math so I had I was wearing a mask too so I got down to security I had to like take my mask off and show them my actual face whenever they check your ID security was super quick but everybody like with sanitizing their hand myself after going through that process and you know people going through the conveyor belt and all other people's stuff being you know touching your stuff essentially so then I started walking through the terminal and this was so weird there's like nobody in the terminal and there's no restaurants open and it was just weird so pretty much anything that was like a gift shop was closed a lot of the food places were still closed cluding Starbucks was so so sad because I really could have used an iced coffee it's fine I didn't need it but your candy shops were closed or like I said gift shops were closed a lot of the restaurants were doing takeout there was actually no shortage of to go alcohol plenty of that to go around every place that was open I feel like was trying to give you alcohol to go there was a walking bar so one of the bars in the DFW Airport you could like walk in there was not many people there normally that place is absolutely packed on a Friday evening and there's like one or two people max at any given time most people are keeping their social distance as you walked around they were also doing reminders on the overhead so I'll let you listen to one right now and these were happening constantly like I was actually trying to film some of this for you while I was in the airport but I couldn't because these were going off like every 30 seconds in some different language so it was almost impossible to hear anything other than coronavirus like all the TVs and they were on coronavirus there wasn't that many planes either landing or coming in it was all very weird so now we're to the point where I'm boarding the plane and I think this was where people socially distance the worst there was no social distancing happening getting on the plane like people started huddling and crowding around like before they called out it seems like people are trying but like the second their group was called it was just like mad dash to get on the plane I personally went back and got on last and walked through and you could see that the plane is pretty empty after we got on they started shuffling people around to make sure that we didn't have anybody too close to us so nobody was behind me nobody was in front of me and then in my same row there was a mom and son they were up against the other window so they kept us pretty separated from each other there was no food or beverage service on the flight and it was just short flights so that wasn't a big deal I know that other airlines are doing like personalized baggies I think Delta is doing that so then when it came to exiting the plane they really were asking us to socially distance ourselves and be away from others and some people did that I tried to do that and be respectful of the other people on the plane and during the flight they asked us to keep our masks on only whenever we were drinking or eating to take it off so I followed those rules too and like try not to touch anything I know that it's being wiped down but still I don't know who was on there before me so then I arrived at Kansas City and that Airport was pretty bare too and I went to pick up a rental car and there was nobody at the rental car place which I haven't rented a car in Kansas City before because every time I've been usually flying out and then driving my own car back to Columbia but it was just dead nobody was in there at one point was the only person in the rental car area which is crazy and the lady told me that that was basically how it's been for a while but they've been very very slow and hard Lane but in the cars but the craziest thing that happened in Kansas City was that Delta has grounded most of their fleet in Kansas City I would say most of their fleet but a lot of their fleet is in Kansas City and it was just lines and lines of Delta airplanes I mean you landed and you could see them everywhere and they were all lined out by where the rental cars were and so I just drove past like lines and lines and lines of jets that were grounded because they can't fly right now and they all have enough people's kind of crazy so then when I flew back to Texas I noticed in the Kansas City Airport that it was pretty dead as well a lot of the things were closed they also had a lot of the six-foot reminders there was nobody in lying at security for Kansas City either however that's not unusual because of the way they have it set up you're only like covering ten gates per security line so it's really pretty bare anyway but once again I think that boarding the plane was what people struggled with the most and actually socially distancing themselves because they just didn't do a good job of it everybody just kind of huddled up and then got on the plane and then this was a much smaller aircraft when I flew back and so there's a lot more people nobody was in my personal row with me but there's people in front of me behind me beside me there was people all around they did keep the back of the plane pretty clear where the flight attendants were which they did down on my flight in as well this was much more of a packed flight and then getting off people just shuffled out of the plane that is what it's
