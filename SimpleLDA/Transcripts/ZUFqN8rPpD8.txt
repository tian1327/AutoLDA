 people at the Santa Madness sales in entrepreneurship is it really cracked up to us was if everybody in America is an entrepreneur would entrepreneurs would they be needed well listen yes they would write handsome I've hired guys to sell me a car I've had guys to clean the card to maintain the car we've adapted we've kept people gainfully employed so this world is getting back to who's willing to get up and get to work and I hope that you what I'd be doing right now in this situation if I are you that working hard at the right things pay off people come to this future chance to think like a millionaire to start acting like a milliner to have their mindset shaped like a millionaire so therefore they can become a millionaire and I say not a millionaire paper but a cash flow millionaires but like I say always city it's not about the destination it's all about the journey ain't nothing change alright I know what you're thinking who the heck is this soccer dad I'd be saying the same thing too if I was watching this video listen just walking around here my neighborhood think about this situation raining during this pandemic thing about this whole stay at home everybody's quarantine and lockdown it's not fun for a lot of people I know no I know it's not I've just been reflecting the last 21 years of my career as an entrepreneur has been thinking about some of the decisions I make good bad the successes the failures the things that I did right the things I did wrong and I'm think about so many people going through the same situation right now my moment was 1999 my moment to make a lot of bad decisions was 1995 1996 and it's through decisions through those mistakes I told myself at that point so listen I'll never put myself in a position where I financially compromised my future and when I realized that coming out the marine corps that I had one source of income I had one person saying me came to me I was good enough to get promoted I had one person at one stream of income say you know what one mistake one emergency happens you gotta wait on your next paycheck to make up that mistake my margin of error was so small and I was thinking about my future let's think about children I think I'm like my kids at that time I've got a at that time I had a one-year-old two-year-old he's not 24 years old and I had twins I got a nine year old and now we have our babies not one years old now it's thinking about their future thinking about will daddy be in a position to walk around the neighborhood during the middle of a pandemic during the middle of a potential recession and still be at peace and still be calling that freak out and that put his health at risk and I'm thinking about the decisions about buying a house then when everybody say don't buy a house and buy buy a car when people say don't buy a car and we get an end in it you know like it's buying these things was like a small portion of our income a small portion of what we save the work hard for and I'm think about the people who file unemployment at the beginning of these videos these series of videos one of these I said one episode said I think the unemployment piled that week with six million two weeks later it was ten million and then this morning I'm reading again now it's 16 million people have filed for unemployment so the thing that people are relying on a job or a business or corporate America for the financial security what are they finding now so my challenge to you is this my hope for you this is my encouragement to you is this maybe this is a moment right now if you haven't done so already that you made a move to pivot because there's really three types of feel is happening in America and I'm three Taylor pontificating their next move number one is the person says you know what I'm cool 39 weeks of unemployment I'm cool I'm good with what I got going 30 39 months I can go without having a job I'm at home my standards are reducing they're lowering I'm waiting on my federal stimulus check and wait for my tax refund check and the challenge of that type of thought process is when things some would get back to normal these folks have a harder time to get back into work mode and a thought process to is this you think corporate America is not adjusting you think more people are rethinking or more companies or more business are we thinking do I really need commercial real estate do I really need this big of an office because you know why cuz the demand of the workers is to be home the demand of the workers this gig economy and something about the employees I'm an employee now before I was employed today I'm an employer I'm thinking with my future employees would want to do and some of them asked can I work from home can I work from a position of comforts but still get the work that still be effective productive remotely or virtually and the short answer is yes we've allowed many of them to do that but I think about the typical businesses that's out there that's just not the insurance issue like we are they're gonna have a big compromise of having a time with figure out whether or not their business is solvent in the structure and the way it is the second type of person right now is going through the set of economy and says you know what I went through some pain before I went through combo I went through the oh eight oh nine a Great Recession boom and they've shifted they made great opportunities another sitting on cash cash is king cash flows King thank God I'm cash I'm elevating about this financial situation and they're investing in new businesses and they're waiting for a new opportunity to open up and awaiting for property and assets that are there's going to be devalued and they're coming in when it's low when it comes back up again their basis is low to write it once again to another high point they're waiting to go in the market right now because not like this money is disappearing it's just shifting from one hand to the other there's a third type of person third type of person right now they have some form of income they have a job they got some cash saved up not a lot but they're saying you know what I got some time but in that time I need to learn some skills and he said that I need to improvise I need to improve I need to adapt the potential overcome something that wasn't expecting to begin with and I hope that's you watching this episode because fuel sustainable in madness sales and entrepreneurship is it really cracked up towards was if everybody in America is an entrepreneur would they be needed well listen yes they would right handsome I'm thinking to myself right now I just I'm hiring entrepreneurs I'm hiring businesses we hired somebody to clean our property in our office it's two people rehired we hired people to do work on the house not just to sell us a house but to do work on the house I've hired guys to sell me a car I've had guys to clean the card to maintain the car I fired my trainer instead of training at the gym now he's training me here at the house we've adapted we've kept people gainfully employed we found out different ways to make sure people have an incentive to that only stay but also to improve and to grow and to be bonused when they go above and beyond so this world is getting back to who's willing to get up and get to work and I hope that's you one things I'm teaching my kids maybe that's something they don't want to consider what I'd be doing right now in this situation if I are you that working hard at the right things payoff sadly I know a lot of good friends that are in the wrong industries or the wrong platform are the wrong vehicle and they're getting laid off and they have to shut down their businesses and they have to collapse five 10 15 years of work and pride the only thing keeping them in the business is pride one thing hanging them on but they're basically funding a machine that sadly is dying so I'm encouraging you to make that move into an industry that's shown itself in this crisis to not only be recession proof but also pandemic prove meaning there's not that we're avoiding this virus altogether the fact that we can work and create income virtually remotely without having to be chained physically to a spot now do I believe in an offices where people get to get of course because I miss that environment miss our culture is one thing I've missed about what we do is just gathering of people because there's nothing that you can replace with the virtual meeting there's nothing like a group of field getting together and the energy flow and the excitement just the camaraderie in the esprit de corps that's it stabs when people figure to get together like for example you get more out of concert than you do listen to a CD same thing to it for us in business there's one thing watching it virtually and listening to it virtually but there's another thing when we're synergizing together so that being said if you haven't done so ready maybe one of videos maybe you consider watching is this video right here how to become a millionaire with less than 500 bucks in less than three years why because you're watching the 7 squares quad youtube channel and people come to this YouTube chance to think like a millionaire to start acting like a milliner to have their mindset like
