 hey everyone and welcome to a beginner's guide to festivals a place for all things festivals originally I plan to over everything you need to do in order to prepare to go to music festivals but due to the current situation clearly there are no festivals going on this year so instead I decided to do the next best thing and rate past music festival lineups so first up let's take a look back at Boston calling so let's start off with Boston calling spring 2013 our top spots go to fun the National The Shins of Monsters and Men young giant in Marina and the Diamonds over all this that's a pretty good lineup considering was the first year festival it's clearly pointed towards an alternative crowd which is always a safety bag even though the slide I was 7 years old today I would still love to go to this lineup and for that I'm giving this lineup a 7 out of 10 next up with Boston Colin Fall 2013 it's pretty weird to have the festival two times a year but clearly it works for Boston calling so are top spots belong to a vampire weekend passion pit Kendrick Lamar local natives Major Lazer and The Gaslight Anthem looking at this entire lineup the quality is amazing considering how many future headliners you have here such as Kendrick Lamar Vampire Weekend Major Lazer and even if you look near the bottom you have flume who's going to be blowing up in a couple years so this lineup is definitely more diverse than spring 2013 by I'm bigger rap electronic and R&B artist which is honestly a breath of fresh air and allows a wider range of people to enjoy this lineup so for that I'm giving this one up a 7 point 5 out of 10 so next up we have spring 2014 with the top spots going to Jack Johnson Death Cab for Cutie Modest Mouse The Decemberists Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and brand new looking at the overall quality of the lineup and concerning this was the first time that they moved to the standard three day festival format I would give the fly and okay I personally would only see Death Cab from the top six but maybe that's because I've never heard of the other three headliners the rest of the lineup I loved mainly because I listened to mostly alternative and this was clearly gauged towards an alternative audience and looking back on this the only headliner I see in today's time is maybe Jack Johnson so because of that I'm giving this festival lineup a six point five out of ten so now let's bring in fall 2014 our top spots go to the national Lord the replacement naps with the roots Neutral Milk Hotel and childish gambino honestly it's a bit weird seeing the National back a year and a half later but the rest of this lamp is incredible honestly this is the best one we've seen by far even though I don't know half of the headliners this lineup has four huge future headliners in it those being Lord childish gambino the 1975 and 21 pilot so if this lamp was around today I would definitely be going so for that reason I'm ending this line up in 8 of 10 so next up we have spring 2015 and our top spots go to back The Pixies My Morning Jacket Ben Harper tenacious d and tame impala if I could say one thing about this lineup is that it's way before my time looking at the top six I would only see back and literally none of the other bands even sparked my interest and for me the Restless lineup isn't too spectacular anyway but maybe for an older audience it would fare much better so would it hold a candle today maybe but definitely not me so for that reason I'm giving this one out a 6 out of 10 so here we have fall 2015 and our top spots go to the Evette brothers alt-j Alabama Shakes cozy 8 of Monsters and Men back again and churches so looking back on this lineup I will say this the worst by far as none people are even considered headliners today and maybe that's why this is the last time they had a fall edition of Boston calling however I still enjoy this map a lot more than spring 2015 if I wasn't being impartial I would give this line up around a seven but overall I'm giving it a five so now on to 2016 with a top spots going to see a disclosure Robin Odessa salt Jim Stevens and Haim so taking a look back at 2015 this lineup it's clearly a breath of fresh air it's an overall well rounded lineup with lots of alternative pop EBM with some rock and R&B sprinkled in there it's weird taking a look at this lineup we see a future headliner lizzo literally on the bottom line I personally like the sign up a lot considering having a little bit of everything I enjoy especially in a festival setting so taking a look back I would definitely go today so for that reason that I'm giving it a 7 out of 10 so now moving on to 2017 or the top spots going to tool Mumford & Sons chance the rapper Bonnie bear the axe axe and Major Lazer so looking at this lineup it's definitely the biggest boss and colin has done today at least half of the top spot still headlined festivals today I didn't clearly see that this was when Bob and Collin became a staple and the festival landscape so again there's something in this for everyone and looking at the first five lines it's literally stalked from Weezer to cage the elephant so this lineup was around today I would definitely go to this so for that reason I'm giving this left an 8.5 out of 10 so here we are at the peak of Boston calling 2018 and the top spots go to Eminem The Killers Jack White Queens of the Stone Age the National and Paramore so I only have one word for this lineup and it is stacked this is clearly the peak of boss and calling lineup just by looking at it it clearly caters to pretty much every genre in a huge way you have past headliners and the second and fourth line like the national of Decemberists so this is a a festival I need right now and for that reason I'm giving this lineup a 10 out of 10 so finally we have Boston calling 2019 with our top spots going to twenty one pilots Travis Scott tame impala odessa logic and greta van fleet so the problem with having a peak like we did in 2018 is that you can't go any higher even though this was the 10th edition of boston calling it fell and it fell hard so looking back this festival seemed geared towards an early 20s and up crowd leaning towards an alternative rock fanbase but looking at this lineup it's clear that geared towards teenagers who are only there to see 20 on the pilot or who are only there to see Travis sky so even though I like some of this lineup there's not even enough here to make me want to go so for that reason I'm giving this lineup a score of six point five out of 10 so now let's take a look back at all the lineups side by side from worst to best we have fall 2015 spring 2015 2019 spring 2014 2016 spring 2013 fall 2013 fall 2014 2017 and 2018 so there you have it a look back at Boston calling thanks for watching like and subscribe and leave a comment below telling me your favorite Boston Colin why though
