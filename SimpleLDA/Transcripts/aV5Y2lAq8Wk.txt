appreciate you I appreciate you also this one I got an email about a new brand collab which is really cool whenever I'm like feeling bogged down it feels like I always get reassurance that like okay you should keep doing this but a skincare brand we talked to me for like a hate collab opportunity so look look look at God look at God even when I'm not home they still come on hey leave my papa dental stuff being talked about here guys so I'll be back  okay sorry I've been a little mi blogging fellow meetings today and so that's why also it's really not exciting and we're sitting at this desk over there I'm not really sure what you want to see but I'm about to get in that bed for like 45 minutes before I start class cuz I have class at 6:00 so I look 45 minutes to chill I'm like gonna fish up that blog post in the bed after class which is also gonna be honest desk I love this desk the first so I just found out that I'm an assignment I thought it was due tomorrow at midnight is actually due tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. they I haven't started how do you feel about this you're so weird I had to literally just of my first I just had the craziest email to my professor asked for an extension for this it was literally so cringy so now I'm just patiently waiting by the computer to see see if he responds but to be honest I'm just like probably gonna go to sleep probably work on some of it go to sleep and then just pray that he responds by the morning and today I can get the extension since it's less for me to do tomorrow cuz Trust also part of a lot of work to do tomorrow to for like work work cuz that's just the name of the game so while I sit here in stress over this whole situation I will see you guys in the morning it's Friday and I still have not heard word back from my professor about if I can get that extension so looking like this BJ trying this is are mentally considering the obvious have been going on I decided today I don't give a and I'm just wearing my sweats what my boy one binge and this um blue sweater I'm not getting dressed out today and maybe after I'm done looks like dividing this stuff though I might film some video something have to get dressed like eight times anyway so sorry just made coffee and I guess I'll start working because school not sure how I ended up online shopping but that's happening right now when I really should be working come on I me a discount shop time to find me a discount well no bars are Morse here okay so update I have it's almost one o'clock I've changed my hoodie and I've done nothing so what you want to see what how about paper is going so far this this is the extent a couple bullet points what I have done is make a lot of online purchases so maybe I'll run you guys through those real quick because I'm clearly just trying to procrastinate as much as possible today so so I made a lot of a stuff's orders um because you know everyone's doing sales right now I'm saying I'm trying to take advantage so I got these so this chain just come trying to get more into jewelry and I kind of built that collections I got that the this nope blazer no cuz the same brand of blades of it I was wearing yesterday really like their stuff so this is kind of like a very springy has like a yellow stripe detail which I really like there's this weekday blazer I'm like trying to I'm really clearly getting really into Blazers also um I know it's a darker color but colors that usually are typically found in autumn actually very trendy for this season in the spring I got that picked up this up this a weekday sweater this collusion blazer which is so cool it's like this like two-toned Hans had his plaid the other is like solid it's pretty much like a knockoff of this blue Japan I think it's not the name of the brand blazer that I saw in essence that one's like $800 this was 79 so there we go and then these shorts are never wear short but because I have those new Bottega boots I think shorts will be really cute with those to make them look a little bit more spring I'm going to try those for my return on fire you know and then I also picked up these guys because essence is doing a 20% off sale right now so I picked up a new pair of boots daggers because these are great cost per wear like I wear my ones that have currently so much and what the other lighter color for the spring/summer season because mine are very like autumn colors because they're like brown and beige so I thought the white would be really cute also these are the original ones I almost got before I got the one that currently have and they have like this clear sole which is cool so that's pretty much what I've been doing for the last like three hours and now I'm actually gonna work so buek I've got the extension people honestly a huge relief because I'm already like six hours late to turning this in but you can accept it yay really nice I'm honestly like the only person you ever answers questions like in that class and like I'm really like like we have a good relationship so thank God so this is why you make sure you like sitting from the cache ask questions all that good stuff because when you need extensions you can get extensions life tips buy Jade evidence you're about to click Submit submission received enough to enjoy the rest of my Friday I don't think really anything about exciting is about to happen though us today so I guess I'll just see you guys tomorrow the second weekend of quarantine I know what the hell's happened late almost love we're talking just now waking up like I don't know who I am but happy Friday let's go see Jeb is different when I love the cartoon of course okay so we're just talking to Jamie and thinking about what today will consist of and I'm gonna try and have a lazy Saturday something that Jerry just said I'm flawed in having not doing anything I'm gonna try to relax I don't know they sure had to do that but it's yeah this guest I wanted to film that unboxing though for the said of the season stuff maybe I'll do that I think then I'll make me feel like I'll feel that'll make me feel something productive anyway here's the season stuff I just like disinfect it quite crazy oh let me first tell you what this even is so season is pretty much it's like a Rent the Runway type of company for street wear and like men's and women's fashion but this more just like street wear like unisex pieces like hoodies and they just launched pants shirts things like that and have a bunch of different signers and brands and I'm one of the founding members because I was able to work with them through my current job because the venture capital firm I work with they invested in the company so you know some boxes now I'm just gonna box it now I thought I'm a putt I have like basic membership we're just getting three pieces I'm not well you get you can do three pieces at a time and you can exchange them you can do three exchanges every 30 days I'll include like this stuff here that's like a little bit more about the company and like some of the pieces they have but yeah so there's that and then is also like the premium membership which is unlimited exchanges and you can hold the piece as long as you want when my pieces the ones I get I have to do the math after like 30 days don't mind me when to send it back but if I had the other membership which I think it's like about maybe four you know it's more I can keep the pieces long as I want in exchange anybody's time sighs I want a month so yeah for me just unbox it the things I got this time we're very like rounds where specific cuz I'm not really going it's got some color as well okay so the first piece is from Craig green blue I like that like this black nylon coat and it has this kind of cool like wrap the details on the front I'll tie them on probably for you guys take off those cutouts and then oh here is that the floods have you tell I'm excited about this one oh oh this is thick who I really like this so this is just like a big teddy coat from oh you see the other one of my favs really cool detail the sleeve and it's just really like a really nice thick material zip up and it has like kind of a padded material layer ooh and the last thing is you know just a good old hoodie okay hey guys I came back into the room because last night system I just want to be like well quite really Frank I'm kind of sad to go crazy in here and I that person who's like very go-go girl like always super busy what you probably see like if you follow me I know Sarah my nails like other platforms it's my first time really like doing like personal videos vlog on YouTube but unlike someone who seems like they have it all together it's very Coco girl like doing a bit alien different things like I've mentioned before like I work almost full-time like I still am in school full-time I'm the Big Brother and the Big Brother Big Sister program let's have a little whoo I'm like kind of responsible for us and especially right now since we can't do outings we usually do things every other week and I call them every week now we're doing a lot more calls and we're trying to try to figure out how to do Bert audiences hand you know I'm doing all my content stuff so I mean I'm just getting my blog back up somehow a blog post every other week sometimes every week YouTube videos um first and third Friday of the month Instagram photos every day sometimes it just gets like a little overwhelming and not only that it's sometimes feels that I'm like not doing I know it sounds crazy but it's just sometimes I get a feeling about I don't do one now and I was in such a mood and like I went to the band I was like scrolling through Instagram mistake mistake and it's like looking at all these like super creative people and then like looking at my own stuff like God is terrible like I'm not doing anything and then just feeling that get impostor because like at the same time I'm like getting emails from like possible brand collabs and I'm not even good at like but then like looking at my old styling video that how like thinking about fits look terrible and I'm looking at other peoples like styling videos and like feel like right there like amazing styling like so much better than what I'm doing there's like a lot like impostor syndrome like insecurity stuff and I just want to like kind of put that out there that like yes I do get those feelings all the time but let me get my phone Crytek's to life ever is the best thing to do when you guys feel like that is to just like I feel like just talk about it with someone and so I messaged her and I was like well I'm stressed I'm getting like in my head about stupid chair and this is apartment too damn long and she's like oh that's the worst I know you love going a million places and then I was like I need to stay the f off Instagram haha it's making me depressed it just makes me feel like setting uncreative  I have to just go to sleep and then she's like damn yeah you should go to sleep you are a very creative what are you talking about so yeah that's kind of where my head's at right now and I know it's like that very like like what my channel is usually about but I am sitting there watching YouTube videos and fishing breyer was on she was like saying the same thing I was like you know I literally feel like this all the time I was like maybe I should also like share that on my channel because watching her like she said I know it seems like I have it all together I can read all this stuff but it feels like that like all these different plates everything and you can't get one to just kind of stick and I definitely get that feeling sometimes so that's kind of like a bit of where my head's at the moment actually feel better after talking about it so thanks y'all for listening I know half y'all probably like that's one way to do this whole fire but it's fine but just trying to be
