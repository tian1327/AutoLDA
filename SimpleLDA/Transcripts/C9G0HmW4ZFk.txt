  good morning guys I am comin at you with another vlog I feel like I've been vlogging every day and at this point I already know that people are just so sick of seeing me seeing my room by all means let me know if you are sick of seeing the same thing over and over and over I got a very late start to the day today it's 10:30 8 I just feel so sore and tired and I feel very slow already I haven't really felt like this in a sec and I'm trying to figure out if I want to work out but also my body's so sore let me see how many days I worked out in a row because Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday today's Friday we are having a break day I might do a little bit of yoga later if anything but I kind of want to just have a relaxing day I don't know I feel like this whole quarantine so far I've been home for this is probably like day 12 or 13 by now I feel like I've been trying to be super super productive every single day and just being like go go go but I'm gonna slow it down a little bit have more of a chill day the only thing I really have to do today is well I think I want to film an IG TV plan some upcoming things and vlog possibly well I'm vlogging right now so okay I lied I figured that since tomorrow I'm going to be pretty much filming all day I don't want to take up my morning working out tomorrow so tomorrow will be Maris a we're just gonna push through today I'm wearing another fabletics set I think I'm just gonna do a little bit of indoor biking since I do have a bike now which is super exciting and then probably just some core work I'm very tired I don't feel like doing this we're gonna do it  not too shabby for not wanting to work out I'm actually so glad I ended up working out I probably just would have been very unproductive if I didn't so I'm very glad about that I think I'm gonna shower and get ready the rest of the day  I love oily fur so I think yesterday I finished this I always talk about the rose Argan body conditioner from lush so that's completely empty I'm gonna have to figure out how to recycle that luckily I stopped up and I'm glad I did because I knew I had a feeling that I was going to run out and I wasn't gonna be able to get more so I've got a fresh one right here I think I'm gonna shave my legs today I'm also on my last little bit of the kale and spinach cleanser from youth to the people but again me being prepared I was freaking out stocking up on stuff I have another one that's waiting to be used so that's good especially since my sister's here now she's also using this stuff so it's going a little bit more quickly but what I love about these ones is that it's made out of glass so I can definitely use this for stuff like a plant or just anything honestly so there's a little bit left in that which is good anything I'm gonna do the works do this hair mask shave my legs and come out feeling like a brand new  oh that made me so dizzy oh my gosh I've been using this heritage by Mindy McKnight it's her brand I think you can find it at Walmart it's a leave-in conditioner so so good huh what are you doing testing a lemon you use that as further yeah oh I've never seen that's so here I know you could eat that oh yeah that's where the flakes of flavor like so what do you watching cheer and making a glazed Lemon Poppyseed gluten-free and refined sugar cream so Kayla's currently cooking that up in the studio I think I want to film my ig TV now so usually or pretty much all the time for my ig TVs I use my g7x I don't like this for vlogging anymore this is definitely the most popular youtuber vlogging camera because it's just so easy you can flip it out and it's just so fast and small I don't like how it doesn't have a wide-angle lens and I feel like this camera that I have it's a lot more crisp but I do like using it for my IG TVs and sometimes on a rare occasion I'll vlog with it especially if I'm traveling cuz it's super easy to bring along with you oh okay I just need to set up this that looks pretty good okay I'm gonna film this IG TV and I'll see you in a bit  where I just finished with the IU TV I also filmed like a Tech Talk if you don't find me in tick-tock you shut it a vigil is underscore but I tried out this Freck freckle thing it looks cute but I also I don't think it matches me I don't know I think people with freckles are so cute I've always admired when people have a lot of freckles sometimes I get Sun freckles especially in the summer but I just wanted to try it out because I heard a lot of people worrying about it so I just did to take dunk on it update so I ended up using or wearing it for that of the day I didn't take it off super early and it lasted the whole day I know people said you can use brown eyeliner to make fake freckles but they said it would wear off but the Freck one stayed on super super well so that might be why it's more expensive there's probably better alternatives but just wanted to update you but now it is 1:45 my sisters lemon loaf should be quite finished by now I haven't really eaten today I just drank coffee and I had a hard-boiled egg but that was kind of it so I really need to eat eat but I'm glad I got that done I think I'll probably edit that IG TV now because the next few days I'm gonna be so busy with filming main Channel videos and sponsored stuff so I'm so excited about it I thought that some of the sponsorships I had lined up would fall through because of everything going on but I'm so happy that most of them I'm still doing especially since I'm donating a portion of the revenue for all the April sponsorships I do to this fund that's Hawaii based so I get to help out my community with that so that's very exciting I need to make outlines and kind of figure out what I'm gonna do but I'm gonna eat I will see you guys in a little bit I think I'm gonna change I'm gonna put on a big t-shirt I've been living in these much better much better  so it is a very sad moment because this is the last you're gonna see of the pastel French tips for a while this is my favorite nail set I've ever gone and it's not even that girl now but I'm filming a video that has to go up and be turned in out of certain time so I need to do it now because I'm doing my nails for the video so I'm just thinking but I'm so sad I've never been so obsessed with a nail set and I'm gonna miss these bad boys am I scared to take these off for myself yes but also I have a lot of practice I have the right tools I made sure that I studied up so it should be fine and it's all gonna be okay so if you want to see how that process is gonna go that video will be up early April on my main channel this is your last look soak it in I don't think anyone cares but me but  good morning so it's the next day I was just editing like a rough cut of this vlog and I was like 9 minutes is not gonna cut it especially on quarantine cuz I like watching longer videos and I feel like you guys like watching longer vlogs - today is a filming day so probably only gonna vlog a little bit of my morning and getting ready to film so hopefully that is ok with you guys I just uploaded a vlog than responding to comments you guys are literally the best I'm so so happy that I got extra the other day when I went because now I don't have to leave my house and I can just drink this be ready for the day this looks so freaking good it's not as good I spill coffee every day of my life and this is why I don't allow myself to wear white very often it's not as good as it would be fresh but it is just what I needed today so thank you world it is time to work on the Poshmark orders this process alone will usually take about 30 minutes because first have to print out all the labels and then I package them so I'm gonna do that I think since tomorrow Sunday the post office is gonna be closed so I'll probably just drop it off super quickly Monday's I don't want to go today because I know they're probably a lot of people today and I want to try to avoid that so I'll be dropping off Monday I just want to get it done out of my room so we're gonna do that  everything is all packaged I have to talking about an hour-ish which is a little bit longer than I would have liked but I'm gonna get ready to film if you're wondering oh hi my painting is down some brands legally you can't have artwork or brand logos um so that's why I had to take that down just to avoid that but anyways I still have pimple cream on my face I need to wash my face get ready for this video I need to clean my room so that I can film but other than that I think I'm going to end the vlog here I hope you guys have been enjoying these vlogs I've been enjoying making them just so much that brings me so much joy thank you for watching as always stay tuned on my main channel I have so many fun video ideas coming up that I think you guys are really going to like so I love you so much goodbye
