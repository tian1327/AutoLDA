 grande rising arises  and I said oh never Megan now he on our way to grade us and no Nana Mizuki spaces this is the earliest that I've ever started a vlog during these quarantine series do you know it is about 8:25 right now I woke up in like 8 10 no idea why woke up so early I tell you one thing I'm not to go back to bed and wake up my regular time I look different at 8:00 in the morning like see this no babies for lighting yeah we got a little sunroof thing whatever you call it I don't know I see you guys in like a couple hours you guys so yeah that 8 o'clock a.m. was just so random it was so random I have no idea why woke up at 8 o'clock I haven't bowled over 8 o'clock White's a long while but your girls look at me look cute today or my gloomy day is raining really not much to do today this lower part of my back is hurting for whatever reason I don't know how I slip or I'm not sure I have no idea I don't know if I had to do it work out yesterday but I really didn't even work out all that intense I don't know right now you guys probably hear my phone going on because I'm calling for unemployment and I am on hold so hopefully we'll get through pretty soon as of yesterday the unemployment rate has went to 6.6 million what in the world like the country is almost near a  down I just I just don't know however the good news there was an article about us looking like that we're peaking either we've already peaked or either we're about to peak very soon and I don't know if you guys has been looking at the news but especially Governor Cuomo has been giving the illustration where we can either peek or just come straight down and just decrease in cases and everything gets better very quickly or either will plateau which is keeping it steady and then will gradually decrease and get better and that's just besides going up even so I guess that gives us a little speck of hope because if we're at peak or peaking soon that means that the creators of the diagram they're looking at the data and it shows that at some point we may be slowing down may not it's not a big jump but maybe just slightly like a few numbers or whatever so like I said I guess it gives us a little speck hope that all of this will be over soon hopefully on a brighter note the stimulus checks there was an article instead it's coming between today and the end of the week hopefully I hope so and then the second question would be is where are the second checks because as you probably know they said a thousand dollar checks and then they say the second check will come for a $1,200 check and of course it depends if you found independent or joint you guys my attention span is something else like I always been to clean these windows and I always forget and I always remember whenever I'm showing you the weather but this is the weather today very gloomy and it's raining right now and all those clouds with my gosh so that is what's going on today so far oh my let me show you guys my outfit today it ain't too much to be you know honestly you guys I am enjoying my me to drift shirts until I can't enjoy me any more like I just want to be happy about my stomach my stomach is getting flatter my workouts is going well my eating is going well so I am just pry out you guys there's not a lot of light in here at all I know you're seeing this on camera but that's because it's just so gloomy outside I wonder will I turn on my light would that make a difference okay the difference but you guys this is really unfortunate I think that it's probably going on going to the summertime like June where a lot of things are still gonna be affected I just don't know how everybody's reactions is going to be because as you guys know we have festivals we have carnivals we have fairs we have all different types of events for summer it just doesn't look like it's going to be so much of it and I just don't know how that will make everybody react we are already a little on edge also let me give you guys another update so with my music I still have three songs and I still have to write three songs they have not been on it since this whole quarantine thing it's just I have no idea at the time just butyou know the end the thought you just to be on it like that however I did write another song it's not gonna be on the EP I don't think what it is it's gonna be a dedication to everyone during this time I feel like it is such a dope song it aside to me that you guys have never seen simply because I have really released and push of music oh oh it released one EP but hopefully I can get it together either what you guys are gonna hear it but as far as to EP goes I still have three more songs right now that I have given you guys updates about personal and the news we're about to get I always say breakfast because I wake up so late it is actually 1:45 right now so it's even past brunch it's lunch but I still have a taste for breakfast usually my breakfast tastebuds lasts till two o'clock so a lot of times I could still eat breakfast at 2:00 and still be okay milk sleep I'm just gonna do this strawberries and vanilla clusters and an apple like I said I've been doing pretty good with my eating right links plus on a footnote my stomach's been kind of exit up a little bit for the past 24 hours I'm not really sure what it is every once in a while I think about being stopped but I'm just like I just don't have the urge for it last night for dinner I had a salad before I went to bed a few hours before I went on this line for an hour and 15 minutes that's how long I have been holding on this call my mother this you guys hear how hard it's raining right now hear that wind and the rain together I know you can see the rain it looks like you just see it a little bit but yeah but everyone raining out there it look like big drops - yeah we don't mind going outside today so watches got cute foot house all right you guys sorry about my phone died I don't turn out too far just in case they pick up but just find out some new information about the stimulus chicks this is Dylan with direct deposit if you have already filed for your income tax you're 2018 or 2019 and if you put direct deposit where they sent then your money through your bank you do not have to worry about trying to get direct deposit with these the newest checks it's gonna automatically come to your bank account which is wonderful I'm so glad I found a shin our block and I did a direct deposit if you have not filed or you need to update your bank account there is a website then look for as you can see Forbes is on the top and you see the headline right here how to get your 1200 stimulus payment direct deposit to your bank account so if I don't have this link in my description box I'm gonna try to remember to have it by upload time to YouTube then at least you know what to type in to look up their article so I just want to give you guys a quick update with that really quick in case you was wondering about direct deposit or wondering about the steam of the shakes or wondering how can you get paid from it oh my gosh you guys so check this out I'm looking at this tweet and so this tweet person named Josh Jordan he's verified I don't know who he is sorry if he's famous and you mad about it this is in regards to the numbers I gave you earlier about people filing for unemployment but this tweet says to put into perspective how are you saying the unemployment claims have been all right but read it to put into perspective how it is saying the unemployment claims have been during the last four weeks over 17 million Americans file for unemployment the entire US workforce is 100 and sixty-two million which implies that 10.5% lost their job last month implying a fourteen percent plus unemployment rate guys ten point five percent of the workforce I remember when it was like point three point five and then I remember when it was three percent but ten point five percent that is astounding oh I don't know what this country's gonna do now good news is about unemployment here I don't know I can't speak for other states so I file for unemployment from the restaurant right I also work at pet care as you guys know I can still get my unemployment while getting paid from pet care as long as you work up to three days per week and not making over five hundred and four dollars pretty much at $500 a week so I make less than five hundred dollars a week so therefore I can continue to get unemployment and get paid for my pet care job if I can get through unemployment and just to give you guys an update on this phone call I've been holding on this whole time it has now been two hours solid it is now 235 hi yes oh my gosh I said I was calling because I've been advised to go to this number to see if I can apply for unemployment already applied online but they said I just had to call three three four okay okay so I should I should I go back to the website at anytime oranges I don't have to go back to the to the labors site New York labor yeah don't think it could help you out okay so I just be expecting the call from your representative yes okay do you know I'm not probably pushing it but is it do you think it'll be within a few days yeah okay all right all right I know they're working on it over the weekend oh my gosh okay okay great thank you so very much oh my gosh you guys two hours and 13 minutes before they were able to pick up you better believe if there was a speck of hope that I can put any kind of information for unemployment that I was going to do it oh my goodness oh well I'm glad I got something in oh my gosh oh my gosh oh oh my goodness I try to check the website earlier and the servers are down it's just it's just so wild it's just so wild and as you heard it may be a few days before they contact me back listen that's okay as long as I got my information in it can be you know two three four days you know at least I'm going to be optimistic and say it's gonna be within a week therefore if I can just get through one more week of range oh my gosh you guys so I'm looking at the news right now right and I am hearing that New York is plateauing as far as the reach in these cases so if you guys don't know a peak and a drop is just when it Peaks up and then a drop straight down but plateauing is whenever we reached our peak and we're at a steady pace steady pace that flatlined that's plateauing and then it will gradually go down you're plateauing right now and I'm not surprised because this is New York like I said is over a million people here so I feel like we was gonna be more of a plateau anyway simply because it's so many people and some are just not even following the regulations like even in Florida I feel like Florida would be another state there would be Platt tolling because they have a lot of beaches around oh you guys it looks like we have a speck of LA I honestly just feel like it's gonna be quite a while before we can start back traveling like normal I definitely feel like this phone go all the way into summertime all right you guys so you have seen me do a headstand now imma let you see how far I can go there I hit a split before I do that I'm gonna sweep all right guys visca Oh should've stretched before I try this oh my gosh okay hold on oh that's fine fine I'll go right now oh my god Tiffany you gotta go to a session of stretching and stuff cuz and I just can't be popping his splits you know I never never do that I always have to go through a time of stretching so guys as you see right here where it says states with the most cases of course in New York it's gonna happens in most cases this is insane and New Jersey is second I'm just giving you guys an update with these cases right now as far as different states Wow global deaths 90 1973 oh my gosh United States a 16,000 oh listen listen boy this is a I don't even know what to call this I'm gonna say the wrong word so guys the countries with the most cases here Italy is in process of peaking Germany has peaked France has peaked and Spain has peaked those countries I know for sure has already peaked in their cases which is great and we are now plateauing there are some countries that waited too late to do any kind of stay in a home order or just doing you think about it and they're seeing a very high increased rise of cases in their country I know one of them is Sweden and you would think Norway is a part of it too but Norway actually did in-home orders so Norway is actually doing a lot better than Sweden Chicago unfortunately is doing really really bad right now but you know their governor is on top of things and just trying to shut down everything and just get everybody on the same page and Chicago jail is hitting hard because it's a wide quick spread or coronavirus going on in that jail in my opinion I think they just should how they're building hospitals I think they should do that in the jail there's just my opinion and maybe something better that happens but in my opinion that's just what I think I think they should build a hospital in that jail take care of them United Kingdom that's the other country that waited thinking that they're gonna be okay if they don't do any kind of in-home order or just doing anything about the corona virus spread reiden and united kingdom are both really going through it right now and of course they have to keep the coin protected which is just something else because she's what 92 93 years old my thing is it's definitely been a month solid since this hit and after you to see how everything has played out why wouldn't you think that you would just be okay if you didn't do anything but you should have put in home order or put some kind of regulation in place where you would prevent the spread of quran virus in your country i don't know that's just what i think because when it was announced as a national pandemic because a global pandemic you should've did something right then in there     oh yeah and this uploaded on YouTube oh my knees Poppins yeah you guys the Sun is out see the difference in the cloud - cloudy still clouds though and the time is 450 all right you guys so about to get really close out this blog I'm actually gonna get ready to make a mini salad maybe something else to eat a little bit really don't want to go outside and buy anything to eat cuz I have food here it's just cooking I just really don't feel like cooking this is why I need to find a
