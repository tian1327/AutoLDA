crying and met her future husband so let's think positively here and then someone replied and said in a place called Corona and I just thought was funny cuz I'd like rhymes at Verona which is where Romeo enjoyed a on his face and then she sent me another screenshot Corona is actually where Rapunzel is based in the movie tango the Disney movie Tangled oh that's so funny like what if chances just

lean stocks are just learning how to manage my money better so I'm starting out today it was supposed to be a meeting when I was just gonna be on Google meat so yeah okay I've made it about halfway through the list so we're gonna go for a little walk or maybe a run like I did yesterday it dives the East River Park yesterday like a 20 minute run so what do I know and I'd love to know what do another 15 my exercise thing was painful just like an hour at home like but like I just feel like 15 minutes isn't ready and like this rings maybe I'll do like 15 minute abs just wanna go back okay  okay I am currently making my way home after I run into ten minutes and it's funny like you can ask me how are you get a lot of New York have you finding self you know be honest it's a whole different than my normal week if you're following me on social media you'll know that like kind of in struggling looks like my routine and being alone all the time at least now I feel like we're all kind of in it together which sounds really stable but I find myself getting in better routines I find like this I would never do normally like I would not go matters to get air agenda day on masters go into like a meeting so it is better like a being a little bit more relaxed on myself because there's not if there's not as much urgency but like there never is I just mother is but like sometimes I put too much on too much pressure on myself so yeah yeah it's nice to get a bit of exercise in during the day okay I just did a ten-minute I'll work out when I came back like it so yeah I don't that offer 15 minutes this morning ten minutes there that's 25 minutes that's what if I'm in it wrong 20 minute run that's 45 that's approximately 45 minutes of property exercising and then like walks about back she feels so much like a back should we hide her head like at home though but I wonder is it more beneficial like cuz feel tired oh let's hope so is the one idea is ten minutes odds blast the body coach on YouTube okay and I'm gonna have a little snack I'm having I'm having Greek yogurt and berries okay I showered and now I am reading my book and trying to drink my second liter of water it is
