  where you guys today is Monday a fresh new week and max hey we're ready Rishi today it's a pretty morning yeah some exercises this morning to do the transformation over wall upstairs as you guys can see this wall is black and we want to make it white the only problem is like this wall was really really bad so we were a little bit in doubt to actually do this because we're gonna make like all closets here it's probably gonna take about a couple of months because of corona so we were like you know what in the meantime let's just at least make it wide so it's like clean and it will make this room like really really nice I think our bedroom is honestly my favorite spot in the apartment I'm gonna get a new mirror here with like plans and stuff the handyman so I'm gonna start with a live stream and go to work on it and I guess we're gonna paint today first protector say it again I don't have a pool and answer them different guy  hello friends so gonna paint this black wall white and paint around these little lights should come out but can't find a way to get them out easily if you guys updated  so my stakes everything again the lights are protected the bed is oh my god this is gonna be searching my stielike bedroom there Wow thinking actually just doing a two coats of paint today and then doing up another coat on top of that of the color yeah yeah I don't think I have enough paint to paint over this twice okay I'm gonna work on my next room I had to start sanding this paper by this wall down a little bit because whoever painted it lasted Haribo job you can kind of see the patches we had to get rid of there oh and there's patches up here and kind of see right here there isn't so it's fine here but I don't think the person who painted this last was a professional painter like us where this wall is gonna be completely white in about three hours four hours hopefully and then we'll probably put another two coats on and then we're gonna give you some options it's to pick to which color we should paint our bedroom wall because then there's gonna be like a massive closet built off right here as well which i think is gonna be awesome because that's not all have place to put all our clothes so anyway here we go  so now we have to literally clean the wall and then we can do the first layer of primer I'll try to keep this place is really cleaned within the mob dust that this came out so much dust Sidda thank you Jason there we go okay guys all room s white and so we got all our primers on right now and we're gonna put I think next layers and real paint on there cross fingers we're gonna be finishing today but it already looks so so so nice I think here is gonna be my new filming spot so obviously the week before this I was like daily vlogging every day and then I took like a week off kind of thing and I also just want to say something because I feel you know you guys see like a ten minute cut of each day and obviously I'm showing like the things I do in like exciting moments and I really do try to be productive from Monday to Friday like I'm working and doing things and then on Saturday and Sunday I'm like really taking my time off and that's often why I don't flog on Saturdays Sundays that much because that's kind of really my downtime and I just also want to tell you guys that it is also okay to not always be productive and you know I feel a lot of people really put like a lot of pressure on themselves and especially during these times like you have to do all the work out have to be productive and then when you're like watching TV ordering nothing make you feel this kind of guilt and I I even felt that at the beginning for sure whenever I was sitting still or doing any nothing and especially when I was scrolling on social media I was like okay I need to do more I need to do more I kind of let go a bit of that feeling and I noticed I'm like much more relaxed during the day and I just wanted to to say that to use well because I don't want my vlogs where had you so much to be like an example like okay that means that's kind of stuff with other people are doing right I also have my few times in my just relaxed moments but I obviously don't film everything but I do try to show you guys as much as possible and kind of like the fun exciting moments and I'm gonna make a snack okay it is lunchtime so lately I have been kind of obsessed with the same salad I've been making it over and over and over because I thought it was so delicious and it kind of reminded me and it was a little bit inspired on kind of the Swedish cuisine with like fresh dill fresh like pickles and salads and yeah I'm gonna show you guys how to make this super easy quick salad and it is so so delicious so as a base I have like a really big boiler with mixed greens with spinach masculine it's a little bit of everything you can just use whatever you have at home for your veggies we're gonna start with cutting up a cucumber I think this is why it really reminds me of like Scandinavian choosing with the cucumber the Dijon mustard and we're going to use like lemon and as I said the fresh dill cut a cucumber so I only had like a quarter left I would normally use like 3/4 of just like a fool fool cucumber I'm going to add this then we're gonna make the dressing and I feel the dressing is really important here because this is gonna give the whole salad like a really nice flavor and we're gonna start off with some extra virgin olive oil I feel a lot of people actually are very scared what I wanted to say was that a lot of people are very scared to use like olive oil and stuff in their food because they think it's like high-fat as long as you don't heat the olive oil it's completely fine your body needs these healthy fats so to incorporate that in a dressing is just very very nice so I'm also going to add like a tablespoon of honey to give it kind of like a sweet flavor then we're going to cut up a lemon squeeze this in here to the dressing I think that is actually my to go dressing for silage it's a squeeze of lemon and olive oil and some salt and pepper there we go then I'm going to add a tablespoon of Dijon mustard I know sometimes you can also buy already honey Dijon mustard you can use that as well this works perfectly then we're gonna obviously add a little salt and a little bit of pepper and those to mix everything so I also like to make the base and already mix in the dressing so then when I put the toppings on top then the dressing is already mixed into into the salad I know some people just toss out their salad completely looks like really up to you so as you can see this is what the salad looks like let's try it out  really really good I'm gonna grab the ball the dressing and just almost everything and leave a little bit and I'm already going to mix this so the dressing really like spreads out over all the leaves and make sure not to you dry dry salad here but it's already like seasoned with like a nice dressing so you can eat this as a main dish for like lunch but you can also you can make this like big salad for let's say you have a barbecue or if you're with friends or family I just really love this as like a side salad for dinner as you can see this dressing is all spread out right now then I'm gonna use some pickles and I'm gonna use some marinated artichokes and this is just gonna give a really nice flavor a little bit of crunch as well through the salad so let's grab a couple it's really up to you for some reason I like the smaller ones better into salad but if you have like big pickles or if you like them better then you can use that as well and I think it's a very nice combination of kind of like this sour of the pickles with like a honey dijon a kind of a sweeter dressing and I think that makes this salad super super fresh if I think about like a fresh and clean salad I really think about I think about this and I have about one can of chickpeas I took this out of a can and I rinse it off always make sure to rinse it off when you get something out of the can gets rid of all the salt and it's just like much like tastier and much healthier then I'm going to cut up one ready and like very thin slices make sure to use like a very sharp knife or you can use like a little tool to slice this up I just do this with a knife let's clean it I like to cut the radish like half way through so you don't have like really really big pieces I'm also going to add this to the salad I'm just gonna mix it up like a little bit  put some tops you're gonna make this presentation cute Oswald this is very important in a salad to use some like fresh herbs I really really love dill and I never really thought about putting dill into my salad I never thought that that would have such like a strong and like really nice taste to it but since I start putting Dale in my salad I I'm obsessed so this is gonna give the salad also a very like authentic and like a nice flavor so adding this on the top this salad actually will be wonderful as well to eat with like a grilled or steamed salmon then I'm going to add a couple of marinated artichokes really really love this I have a couple of roast pumpkin seeds I think it's always nice when you create a salad and you start always with a base like a spinach masculine or anything and you have your veggies in there and I like a nice dressing texture is everything for me and I feel a little crunch like maybe tortilla chips or if it's pumpkin seeds or maybe spicy sunflower seeds it always like add something to a salad so I'm adding some like roasted pumpkin seeds I think that would match really well pine nuts could be really nice as well and then obviously this is very optional and a lot of people try to avoid dairy but I really love to just add a tiny bit a tiny bit of feta really finished off with color and just really really delicious combination there we go and I have tiny bit left over of the dressing so I will put that on top so this salad would also be really delicious with avocado I'm actually out of avocado but it will really add like a nice healthy fat and give it like some extra filling up here you go this is my to go salad I actually sometimes just finished hobo for lunch here super delicious super super fresh yeah technique from axis trainer I swear so what are we gonna do now I need a girlfriend my legs no yes so I wanted to go to bed but or wall and our room smells really bad like paint yeah so we don't we don't oh we're tired of you sometimes okay so what we're gonna do we're gonna try to take our mattress down sleep over this is a giant mattress like it's not a tiny one ready for a sleepover this is kind of fun it's kind of like lamping inside reminds me it's a kid where you always were like moving mattresses and like having friends over anyway it is midnight now I hope look a little bit more tomorrow monday was like okay but yeah I'm gonna sleep now what do you do you know that the peanut butter trick you know that one depends on what baby Jeannot that peanut butter cake I was not thinking about this no but the other one this one I said this is so crazy on this week I thought you were using some like wood I'm about to after this a good thing or whatever actually it makes total sense this is how easy is to for oily skin you use oil because oil absorbs oil so for oil in the table you just put oily nuts on them yes so Network stains are coming out of the table I want to show you guys the upstairs because the paint is dry we put her bets there we put our plans there and I'm gonna show you guys it is so pretty so we're obviously we're still waiting on the closets but it's still probably gonna take like two months but it's already so so much better
