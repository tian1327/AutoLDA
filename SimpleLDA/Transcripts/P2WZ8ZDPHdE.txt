 Hey there world travelers, hey there, I'm
Tanya and I'm Dave and we are Turn It Up World, today we're gonna be talking about
some of the things you're gonna want to know about the reopening of Las Vegas now it's been close to three months
since Las Vegas has been closed due to the coronavirus a city once full of life
and bright lights now felt dark and empty
we know the hotels of casinos have been working hard on their reopen safety plan
to help their guests and employees feel safe when we heard the recent
announcement from the Governor of Nevada that Las Vegas will reopen on June 4th
2020 we just had to celebrate yeah that's right we put out a lot of
fun and informative Vegas content so if you haven't already be sure to hit that
subscribe button and that notification bell so you get notified every time we
post a new video all right so to kick things off again the casinos are opening
up on Thursday June 4th and on the Strip most are opening up between 8:00 and
11:00 a.m. now off the Strip they're actually opening up earlier at 12:01
a.m. so early birds you can get there quick get going at a faster at early
early in the morning and we picked a few of these resorts now we'll put many of
them in the description box below some ones that we can think of they're
probably gonna be more but this just gives you like a general idea of what to
expect when you show up Las Vegas for the reopening starting with the Bellagio
the Bellagio is set to open up their doors on June 4th at 10:00 a.m. that's
awesome they're also having some really special
fountain shows right yes with three dedicated songs that they're gonna be
playing throughout the day I think the first is called Simple Gifts which is
by Yo-Yo Ma and Alison Krauss and that song they're going to be dedicating to
all the frontline workers during this coronavirus pandemic and I believe the
second one is the Star-Spangled Banner that's right yes, oh yeah and of course Viva Las Vegas now for those who don't know what's going on in Vegas right now we do know that it is hot now so if you're thinking about well what about the pools so I can cool off
and refresh enough yes they are going to be open but with a select amount of
cabanas so I'm not sure how that works in terms of reservations if you need to
you know schedule that for the pool area but they are gonna be opening and they
will have some cabanas that's pretty cool and also the salons and fitness
centers are opening up as well so you can get a little hair done that's right maybe eyebrows yeah oh yeah so just might have to do that and for those you that really enjoy
the Conservatory the gardens they're putting on a Japanese spring garden
display in that Conservatory so that's wonderful alright so next up Caesars Palace the casino is opening up at 10:00 a.m. on Thursday and there will be free parking
for visitors which is really cool most of the restaurants will be reopening now
Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen is actually opening for dinner only so make
sure you make reservations for that that can get really busy
and for those of you who like to shop many of the retail outlets at the Forum
Shops at Caesars Palace will be open as well so next up is the Flamingo now the
Flamingo is gonna be opening up their doors on June 4th at 10:00 a.m. they're
also going to be offering free parking now what's interesting is that select
Linq Promenade retail and restaurant outlets are also gonna be opening their doors on
the 4th and that's going to be about 10 a.m. what I'm looking forward to is Dave
and I did this really fun ride on the High Roller so the High Roller
Observation Wheel is going to start opening up at noon on the 4th and they're
gonna go daily from 12 p.m. to midnight now a few of the bars and restaurants
that we are familiar with that are gonna be reopening I believe is one the
Bugsy's Bar the Pizza To Go and of course the X Bar now the Beach Club pool Resort Pool and the GO Pool are also going to be reopening so beat the heat
beat the heat another very popular Las Vegas Strip casino that we thought we would talk about is the Cosmopolitan and the Cosmopolitan is opening up at 10:00 a.m.
on Thursday with free parking for visitors, very cool, and the casino which is
opening up is also including in the opening the sports book and the high-limit room
another very cool thing as well and most of the restaurants and bars will be
reopening as well in addition to that the spa the salons those are gonna be
opening up their doors and something I know a lot of folks look forward to I
know I would look forward to this because I enjoy it is the . . . that's not
baseball that's tennis y'all their outdoor tennis courts will be reopening along with
their fitness centers but the Boulevard Pool oh hot days Boulevard Pool is gonna
be reopening they're gonna be spacing out those seatings and they're gonna be
providing cocktail services for their guests at the pool hold up wait a second now before we go ahead and mention our final hotel resort and casino which happens to be one of our favorite hotel resorts and casinos in Las Vegas we thought we'd
mention this one because they're doing something a little bit different than
some of the other casinos let's talk about Harrah's now Harrah's is set to open up their doors June 5th yep that's right June 5th not 4th at
11:00 a.m. one of the things they're looking forward to is they're gonna be
debuting their new 200 million dollar multi-year resort transformation
featuring new rooms featuring new suites remodeled casinos
the floors the lobby and I believe they're refreshing the Ruth Chris
Steakhouse a lot of things coming for Harrah's stay tuned last on our list and
also one of our favorites is the Wynn and Encore absolutely we love the Wynn
they have been leading the pack when it comes to dealing with this coronavirus
pandemic and also the reopening we did a full video on some of the safety things
that the Wynn will be doing on our YouTube channel if you're interested you
can check that video out it'll be a link in the description box below but one of
the cool things the Wynn is doing that's a little bit different than a lot
of the hotels and I think the only one that I've seen so far is that they're
going to be opening their doors on the 4th at what time?
12:01 baby 12:01 yes I mean 12:01 that's like Christmas morning it's like when Christmas is the 25th it's really the 24th 12:01 a.m. 25th exactly they're opening up all of their restaurants and eateries which is very very cool yes now the only restaurant
that will not be opening up is ELIO that's their new Mexican restaurant
that's was just a debut that was supposed to happen this year it hasn't
happened yet they're waiting for that to happen I believe that set to start on
the 15th of June you may be able to make reservations on the 14th which is what
we've been seeing but the 15th right now you can make your reservations for ELIO the Wynn and Encore's pools will be reopening the golf course will be
reopening and also the spa and fitness centers are reopening as well there's
gonna also be some nightly entertainment going on over at the Lake of Dreams so
stay tuned for that I'm sure it's gonna blow your mind for this reopening as it
always does and now that we've talked about many of the casinos and activities
that are reopening on the Strip we thought it'd be important to talk about
the safety protocols being put in place now one of the reasons we're choosing
the Wynn as an example is because they have been leading the way when it comes to this coronavirus pandemic from the beginning to the reopening they've also enlisted
some of the top medical help from both Georgetown University as well as John
Hopkins University to really help kind of construct their health and safety
protocols which in their opinion is gonna be the new gold standard in the
industry and one of the great things they're doing is actually testing for Covid-19
all of their employees yeah and that's great it gives us a lot of comfort as guests and
also all employees will be wearing masks of course as well and they're
they'll encourage the guests to wear masks and also give them masks if they
don't have them but guests won't be actually required to wear masks but
you should out of respect for you and your fellow patrons and employees and
just people in general I think it's important for all of us to wear masks
unless you know for one you've been tested and you have the antibodies of
antibodies of antibodies of antibodies I suggest you wear a mask yes and lastly
at the Wynn and other casinos as well expect to see social distancing put into
place in the restaurants and casinos and other public spaces yes as a
matter of fact we did a full video on the Wynn health and safety things that
they're putting in place for the public to know on our YouTube channel we'll put
a link in the description to that video below definitely go check that out if you're interested so we hope this helped you guys get a
little bit of sense of what's going on for the reopening of Las Vegas if you have
any questions definitely leave them in the comments below
we do our best to get to all the questions we're so excited for this
reopening if you guys enjoy and love Vegas as much as we do we hope you're
just as excited and as always we look forward to seeing y'all . . . in Las Vegas
