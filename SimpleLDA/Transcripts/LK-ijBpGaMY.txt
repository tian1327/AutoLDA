 you want to sing turn but as Mike relay reports some believes staying put is the safest choice I just really don't know how much longer we can all do this so let's maybe been three weeks maybe four weeks since I've recorded my are you surprised because I got to be honest I was really just kind of debating whether or not you guys would actually want to see this video because you know everything about me is just not serious and this is a very topic it's really hard for me to sit here and try to you know fully be myself and not want to be as professional as I can about this topic because of how sensitive it is but anyways back to the video yeah it is wild is this crook him sorry I got this new like travel tripod travel I just made that up I just got this new tripod I'm sure and I don't know from quick right now so I really apologize but today I'm going to be vlogging my coronavirus prep me my mom about to go and get some last-minute things for the most part we're already prepared you know if we gotta sell corn so we got soaked corn see this Roni chupa batter brownie she's sweet if you know that song I really miss with you but yeah we got to go you know show the screw out of our separation okay so we are outside we just got you know the Dunkin Donuts we got our gloves for whenever we go out in public places we bout to go to the drugstore we might go to the grocery store get a lot less I can't speak we bout to get a couple last-minute things probably a couple  so yeah I ended up going to Wegmans and a couple other grocery stores with my mom but what was something that is very common which I'm sure that you've all seen is when you go to the grocery store all the shelves baby they are gone like water like hand sanitizer a Lysol like that's definitely just gone like if you don't get to the store when it opens baby is gone okay but like stuff like bread cheese you know little other like I guess you could say like essential staples in your fridge this starts to come pop back up and grocery stores but at first like everybody was freaking out okay like this was this was like in Jersey like it was like hurricane season  but yeah honestly now we try not to even leave the house really anymore it's so hard for us because we're used to going to the grocery store every two days but now we can't do that anymore so we really only go we have to go especially because we're all high risk like maybe my dad has cardiovascular issues my mother has high blood pressure in asthma I have maybe I'm high risk that's not cute okay it's not cute at all and it's really crazy because the majority of people who are really suffering the worst and a lot of deaths are coming from people who are african-american and it's so crazy because a lot of African Americans have a lot of pre-existing conditions that factor into people who end up getting the coronavirus end up struggling more with or you know happen to see more symptoms according to the news so it was crazy at one point black people did not think they could get this virus like we was really saying here like big black people getting to grow hey we ain't get it oh it was really like we don't need a vaccine baby melanin is the way to go  it was crazy because even after Rudy Gobert from the NBA God and we were like no but the girl it got real so look this morning I got some test results back for coronavirus and it came back positive yeah really yeah we was in the back layaway so black people can get it for real yes yes we can hey y'all so it's actually a couple of days later I just woke up I basically decided to make this a little bit longer because we're about to actually go pick my sister from New York at this point we just feel like it's smarter if she comes huh we just feel like at this point it's just safer if she comes home because well we as a family just feel like collectively would just be safer if she came home and not still in New York because I think New York at this point is like the last time I shot was 3,600 cases that have coronavirus I put the information of the amount of cases and deaths that currently happened as of up-to-date so yeah we're gonna go ahead and continue with the vlog so I decided to include this in the video because this was something that almost tore my family apart my sister lives in New York you know in New York at the time was had the most cases at the time and my sister for the past two and a half months and that was like end of March had been wearing a mask because of the fact that she was so it hadn't even hit the United States yet I don't even think but my sister was already paranoid about the corona virus and around the time of I think February January she also got the flu really bad so she just started wearing a mask in general but basically we brought up the situation to my doctor and she basically said that my sister she feels like could come home based off of the fact that necessarily we don't know what either of us you know is caring at this point and to be honest it would just be you know kind of directed as in go about it with in caution and so because of the fact that she was in New York and New York had the highest cases of people who had the corona virus it was just very scary for us as a family because we didn't know what she was exposed to but then yet again we don't know what any of us were exposed to and it took us a while to sit there and try and figure out whether or not we were gonna allow her to come home because around the time the news like the local news was reporting on New Jersey families who are having like a vent there was a family that had a wedding and literally like the entire family got coronavirus and that's what we were afraid was going to happen so but yeah I'm so glad that my family's all together obviously we're all very healthy it's been over two weeks which is the protocol but now some apparently some sources say up to 24 days but I'm glad she's home I'm glad she's safe it's crazy how even when we went to New York people were still outside like nothing was going on and that's the issue that I keep seeing even now three weeks later people are still going outside and going about their lives like nothing is wrong it's honestly ridiculous you have thank you guys so much for watching I really hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope this video
