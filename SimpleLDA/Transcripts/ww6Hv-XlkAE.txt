 hey it's me Karishma again I am in my second week of online law school um not too much has been happening but you know enough I'm living back in Oregon again yeah we'll see what's going on this week but today's Saturday so I think that maybe I'll film through Friday and it'll be like a week in my life of quarantine um today I'm actually going to start baking a loaf of sourdough or like making it so it'll go in the oven tomorrow I'm very excited I'm trying to make a tummyache loaf as I'm afraid it's gonna fail so we'll see what happens but so I started my sourdough starter I think like a month ago but I'll show you what it looks like this morning I don't know if anyone's interested in this baking content but I thought that I would never get to this point so it was harder to show you my progress where my sour dough started last night when I am at the top of that tape um when I first said it and then overnight and his words in that much this is my garden so far it's doing okay some things are doing better than ever I planted this vegetable garden last summer so now I'm like replanting it for this upcoming year which has been really fun and is something that passes the time so every day when a feedom a sourdough starter I viewed it like at least once a day sometimes twice a day and I fed it last night and I need to do something with the sourdough discard so I made  so now it's about five hours after I first started making the bread this morning so I'm about to shape them I don't know if you can really tell but there's some small bubbles which is good news for me looking really great self-care Saturday I put some oil coconut oil in my hair to kind of like our rinsed out the Mende and I put the coconut oil on my hair and I leave it in for a couple days unfortunately my hair will look this greasy for a couple days  you tell me you love me go start the car  sunshine mixed with white hard angel the Daredevils brainless feeling I just can't fight sorry Easter breakfast I made this Greek yogurt and my mom has put rose and Sachi on it the poblano has new growth again the help he was looking really sad about it this guy isn't looking so hot either that bill bell pepper in the back it's really coming in strong  you see me    today's being a really relaxing day I took a nap earlier I had a friend come over and we painted socially distant but now it's late it's 9:15 and I'm still doing my readings for tomorrow so good morning um it's Monday I'm about to start taking make contracts class but of course I just woke up and realized that my laptop is dead and in charge last night so tell my Monday is going but it's almost 7:45 which is when my class starts performance but there is performance and the question is contract just got done so I'm out here watering my garden cuz I have a 10 minute break for cipro next time if you're going to bind non-parties he may start her I have to do something with the starter the most common thing and the easiest thing I do is make this like like a pancake type like fried dough kind of thing yeah usually turn felt like scallions and sesame seeds in it   now I'm making some yogurt I just learned how to make yogurt like two weeks ago um it's pretty easy pretty much just boil some milk mix it with some e over after its cooled down a little and then let it set  I've been trying to become pen pals with a couple of my friends and also my boyfriend because we're doing long-distance right now but this letters actually just from a friend who goes to Yale   because I'm just gonna I just finish my readings and sometimes I find it hard to like go straight from like finishing readings to sleep um so there are two things that I've been doing to kind of calm my anxiety and make it a little bit easier for me to fall asleep quickly um because I find that if I put in the time of front I spend lost time just like a week in bed being unproductive so I in situations like this where I just finished the reading and I still have to go to bed straight away i journal and so that's what I'm gonna be doing the other thing that I've been doing every night which I found has been really helpful is meditation and I'm not someone who's ever meditated before but I got an email from Lumosity that there Lumosity mind app is free right now and so I decided to download it and try it out and it's honestly being a really helpful really easy way to like learning how to meditate and like some days are better than others um but over time I find that I've gotten I've gotten a little bit better and I can use some of those techniques even after the like five minutes of meditation is over to help myself fall asleep much faster so I don't know if anyone else is having these problems but for me of those two things have been really helpful so today Tuesday I have three classes I already had a legal research writing this morning I'm in my property class right now but we have a short break and I have to wake up at 6:30 um on Tuesdays and Fridays for class um so it's really early so I have like a lunch break right now but it's still really early for me but I'm feeding my sourdough starter and I'm making banana bread right now and then I'm gonna water my garden go finish some reading and then go back to class  unfortunately so I just um so I'm about to go to bed cuz I wake up very early these days and now I'm about to finish off a letter and meditate so it's Wednesday morning I've contract sensitive program it says one council to rule them all one notice to find them one forum to bring them all and actually the baby tomato back there is doing really well all of the broccoli are doing great just that bok choy is doing good the rest are dead for some reason some of the peppers to the peppers are doing good so that poblano is doing great thought baby Dowell in the back is doing fine that Bell not so good and then the healthy nose is very very dead so I think that if it doesn't start to have some new growth in the next couple days I'm just gonna plant that one haven't seen one of these guys since I was like literally in elementary school but there's a little Rollie pollie right there I'm not gonna bother him I love him obviously I feel like it's really hard to tell but now that my hair is finally dry and I've washed all the money out um you can see that my hair has like some brown he was always brown but now I think it's like a little more reddish to be honest Mende doesn't do that much it's just conditioning especially since my hair is pretty dark but you can kind of see that it has like in the light some different texture I'm not texture bun a dimension   there's the update on my yogurt I strained out along the way so it's more like a Greek yogurt Thursday morning I got ready a couple minutes early which is nice but also like that means I kind of stayed in bed a couple minutes later some time for contracts I feel like cuz classes are past an opacity I don't have some motivation so like usually I'll just like sit on my phones instead today I've been painting during class so hopefully it's better here is the finished product just got done with class you can see my progress here my first painting from two days ago here second painting oh wait that's upside down and then here my third painting you know we're learning  was good I you know started off making art which was really good and hopefully I'll continue doing that because I found it to help me pay attention in class and also just made me feel better so so I finished up my reading this morning went to property um I actually painted some work like I hoped here is my painting for today's property um clearly was inspired by the subject of the class I actually tutored for like the last hour I'm this kid who I'm cheating in geometry just got done with my race class and I made this piece of art so been really productive today    so Sunday now the vlog is over but I just wanted to provide a small update on the jalapeno it's gonna be really hard to tell but you can see in the little joints there there is in fact new growth so success everything else is still dying but that is
