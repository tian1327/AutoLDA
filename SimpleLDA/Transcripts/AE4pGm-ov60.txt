 hello I'm Tim this is Verde vlogs it's around 9:30 in the morning yeah a little over two weeks now since the school shut down so I decided to take a stroll see my family still asleep you know one of the perks of working from home and not having school I suppose earlier today the New York Times posted an update that the New York virus count is doubling every three days that brings me something that happened to my family recently you know my aunt she lives in Manhattan she's been calling my mom a lot telling her how frightened she feels just the other day someone's I'm living in her apartment complex you know right next to her she got dragged out on his stretcher with a mask and everything it's not ten started raining MMH so I came home yeah what I was saying about the New York situation is that it it worries me who's to say Palo Alto would become a hotspot like like over there sure they're more densely populated they've got more people but that late times just this morning Slocum Valley leads California in deaths of 13 now so what we're far from New York were definitely far from safe but sure what President Trump is saying about reopening the borders by Easter filling up those churches I think it's a little hopeful not soon we shouldn't hope for the best sometimes saying things like that can inspire people to to not prepare for the worst which i think is the wrong move in this in this and this time it's now 1:30 I just finished a brunch pancakes it was just pancakes actually so I'm gonna work that off by playing some basketball it's currently seven o'clock and I just finished bench watching two great movies I definitely prefer one over you and both worth the watch for sure the first film it's called the platform the Spanish horror flick with the very clear moral to the story Plus why don't things it's matter teams second film it's called there will be blood it's fine it's 11:00 now that about wraps up today's vlog thanks for watching hope everyone stays safe same following us around for future updates okay bye
