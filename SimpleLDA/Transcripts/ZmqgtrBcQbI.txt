 okay it is 910 p.m. it is April 11 my flight leaves in two hours I leave LAX at 11:30 and I arrive at JFK at 8:30 a.m. on the 12th I'm gonna be living out of a hotel for the next two months so I'm just kind of soaking it in this is going to be probably the biggest decision I've ever made and probably the riskiest so okay look I know what you're thinking okay like really a scarf it's not a scarf it's it's part of my ninja costume you know I'm just getting much see it's a little face mask for like skiing and stuff rated and fifty meaning 50% of all particles get through I'm just kidding it's something okay leave me alone also jealous I know you're jealous you saw the Instagram story you know what's up okay this part is completely empty here at LAX the flight is departing in an hour I'm not gonna walk to the hospital every day or from idiot uber figure it out and we'll see how bad the walk is but that's it this is it so now right now Magic Johnson's gotta tell you something okay Thank You Magic Johnson so getting kind of hungry I don't think anything is open I totally lost my drive I guess we're boarding now  there's no one here man absolutely nobody alright here we are I guess this is home let me give you the tour if you didn't see earlier driving through the city driving through Times Square that was insane you're on the street you know this is crazy then you have time you can go to time school like in ten years I have I have driven in this city in snow in read yeah this weather in all kind of like occasions Christmas Easter doesn't matter at that place it is always powdered even in snow people are crazy if they are making pictures I'll probably post more on my Instagram so you can check out what's going on but let's see oh we got a pretty good view pretty cool view of the city absolutely deserted completely deserted yeah Wow okay hopefully they have some energy drinks outstanding in the menu I'm just gonna do room service I don't feel like going out right now I'll probably have to go out later anyway because I got to see where the hospital is apparently it's 30 minute 30 minutes away a 30 minute walk yeah man I have a headache he was saying that everyone who's checking in here is a medical professional everyone same thing with the uber driver he was like yeah everyone who picking up when hundred percent of them are medical professionals people who are walking down Times Square all there were medical professionals hi I'd like to order room service okay no Red Bull I gotta get an energy drink quickly before my brain explodes okay um got a little snack feel a lot better now walking around Manhattan seeing these empty empty streets I was here three years ago for a wedding and obviously some of you have been to New York already it is insanity like you can't see anyone on the streets everyone that you see that are on the streets they're wearing masks but and it's it's completely different place it's really really creepy um let me show you my setup here don't want me if I eat which is about yelling for the self okay first thing I come into the door I have this is my dirty shoes so these are the shoes gonna be wearing to work so procedure is coming from work dirty shoes off slippers on can I come here and on this bed I'm not gonna I'm not gonna use this bed for anything other than like stuff that bed I'm gonna use for for sleeping just kidding I'm gonna sleep on the floor so that's my sleeping bed this is like the decontamination that so I have my gloves I have masa get masks and gloves are in here I'm gonna take out the map so it now just imagine tie my gloves I got some alcohol swabs and then all my stuff that I swab is gonna go here and then then I take off my glasses and I take so that's my dirty glasses and now I have my clean glasses here and then I obviously swab everything you've obviously seen the TV before I brought the switch I don't think I'm gonna be using it but Colby most of my free time is gonna be sleeping working five days anyway so now you're my little computer and then obviously my bed got a little charging station here I'm a little closet here for my my jackets and stuff in here undershirts this one nothing yet so I'll probably put a box here we got scrub scrub pants scrub tops I don't know the point I brought a lot of scrubs and the reason why is like I'm gonna be working seven days and I might not have time to do laundry which reminds me I gotta know what their laundry situation is let's say that they need me to work extra so they made me work six or seven days that I'll have time to do laundry I have seven pairs of scrubs for the whole week so you go entire week without laundry but that's it this does this look stupid I tried to make it look cool I don't know okay quick update today is April 12 it is 1 o'clock p.m. there's a couple things I want to do before my first day tomorrow so I just want to have some time I don't want to be worrying about filming stuff and I just want to have some time to edit this first video get it out probably won't have time until my days off which apparently I'm gonna be doing float shift I didn't know until now so I might be flip-flopping from days two nights so that's that's gonna be killer but but I'm already doing that now so whatever it's not nothing that I'm not used to okay so basically really eerie going through LAX no one's there the only people who were there are maybe the six other people on my flight every person on the flight had their own row it was insane it was really really weird so I had the window seat two empty seats next to me and then the aisle over this there's no one there and then everyone had basically that or every other row was empty it was really really weird basically boarding the plane took two minutes no less 30 seconds and then exiting the plane took even less in baggage claim was really weird - there's only one baggage claim conveyor belt going and everything else was shut down it was like a ghost town when I arrived it was really insane I was talking to the uber driver and he said yeah all the people that I'm picking up are there 100 percent of them are medical professionals everyone that you see walking around in Times Square they're medical professionals and he's lived here in Manhattan for ten years and he said made him sick it made him really really you know depressed sad and scared seeing the city like that and he was he couldn't believe it when I was asking yeah what's the traffic usually like around this time oh my god 8:41 if you come from the JFK to the city at this time now like it don't like almost 30 minutes to get here yeah weather why is it not less than thirteen years Wow there's been evil yeah like if you got this time in are you kidding me at 8 a.m. yeah let's say it's gonna take us 30 minutes to get to your hotel or normally if it only took an hour that'd be really good normally takes an hour and a half at you know it usually it takes an hour and a half now it's a joke and we were going through Times Square and it was like empty completely empty I'll try and show some clips of that but it's sad it's sad it's crazy because I was here two two no three four was it four years ago five years ago five years ago crap I'm getting old but yeah I remember being here it's a complete it's it's so busy we were looking at the busiest Street in Times Square absolutely empty and he said yeah you know if you're an uber driver and you stopped your car here you get a ticket but now there's no one in the streets so yeah I really don't know what to expect it's just a really really weird and sad situation out here we're gonna see what the whole work situation is gonna be like so I know that it's Lou's hectic over at my other facilities as you just see that the code units expand and all of a sudden a couple kovat patients all of a sudden the whole unit is all kovat you know no matter what facility that you work at you know I'm working every day so it feels like I need to be have perfect procedure always I can't make a single mistake so it's just it what's really important is that you're on top of your game no matter what you just take your time you know even though time is really important especially patients that are critical it's just important that you one of the one of the people who is precepting me and my last facility said doesn't matter if it's an emergency take your time don't be running in there if you're not ready protect yourself first so take your time Don your PPE properly make sure you got everything double-check and then walk into the room which he's right he's right it's important because if you get sick then you can't work if you can't work you're you're not helping people so that's it that's it for now I want to say thanks for all the support by the way I wasn't expecting this much support so thanks guys but you know it's not about me it's about the situation it's about doing your part you know some people they were gonna grocery store okay some people they do the deed or - it doesn't matter where you're working where you're working it depends it it is all about doing your part whether it's you staying home and working or you buying groceries for someone who can't buy groceries it it has nothing to do with where you are and what you do it's about doing your part again thanks a lot probably see you next week I don't think just follow me on Instagram I'll probably post a lot there I don't think I'm gonna have time to edit now that I think about it so that's it guys thanks a lot and probably see you next week bye you
