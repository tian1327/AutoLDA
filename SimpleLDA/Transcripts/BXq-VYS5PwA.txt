  all righty I am in the car officially all packed up in the rental my lips are really dry but I'm running extremely late Oh flip I threw out the Sun pass how did I forget the Sun pass   all right let's try that again  hey guys it's crazy how much brighter it is on my mom's house actually is blowing my mind but anyways I've been pretty m.i.a since I got back I've just been planning out my apartment visit when I go to DC tomorrow and working on a few other things I worked most of the day yesterday but since today was the day before my flight so my flight is at 6:30 a.m. tomorrow so I have to get up at like 4:00 and leave here by 4:30 so I'll be on the plane in actually I'll be in Atlanta in 24 hours but I figured before I go and like just start looking at apartments I wanted to give you guys like some kind of preface as to what I'm looking for in general we're just gonna assume that that's a good angle anyways so really the main goal is to just look at different places get a vibe for different buildings different neighborhoods and figure out what I can get for the price that I can afford I've already looked online a bunch I have five tours currently set up where my office is the rent just seems to be a better price so I can kind of get more square footage for the same price and the neighborhood where my office is which you're probably thinking like well obviously like you should just live where your office is then like why would you not if it's cheaper but at the same time the neighborhood I'm just not sure if that's where I want to live and everyone says that like you know where you live is kind of like the neighborhood you spend the most time in and if I'm working and living in the same neighborhood I don't want to like box myself in and not go anywhere else all right let's migrate ok so sorry blabbing and blabbing point being I'm looking in three different neighborhoods is my point I'm not exactly sure what I want but what I'm looking for in price range at this point the price range is that I'm touring our 1800 to 2022 hundred dollars a month basically today's Tuesday it's about 9:30 I'm gonna try to get some work done now I want to work as much as I can because I won't be really working the rest of the week I'm gonna bring my work laptop and stop by the office for probably a couple hours and I might get a couple hours of work in but most likely I'm just gonna be meeting everyone and not getting any work done so we'll see how it goes but I'm overall pretty excited but also really nervous so I'm just I'm ready to just be there already so I can kind of just start not being so nervous but I don't know so I'll definitely keep you guys updated yeah I got a couple hours of work done almost three hours and then I decided to take a lunch break which turned into apartment hunting and now it's 1:30 so great but that's all right and yeah I'm not feeling very well so hopefully I get better soon because I don't want to be sick for my trip I'm gonna go take some vitamin C though yeah      I see    yeah     it's been quite a while since I film that last clip I ended up looking at about eight apartment complexes I think Oh No hey it was a pretty long and exhausting trip so I ended up in the end deciding on the studio apartment from the first building I viewed on the last day of my tour so I'm super excited to move there and I'm gonna be moving in in the beginning of June so very soon at this point luckily I was able to view the apartment and sign my lease before all of this stuff happened in the world so I got to see it in person signed the lease and everything is all set to go they say they have contactless move-in so I should be able to move in without having to see anybody so I wanted to make this video for you guys to just let you know that I'm moving to Washington DC I'm starting my full time job in the beginning of July so I just wanted to kind of document this experience tell you how my tours went when I toured apartments in DC and then kind of kick off my moving blog series so yeah I'm really excited to move I'm so happy I was able to find the unit for me and it all worked out in the end although it was a little bit stressful but now that I know where I'm living and I'm moving in five weeks five and a half weeks now yeah hope you guys will stick along with me while I go through this process and if you have any questions about touring in DC or if you're planning on moving I would love to hear what you guys are worried about in the comments below because I'm probably worried about the same thing so thank you guys so much for watching I hope this was helpful for you I'm planning on posting two moving vlogs per week to kind of keep you all updated on what's going on and then I plan on doing some work week in my life videos so I hope you'll stick around and thanks for watching
