   okay so this is state two and officially welcome from Brooklyn we just got here it's 9:00 in the morning we're going to Dumbo which is like the most famous part of Brooklyn we're gonna stay here for today probably the street this is this is Washington Street and Water Street it's like those two streets in the middle and you get this view guys I just recovered discovered something that this photo I'm gonna upload it right here this one is behind you it's not the Brooklyn Bridge this is Manhattan Bridge Brooklyn Bridge is over there and what happened breezed over there and this photo was taken over here so Instagram is lying this is not Brooklyn Bridge just to make clear everyone literally everyone was recommending this place the Giuliana's for pizza which is in Dumbo in Brooklyn so they are not even open yet and there is already a queue New Yorkers are saying that this is the best pizza in New York so I'm gonna try it  so we made it to Williamsburg we took a ferry and I thought the fan shop and I wanted to buy some new shoes but I don't know if I can afford it so I just left it but they were so nice and now we are walking through the streets there's this like I feel like I'm in the movie like seriously what do you think guys they don't care about me yeah yeah the subway in New York is like really really smelly it smells like like someone peed in our pool and like a second ago everywhere so I mean we officially made it to Brooklyn great finally  so my friend recommended me if you are living in Manhattan and you want to go to Brooklyn just take a metro I'm in subway and sorry and then from Brooklyn we walk through the Brooklyn Bridge because the view is like you don't have to turn around if you want to see something like the Manhattan skyline and also it's downhill not up here I don't know that's what she said and I listen to her so I'm going I took subway today morning and now we're going back my friend was just talking with his mother and she was saying that all of the flights to Poland are going to be conserved because like all the airports are going to be closed so he's trying to book tickets back to Poland like earlier for tomorrow or Saturday I don't know tomorrow is Friday and I'm like I'm kind of scared because I'm gonna mistake you for another six days and I don't know if they will close airports in UK or Ireland too if they will I don't know what's gonna happen so I'm like seriously this is like this big it's huge I don't know what to think about it I like calm for now or like seriously this is this is like real we are at the Vassar right now this building was like created in 2019 it does nothing but it looks pretty cool tickets are available on the website and they're for free if you're booked there but if you're actually kind of cute without tickets then you have to pay $10 so it looks it looks pretty cool we are on the top of it and it looks it looks pretty cool from from the top  this guy's so cute right now the Sun just came out if like are already Sun setting like setting I mean and but it is so warm in human scientists out and people are I mean the Central Park right now and people are playing basketball volleyball volleyball yeah and it's beautiful in front of the Plaza Hotel which is over there just behind me and then in front of the Apple store on Fifth Avenue honestly I always thought that is classy thing was fake like literally always I thought it was fake it was created about it like computer it is when I got here I was like what the heck it is not fake it is real unlike what I'm shook like seriously like for you I always thought that is fake like forever  it is 20 past 11:00 right now and I'm going to Times Square because I'm three or four minutes like few minutes before midnight every night all of the odds on times where are turning off and there is like an art displaying on the strings so try to see it and see how it looks like yeah it's the 13th of March and it is 500 paces in in New York now it is 20 to midnight on Friday 11 I mean 13th of March they just said in media and that times where is empty that they are closing the stairs but it's not there is actually full of people and the stairs are open it is so bright in here it's like a daytime   so as you can see there was some art there on the screen it was like for three minutes only not even I think it's called the midnight moment every night in Times Square on Times Square in Times Square I don't know but yeah it was really quick and I don't know if it was worth it it was just just like just okay so it's Sunday now is the 15th of March I am in the Greenpoint I just got here about an hour ago I'm supposed to go back to Paul to Ireland on Tuesday but probably Ireland will close the borders and they won't let me in because I'm not Irish citizen so and I was talking actually with Polish in the shop on Greenpoint because this is like a Polish polish part of New York so talking to her she was like just don't go back to Europe because there is like you know and it's what is happening in Europe right now just staying here Trump closed the borders because he knew what he was doing and so yeah basically she said if you have anyone to stay with just just call them ask them whatever and stay with them as long as possible don't go back because here is like it's it's okay in here so now I'm thinking that I should actually stay in here you know so my my stayin here in New York became a huge question mark oh my god you here you can see a Polish flag with the United States flag together it looks beautiful okay so
