 that was ugly hey everybody welcome to my youtube channel it's your girl ife and today i'm back with another video okay um today we're just going to be vlogging a little bit blogging vlogging really and chatting um i have a couple things on my list today that i want to do i want to clean my room clean the cat box wash some clothes what you're doing now i'm going to clean the cap off and i hope you guys can hear me like okay let me see if you can hear me okay i'm back i had to see if you guys could hear me but um let's talk because let's just get the elephant out the room i know it's been like eight months since i recorded i'm sorry um life has been an emotional rollercoaster i'm not gonna lie i just a lot's been going on um so let's start from the beginning i was in school i took this semester off right that right now i took this semester off because i was trying to figure out like what i want to do like i was going to school my major was visual arts to become an art therapist but i'm a very empathetic type of person and i let people probably become my own so i found that it probably wouldn't be the best idea for me to become a therapist you know i mean because like i tend to like harbor people's emotions and let theirs become mine you know and it's like and i knew i wanted to work with art and everything so like i just took early this semester to really think about what i really wanted to do and i wasn't going to go back to school i was just going to um become a flight attendant um stack up my money and invest in stocks and all that stuff and invest invest in property and real estate so i can become a homeowner and like rent out properties and stuff like that but the way like i can't it's doable like i could do that while being a flight attendant but you know i'm like i feel like there's more to my life other than being a flight attendant you know what i mean i say this all the time like i want to try out being a flight attendant don't get me wrong like i think i'm going to do it once in my life just to say i've done it because i've always wanted to do it but i want to have something like a plan a plan b you know what i mean so yeah with that being said that's really what's been going on between the time i stopped recording until now and i really miss making videos and like talking to you guys and engaging with you guys so yeah with that being said this lighting is great that being said let's get started on my rum i should also make this like a vlog like a quarantine vlog because like as we all know um we are going to a really serious pandemic right now the coronavirus and yeah so i've been staying inside the only time i've been going out is to like if i had to do my grandmother's nails or something i go have my grandmother out other than that now or getting animal stuff that i need but other than that i haven't been going out i've been staying my foot in stock so we're going to talk about that later okay so like i said we're going to be chatting um i'm just waiting right now for my clothes to get done but in the meantime i want to talk about things that you could be doing right now to keep you sane during this coronavirus pandemic i'm sorry i'm really trying to find that lighting i feel like i just i look washed out and i don't want to look washed out hopefully that looks good but whatever my cousin braided my hair okay so with that being said on to what i was going to talk about i'm going to give you guys some things that you could be doing right now while you know the toronto virus is happening because a lot of people at the moment are like very they're just stuck at home they're stuck inside can't go out you know it's just like it could be a bummer for someone who stays inside all the time this isn't really that bad like i am a whole lot i'm a homebody so i don't really mind staying inside but for those who aren't a homebody it's like killing them so the first thing that i recommend for you to do is to read a book okay i know like oh my god what but literally you can just get lost in the pages and it's just like you're watching a movie but in a book you know um currently i'm reading the power of your subconscious mind and then this is a really good book and i'm reading this book on scribe i hope i'm saying that right but i'm reading this book on scribe i love this app so much because you can read books magazines articles pdfs and sheet music and so much more on just one app you know what i mean and it's only 10 a month and you also get 30 days free so like if you want to try it out you could try it out for 30 days and then if you like it then it just automatically charges your um card or whatever card information that you put in but it's worth the 10 for me because they have thousands and thousands of books on there probably millions of books and stuff on there that you could read like i said earlier the book i'm reading now is the power of your subconscious mind and it's really good like it's one of those self-help books you know like so i highly recommend this book and if you guys want to check it out then you know check the book out or if you guys want to check the application out you can download it on app um you can download it on the app store or on the play store like either or um but yeah this is not a sponsored video i'm not sponsored by them but i really like the application so you should definitely give it a try yeah so that's the first thing that i've been doing i've been reading another thing that i've been doing is making like these friendship bracelets like they are so freaking cute like i remember i used to make these all the time in camp and i just love them so much you know what it means they're so cute so um you can make some friendship bracelets if you have some um you know laying around or something another thing i've been doing is just making like diy clothing and stuff like i've literally been cutting out my clothes but it's been a fail every single time i think i tried two different outfits and it was just a fail but i will not give up like if you guys want to see a video of me like diying or like you know making my own type of clothing and stuff leave a like leave a comment down below or just vote in that box up there um yeah that's all that's really much a lot of fun another thing i've been doing too is i've been on pinterest pinterest is literally my best friend because like i believe in vision boards and stuff like that so what i've been doing is like making like a vision board on pinterest and if you guys you know like as you can see here i just have a bunch of different boards and stuff pinned to a whole bunch of different boards so i just really love pinterest and how fun it is and you know it makes your like creativity it really brings out your creativity and like what you want to see you know so it's really cool um another thing that i've been doing was keeping my room clean surprisingly like i normally my room has been when i was younger i want to say like my room would stay like ah like sometimes it'll be clean sometimes it'll be dirty but like my room has been like staying clean like i've been really trying to keep it clean because i'm here all the time so there's really no excuse for it to be dirty you know what i mean so i've been keeping my room clean and that's been keeping me like mentally like kind of okay you know what i mean like if my room is clean then i'm like okay you know so i just really keeping my room clean and like yeah that really helps you know the mental another thing i've been doing was binge watching game of thrones but yeah i've just been watching game of thrones and i literally finished it and i'm not very happy with the ending um go vote are you happy with the ending leave a comment down below like i don't i don't know the ending really was like what like what's going on come on you know which banner do you represent please vote not vote but comment down below comment down below which banner you represent because this will determine if i message you or not you know like but um yeah so i really love the game of thrones that show is so good if you haven't watched it go watch it highly recommend not just the ending was just like okay really now like um what's another thing i've been doing that's pretty much it like i literally like i kept do i keep doing those things that i listed like over and over again and it's really been just keeping me busy and i also been sleeping a lot like i just i'm sleeping in but i think it's very important to have a balance like don't just sleep without this whole thing like you can if you want but i think it's smart to like at least pick up a book you know what i mean at least read something feed your brain don't just stay on your phone and like it's hard it's easier said than done because that's what i've been doing the past like week just really just laying in my bed staying on my phone being like a slouch or whatever but like try to read like here and there i'll pick up my book and like read a couple pages and stuff but like really try to feed your brain you know it's very important um so yeah that's just really what i've been doing oh i wanted to tell you guys about this decluttering app this is like also what i did yesterday um you have times why not declutter your photo album you know so there's this app it's called what is it called declutter i think it's called declutter or something but it's gonna be a picture right here somewhere on the screen but you're gonna see it and you can it you literally give it access to your camera roll and it declutters your camera roll um you could pay for the full version which is like three dollars i paid for it because three dollars like what but it's worth it because if you pay for the full version you can literally select like it like i'm gonna show you what i mean i guess i don't know if i can because i already decluttered it but like you could select multiple like pictures at once and then it like deletes them you know what i mean instead of going one by one by one like i don't know how to explain it but if you download the app you know what i'm talking about you know but i highly recommend it like it's really good really really really good and all the stuff that i am talking about will be listed in my description box because like you guys just click there easily if i could find the link if i can then you just have to look it up okay so yeah that's pretty much all i've been doing during this quarantine you know during this pandemic that's really all i've been doing i've been um really motivated to make more youtube videos because there's no reason why i shouldn't be making any youtube videos like i'm home doing nothing you know so yeah with that being said i guess this is the end of the video i don't really have nothing else to talk about i just wanted this video to be out there so i can just let you guys know like where i've been once again where i've been what i've been doing during this pandemic you know what i mean and you know yeah so i want to thank you guys so
