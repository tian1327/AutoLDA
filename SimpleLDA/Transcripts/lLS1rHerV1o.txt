  good morning it's no it's not Friday it's Sunday the 9th of red shirts and I don't quote me on that I think it's the night the 9th of February is our last morning I think our last full day here today we've got half a day there abouts tomorrow is our last full day today we've had a bit of a later start today because we already know what we're doing this morning we'll go straight to top of the rock which doesn't open until 8 a.m. anyway and it's about ice just after 8 a.m. now so we're gonna head on up there only about two 10 minute walk it's lovely this morning we've got Sun and clouds this morning so it's good weather good weather for going up I last night my leg realized was quite swollen had to rest it up on pillows I had to put ice packs on it really no idea what I've done to it really no idea just the bottom of my leg I'm sure it's still called the shin bottom bottom part of my shin before it goes into ankle then what I've done to it but it's very sore it's very painful at times I've ended up having to put my flight socks my compression socks on today that will hopefully stop it swelling up even more and wear my boot a little bit looser see if that helps at the moment it feels feels ok but let's see how that how it feels later because as well as top of the rock we're then going to do the vessel which is a building which is entirely made of stairs it's sort of outdoors but it's entirely made of stairs and there are 2,500 steps to the top so what my leg will be like after that who knows after that we've got 2 options we've entered the Broadway lottery for the last time we entered it last night for tickets for wicked tonight at 7 p.m. chances always winning slim like I said before we're very lucky to have one the wolfes with The Lion King tickets but with all them enter again if we do win small chance we win we'll go and watch that otherwise the plan is later on to go to Staten Island on the ferryboat there are some outlet shops over there so we're gonna go and have a wander over there have a look run those and then come back after it's dark and that way we'll get a nice view of the Manhattan skyline all the top at night which is something we've not really seen we had planned to go on like a harbor lights river cruise which sounds really lovely however we didn't realize that that doesn't actually run from the end of December until I think it's March the fifth due to incase this ice in the water and so on like that so that's actually wrong but this will be another way of getting to see that and the Staten Island ferry boat is free anyway so not sure what we're gonna do yet all depends on whether we get those tickets or not but first things first the sun's out we've got a bit of Sun you can see on the building over there you can see the sun shining on that building so we're gonna go it's not raining which is great for our very last day because it has got raining out tomorrow for a partial day here there so we're gonna get going off to the top of the rock super super quiet here today not seeing that this quiet this time in the morning we probably cuz it's early marble because it's Sunday   being away with my leg quite a good rhythm going with Malak now look there's top of the rock a lovely clear sky for anyway I think we've picked her it's a good morning for it        lustful there are no more fools are there it's cold up here she'll be it  five to eleven oh we've just got back to our rooms for a quick pit stop just to collect my charger for my phone because we're about again now and I don't want to run out of phone juice like I did yesterday when I went to Central Park finish till put top of the rock I was very very impressed with it out of all the three towers that we've been up the one-world Observatory then Pi State Building and top of the rock I would say I'd put top of the rock down at the bottom on my list I don't know why I just didn't think it was gonna be as good as the others but it was it was really good and I'm glad we decided to go up in the daytime so that we could see central park because I think a night would have just seen a few doctored lights in it and the fact that it was a lot darker than the rest of the city I really enjoyed it till there didn't you yeah it was really good up there really good we have so far toward what so far we have say been lucky and just planned everything right going to all these various things because it's been so quiet it was really really quite wide to the top of the rock this morning and it always starts to get busy as we were just getting ready to leave and I think it's because we purposely chose to go to these things early in the morning to get all get out even before I've had breakfast and go and get them and get them done especially if it's been a clear morning it was it was pretty clear with some lovely clouds just a few clouds in the sky so we've planned it spot on so we're just gonna get stuff together again and now we're heading off on the subway just had a bit of breakfast at Dunkin Donuts now we're heading off on the way to the vessel of Hudson Yards at the moment my leg feels ok but we've got I think it's either two thousand five hundred or two thousand seven hundred steps to go up so this could be interesting after we've been up and down these steps oh how are you going to actual X you don't like hi it's not all open I'm sorry let's go    so also we've been the fault  my legs absolutely behind actually doesn't feel like climbing that when you stared this is different levels standard photos and on each level put some room back
