 me that's tell you're still going at it yeah it's the world yeah he's not gonna win this one you filming the vlog all right hello wrestling fans and beer drinkers of the world it is me the beer city bruiser your favorite toothless wrestler and today is a special day because today is national beer day I mean what greater day in the world the national beer day all beer drinkers rejoice and that's going to take me into the beer of the day because I don't want to wait any longer I've been drinking all day long I have a special one and I didn't ride yet it's called a Lord James we heavy scotch ale buy a whole hog now from what the nag wife tells me is a they brew these and the scotch barrels or something like this yeah and Harley was a big scotch drinker so hopefully it tastes good so let's go to try oh that is good that's real good reminds me of ah Mitch from Oklahoma City he used to take me to breweries out there at Oklahoma in Tulsa actually and uh take me to a different local brewery there and they had a scotch ale that was really good so Mitch Baxter if you're watching Shoto t-shirt of the day Skeletor Eternia Jim 1983 now growing up I was a biggie man fan I had all the action for years I had the cartoons I remember GI Joe he-man tangerine ninja turtles alright same time so when I saw this shirt I had to pick it up it just sucks that all the gyms are closed and as you can see I'm nice and sweats cuz I got a homework going in here at the bruiser compound it wasn't the same but you got it you got to stay fit in these times you know what I mean and someday I'll be back in that ring and I want to be in shape more than round I'll never be a body guy but at least be in semi decent shape so let's see we should tell a story of the day shortly huh I think so well since I'm drinking a scotch a lot you share a Harley story like I said before Harley was a big big big scotch drinker and when we used to train down by Harley he used to bring legends in all the time to the shows and they would do autograph signings and stuff like that because Harley was boys with them well one particular time Terry Funk came into Eldon Missouri now Terry Funk was the coolest guy I don't know the whole time he was there he's there for at all three days and the whole time he kept trying to tell me to shave my head and I kept telling like Jara Terry I can't can't shave my head if you look God's doing it for me and he's like no come on kid shave your head and I just I wasn't gonna do it whole time he's there so one particular night after the show is all done we go to this place called buzzers now Missouri that's where all of us used to hang out because they used to take wrestlers real nice so they'd always give us beer discounts and stuff and since I just moved from Milwaukee to Missouri Missouri obviously is a big Budweiser town city state state county state state and maybe from Milwaukee I don't like bud I I'm sorry for all your blood drinkers alter but I just I can't do it I can't do Budweiser candy Bud Light can't do Bud select and if you drink Seltzer stuff and that's what's causing Co vyd I think okay sorry anyways back to my story so Terry had told me hey I don't like Bud either but I love Coors Light if you had Coors Light I said no he goes well little secret if it's brewed by the Miller Brewing Company back in Milwaukee and that's the story of how I started drinking Coors Light that it's part of the story so anyways drinking a bucket of Coors Light with Terry Funk and Harley Race BG and Terry's wife get up and they leave let the boys be the boys they're going home well that moment Harley and Terry turned into like four-year-olds and just start giggling I'm like what's going on so Terry convinces me and buzzers they had two levels and upper level and a lower level the upper levels were all the dartboard the stuff were put on the lower levels where they kept the buckets of darts somehow Terry got ahold of these darts so he convinced me through a lot of beer to take the darts and throw them at the people up on the upper balcony so here's me Terry Funk and Harley Race throwing darts at people on the upper bulky and every time to turn on we just go back to sitting down drinking our beer look around nothing going on and just kept doing it and they kept giggling and the last time I saw Terry he swore he was gonna shave my head not last time in Missouri the last time I saw me swore shaved my head you fast forward a couple years and we're at the CAC in Vegas and my wife and she'd heard the stories of Terry Funk and all that but she didn't really truly believe it first thing Terry does give me a big hug and go you haven't shaved your head yet kid and she goes it's true and walks away so that's my story about Terry Funk wanted me to shave my head we threw darts at people and that's why I drink Coors Light so I hope you enjoy these vlogs I hope they're helping you guys through this time of need everyone please drink
