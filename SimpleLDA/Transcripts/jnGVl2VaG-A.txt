 good morning fellow social distances today is day eight of our self quarantine we're really bored but we're doing good everybody is healthy and that's all that really matters right now today I'm just gonna bring you along my day to day and that's probably what's gonna be happening for the next couple of weeks I was thinking if you guys are bored like me at home you've been watching a lot of YouTube lately so I'm thinking about posting Monday Wednesday and Friday and maybe even a bonus video some weeks hold them II think shouldn't give me some us a bonus video on Sundays so stay tuned for that and make sure you subscribe the day is Saturday so the kids are not gonna have any school curriculum today which I am very excited about for those of you who don't know I live in New York City we are in the borough of Brooklyn and our borough has the highest amount of cases right now so I've been staying inside because I am compromised with underlying conditions I have MS and I also have ITP which doesn't help my immune system at all it takes me weeks just to get rid of a cold so Daniels been the only one going outside he actually went to Aldi I'll show you guys a haul in a bit but he's also one of those workers that are essential right now he manages a grocery store and poor thing has been working overnight getting double trucks to make sure that they have everything so that when people come shop they're not running out so he's been doing that all week and sleeping all day so it's just in me I feel like a single parent and I know a lot of you are and honestly hats off to you guys because I am exhausted today's breakfast cocaine's of eggs french toast sticks and sausage Daniel comes home starving because he works all night and he doesn't take a break cute montage you don't forget your first love we were young and wild we were born don't forget that summer Sun 2009 we were feeling high and drunk for the first  i'ma give you a quick oldies haul everything you see up here was $35 when I went to get groceries the first time I really didn't focus on the snack items so that's what we've been missing so I asked Daniel to pick up some things before he came home from work we got some blueberry muffins we absolutely love these for the morning time Daniel wanted to try these chocolate chip muffins so he picked up those these chocolate chip cookies from Aldi's are absolutely amazing if you have out these nearby and you see these definitely pick them up and try them they are the softest most amazing thing and the cookie - chocolate chip ratio is on point we got some mugs out over here this is my guilty pleasure so he picked it up for me I didn't even ask for it he's so sweet I got some chocolate chip cookie dough I see ice cream for brownies Danielle's been asking for brownies for the longest time now so I'm gonna make him some we got some french toast sticks for the morning time for the boys they absolutely love those we got some salami this is just like a quick option for like me in the morning time and we also snack on this a lot and then two bags of cooked shrimp I've been dying for seafood and I really wanted to go to like a seafood boil place but all the restaurants are closed so I'm think if I could get my hands on a little bit more seafood we will do a seafood boil at home so yeah that's everything we got and again all of that was look at me I'm with lunch time it's about three o'clock and Daniel just picked up our to-go order at White Castle oh my god who else is gonna be out of quarantine at least fifteen pounds heavier because I know I definitely you alright I want to show you guys one last thing before I close out the video for the day I just heard that they're gonna close down all the nail salons any unnecessary business that's um open still it's gonna be shut down I heard that about two days ago so I got my nails done right before vacation it's not focusing oh yeah so I got them done right before vacation as you can see my toenail polish already tipped so for the last couple days I've been doing shopping spree so I'm Amazon but one of the things that I did pick up was this models own gel nail polish I also got the top coat the bottom coat and a matte top coat with the lamp and we're gonna do some DIY gel manicures until this whole thing blows over I'm really excited about that I'm also pretty darn scared that I'm gonna mess it up and not be able to take it off if you guys do your own gel manicures at home leave some tips in the comments below what to do what not to do I know I need to do like thin layers of it but as far as that that's it um I also have a whole bunch of packages waiting to open in the front honestly don't even remember what I was ordering but it's a lot so I'll probably open them on camera next video make sure you stay tuned for that make sure you subscribe comment below and thumbs up this video if you liked it and I'll see you guys in my next one bye
