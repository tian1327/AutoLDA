 hi everyone welcome back to my channel I look crazy right now but this is a raw bro unedited me today is Saturday May 30th 2020 I have been going through it today not decided but is yesterday and the day before that this whole week to be honest there's a lot going on in the world there's a lot of evil in this world a lot of evil directed to black people in this world black men black women black trans people like other people in the LGBTQ community and it really just gets me down because this has been going on forever before I was born before my parents were born before my grandparents were born and it's exhausting it's physically and mentally exhausting and I'm just fed up at this point I really am at a loss for words I've cried all the tears I can cry made all the post I can make I've donated to bailout funds for protesters and other organizations that I know will do good things but in my head I'm just like when will this end and as someone that does want children in that future I mean well I have to have these same conversations with my children and my children with their grandchildren if they have children and it's just it's just physically exhausting to always think about that and then also we're in the middle of a pandemic so you're adding that on top of everything that's going on everything that's been going on within the black community dealing with racist individuals that and other individuals who just don't see us as human and then you have the normal stresses of work if I am blessed and I still have a job but the job is very stressful at this time because I am in healthcare field so everything has just been hell for think I fell like recently I've been going through a quarterlife crisis that's another one videos to those four things by good thing being away from my family I live alone now so I don't have any roommates anyone around me to kind of bounce these ideas off in person so I would say those five things have really just been knocking me down in the simplest simplest way to put it but anyway I say all that to say I was trying to think of where I want my next video to be no idea I think I'm just going to show you kind of what New York City is like in this time of quarantine it is Saturday but I need to go and to work to take care of a few things I'm also getting serology testing just because I'm curious even though a report came out a couple of days ago that it's not the most accurate test but I still just want to get it it's free offered by my job and so I figured if I'm going up there anyway I might as well just take care of a few things that I need to take care of in person so I'm gonna take you along with me I'll show you a little bit of like what the subways are looking like what the street is looking like and I think that just for my own mental health I may take a blanket or something to the park and just read a book maybe take some wine in a cup I don't know I just need to do something yesterday and the day before I took like hour-long walks just because I just need I just need to find a way to clear my mind I really need a therapist today I've been avoiding it for years but I really really think that I could benefit from therapy what I really want to do is just scream at the top of my lungs because I'm that frustrated but where am I gonna do that where people won't think that I'm crazy where can I go and just destroy something and scream at to talk to my lungs and not have people wondering if I'm dying and not have them call the police on me because they think that I'm dying in my apartment where can I do that let me know what you think about this whole situation going on in America with the pandemic with the protest with anything just talk to you girl because I've been going through it okay I'll see you in a little bit so this is what we're giving today technically off so I can't be bothered excuse the boxes in the back you know when you order something it's like fifteen on the box and that comes from one tiny tiny little package and I also couldn't be bothered to get my camera funny style just ahead to work take care so that I can joyless so both train lights were pretty empty I would say maybe there were like four to to four people in my car generally nobody's really riding the subway like that I mean where are they going nothing's open there's not really that much to do besides sitting outside a social distancing so yeah the trains were clean cleaner than I've ever seen them they were empty and everything is she outside was very peaceful there were a lot of people but people were pretty spaced out of course the people that they came with they weren't wearing masks as you can see I pretty much had six feet around me in all directions it was a very nice day outside it was very peaceful I have my book  so no I have a record in a while - so cute so yeah  this is not the neighborhood I live at mrs. Johnson you can see up there hyaline it runs to this neighborhood please don't let me she are really cute so I think the next video I do is going to be some apartments was in Chelsea I did a search yesterday and I was able to find some studios for less than two thousand dollars so I feel like it would be interesting to show I ended up stopping and getting frozen margarita at this place  especially since nothing's open but now like wrestling I'm  this is what I wore my little out excursion I got this junk - along like a lab setup I'm sweating from TJ Maxx or Marshalls widows on the upper left side so I just threw this on went outside sat on my little blankie I got that Margherita it was a successful day I did not sleep that well yesterday so I think I'm gonna take a nap after I take a shower okay I'm gonna make food while food is baking when the shower hopefully eat some food and then take a nap and I'll be back to recap this entire day
