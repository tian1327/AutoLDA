  hello guys quick start to the vlog it is currently 8:30 and we are picking up the moving truck its I'm so grateful is driving it for me so I don't have to drive it oh it's Monday I don't know if I said that I also hope you guys can hear me - it's loud oh yeah we're getting the truck about to start packing everything up so it is ready for the move I just wanted to check in wash a bunch of clothes with this road and not in picking blue lint off or anything but yes good morning guys it is 7:41 a.m. I'm headed out to go to Duncan to get some coffee and I'm probably gonna swing by McDonald's to get actual breakfast because Duncan breakfast a little expensive but we'll see holding the line cuz I might say listen get in the line and be like I don't feel like going all the way to Duncan so I mean McDonald's even though it's literally not right there but it's not like it's like that far of a drive and sometime this week I need to go to the beauty supply and get my lip gloss because this is the only thing that nourishes my lip all the topstick I have in my house don't do for me alright let's go it's moving day yay the leasing office opens at 9:00 a.m. I don't know if my boyfriend's going to want to get that out early because he seems really tired but yeah I'm gonna drive now so how much hang out off and BSA we are home we don't finish eating breakfast and we're about to get dressed to head out to pick up the keys but let me show now what the apartment is looking like right now the kitchen we have lots of trash that we're accumulating there's like three open trash bags I need to do better so much that and then this is what it looks like over here and then in here so we have the truck all packed up and stuff and then we're gonna drop the TVs in blankets because I didn't feel like spending any more money on bubble wrap it was kind of a waste to $27.00 shot so yeah it's so weird in here and I'm glad that we have like two weeks to clean it because child there's some stains in here it's weird in here it's like the apartment actually seems kind of smaller with no furniture in it yeah I saw longus I can't believe but we made it we made it very big so let me show us you guys we already did our walkthrough and stuff so yeah you walk in here's a laundry room here's an extra little linen closet and then have a second the guest bathroom and the guest bedroom which is a nice size and everything and then this is a quick tour obviously the little dining room nook then we have the kitchen over here it's so pretty and I like this I forgot what this style of like setting up the kitchen is but it makes the kitchen feel larger than it is and I really like that and then the living room here I'm trying to not show you guys my windows you don't see throne and then here's the bedroom I feel like here look the other way I feel like the one that we saw had a bigger bedroom so I'm a little concerned about our bed fitting in here because the bit the bedroom is a smaller model we saw I feel like was definitely bigger but we're gonna see how it all fits and then there's the bathroom it looks like this very cute the shower  and the closet there's like hawks their enemies box back there unless they're shopping and then there's me hello so yeah it's time to start moving essentially so we are trying to build the furniture now I'm talking to the wall we're trying to build the furniture but we need screwdrivers so I'm gonna have to go back to the old apartment because we didn't bring any tools with us I can always start putting clothes away in the closet and kitchen stuff I can do that can I do that while you go get tools what do I need to come with you with what I can do something here   in the second bedroom I just finished building the nightstands which are a lot bigger than I thought they were gonna be they're kind of massive and I don't know how I feel about that but like really now it's cool I have to see how it looks next to the bed and I guess it's kind of good cuz I thought they were gonna be really tiny and I was like mm hmm looks like kind of a pleasant surprise but now I'm gonna build my desk I was gonna build a CV Sam but it's like we don't even have a TV in here we're not gonna have internet till Thursday so there's no rush on that but me getting my desk set up kind of important to me so let me go get the other boxes  I had originally wanted to not have my back against the wall with my does sorry obviously other people or building stuff but this desk is so large but I feel like it doesn't work and I have to put it against someone but wall over here for it work and it's like do I put it against the window or do I put it against this wall I feel like I know I should put it against the window for like filming purposes and everything plus I hate doing my makeup like in the middle of the day and the light is coming through the side because then it makes your face look different wow this is really big which is exactly what I wanted but in this space it's a little overpowering so I'm gonna put it against the window for now and then what do we really figure out what we're doing with the second bedroom I will change it accordingly oh let's move the heavy access hmm I don't like how much further the tabletop comes out past the desk I think I'm gonna move I mean past Allah Alex Josh I think I'm gonna move the Alex jar for it cuz I don't like the way that looks I feel like that should be that looks so much better I think now we're gonna go grocery shopping I wasn't trying to finish up what he's doing so I'm gonna let him finish that I'm gonna pick up all this crap home whenever in trash bags put all of this trash inside the box but yeah it looks so good yeah it looks so much better against the window or sorry it looks so much better against the window if I put it in like the way I wanted to that means I'm like claiming the whole room for this desk and I don't think I should do that yet so so to her but it it was worth it it is currently um by the way so and for instance if I'm supposed to get here on 6:30 so should actually probably go grocery shopping like now alright hello guys it is currently I don't know with my phone oh hey Siri where are you all right so that's a little long there's currently 7 o'clock Fritz just got here and he and my boyfriend are currently throwing out the couches we decided not to keep them because we're gonna put them in a second bedroom but a really tight fit and then we like maybe we just keep one and then we just decided not to which stinks a little bit but you know it is what it is so they're really good conditions so that's why it kind of stinks but yeah so I started unpacking the kitchen this we don't have any pantry space for the first time in my adult life my life period I've literally always had a pantry I don't have a pantry so this is different for me but we're just using this side why is it so blurry there you go so we're just going to use this side for food so up here we have the seasonings on these two shelves I don't think that this is gonna stay up here but I'm putting it there for now we have all our breads the seasonings the cans peanut butter stuff like that and then like our protein powders and stuff the coffee that we're trying to finish out and that like sugar flour and stuffing stuff that doesn't really get used as much and then the bigger stuff down here so like the boxes and then I put the potatoes the rice and the onions down in here so yeah that's what that is looking like and then I would you put the silverware away I don't have any dividers right now and I'm gonna take some time to find some some right now just like a cluttered mess like that fine now I'm just gonna work on this box with the pots and pans so yeah I'm starving we literally haven't eaten since this morning the McDonald's we just have like a mini bag of Talkies but we thought we were getting dinner for a Taylor and Fritz for helping us out what Taylor didn't come and for a test I leave to go do homework so he's just gonna help us out real quick then he has to go so we're probably just gonna get our own dinner I'm feeling like I want some Wawa and it's like literally so close I'm gonna put this stuff away also you could get like the this was like vitamins and you know cold medicine and stuff okay I have to put that away I just don't know where to put it because before I was keeping it in the cabinet in the kitchen but I feel like it makes more sense to go in like a medicine cabinet in the bathroom I think I'm gonna do that I may put in a second bathroom  ten o'clock it's Wednesday my camera died yesterday while I was filming and then we actually got so much stuff done but yeah did I show you what let me show you what's happened so there's my desk I'm still trying to clear everything and have everything put away my boyfriend to us to go over here and then this happened today I just set up the bookshelf which I thought was brown so originally I had wanted to paint it white but it's black so it fits with the decor so I have all the books in there and stuff and then today I also put my schoolbooks in here and then like my filming equipment and then zoomed in and then we also built the TV stand for the living room and me both a dresser which I will show to you tomorrow and work I can't show you the TV stand right now excuse the background eyes because my work I was watching something but here's the dresser looks good we have like a huge misshapen hair yesterday well basically realize that we were putting it together backwards so that was fun I'm in the bathroom we went to we went to raw today and we just picked up this laundry basket it's really cute and we picked up these what is spilling which feels I'll figure it out yeah and then we picked up these to put the soap in so right now we picked up a bunch of stuff from the apartment the old apartment so that's why there's like it's like we clean up so much yesterday and then we brought with just stuff in the apartment here just now also yeah I'm gonna take all of this hair skin products and stuff I'll put on the counter and then put the dirty clothes because we got okay folks I need to get what I decided to do this is not very cute but I'm gonna get like one of those cute little trays and put everything on it but right now this works and there's like tons of counter space like literally so much counter space so I can do this where before like the product Stephanie had to be put away and then this needs to go in the shower but I'm going to clean it first we just change out the showerhead when the cleanest I can take a shower because that's just what you're supposed to do  it's a love it a I'm gonna call it I'm gonna go to bed and I will see you guys tomorrow
