 every one day five of the vlog that we're doing here to stay connected to one another as we're practicing physical distancing social distancing in light of the pandemic but also seeking to be in God's Word to be relationally and spiritually close as a church family and to dig into God's promises to hold fast of them in the midst of all of the trouble that's around yesterday I started talking about a section of Matthew 6 where Jesus tells his disciples how to pray and I think not only does he teach us how to pray but he also gives us words not flowery words like he warns about what the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who like to use flowery fancy words and beautiful poetic expressions of truth to pray to God in hopes that they'd be better heard but he gives them a simple set of petitions of simple prayers that anybody can say and expand upon as well you can say one of these petitions and think about your life and how that petition applies to you and you can write a beautiful prayer in your own heart or on paper however you want to do it that very well speaks to that so this is Matthew 6 9 through 15 it looks like here release this gives the Lord's Prayer and this is how the Christian Standard Bible puts it Jesus tells his disciples therefore you should pray like this our Father in heaven your name be honored as Holy your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us today our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors and do not bring us into temptation but deliver us from the evil one for if you forgive others their offenses your heavenly Father will forgive you as well but if you don't forgive others your father will not forgive your offenses now a lot that we could say about this passage that it's so tightly packed and there's a reason for that because Jesus knew that if we learn this prayer that each of these petitions would be a great jumping-off point for all sorts of prayers that we're going to come back to in our lives thy will be done is one of the most powerful and also one of the most dangerous prayers that we can pray because we're putting ourselves in God's hands and I think that continues to be a great petition to pray in the midst of a lot of sickness and suffering and uncertainty thy will be done and we know that it will be when we think about praying that for ourselves we can say now how does this apply to my life how is God's will being done or how could it be done in my own life am i paying attention to the book of God's Word and to the book of my own life and putting the two together how do I apply that also I just wanted to point out you notice that this whole discussion of Jesus about the Lord's Prayer is kind of finished up with this conversation about forgiveness and I've always remarked that that the idea of forgiveness is one of the central pieces of the Lord's Prayer that in order to be in order to be the people that God intends us to be to lean into that identity then we have to live a forgiven life not just being forgiven people but also forgiving those around us as we first been forgiven so just a little reflection for you from God's Word I also wanted to give you a little window into the joining Jesus book we continue to take a look at this as we go along get that on the right side joining Jesus on his mission Craig Finke I'm pastor Finke posted a beautiful post he just the other day I posted on Facebook you got a reading because it says a lot about how we're walking through these times together and how God is maybe nudging us a little bit messing with us encouraging us to be the church that he's always intended us to be that looks a little bit more like the house churches of Acts 8 and you can read that I'll post it in the in the details below but I wanted to read you just a little section of this from chapter 3 so we're talking about the river moved and how our culture has maybe moved on from churchianity so to speak the organized church but the church on mission is always going to remain and so this is what pinky says on page 42 he says consider this the u.s. culture although remarkably unchurched these days is also becoming uniquely ripe for the church to be the church again what our culture is longing for is actually well within our sweet spot as Jesus followers our culture may no longer be interest in churchianity but without even knowing it they are uniquely ready for biblical Christianity they are looking for what Jesus has already called his followers to be so as we continue to journey through this time of gathering around our table spaces and our temple space being a little bit more dormant how is God calling you to lean into some of those relationships to love your neighbors even while you can't be in close contact with them and how can that be a beautiful expression of the church that mirrors how it all got started if you need more expressions of that look at the book of Acts it is littered with beautiful stories of people gathering in the midst of difficult situations and persecution and the gospel the love of God shown to us through Jesus on the cross is the thing that always binds us together so that's all I got for you for today this will be the last vlog for this week I'll catch you guys on Monday if you're seeing this that tells me that you're in the places where you're probably gonna find our weekly or weekend worship service here in a little bit we're gonna be posting something on on YouTube and Facebook that'll be like a playlist of a few different things and again it's not like being together in God's house but I hope that is something that kind of brings us around God's Word and teaches us to be the church well we're kind of quarantined off so on until next week stay in the word be well look out for your neighbors those who are around you and I'll see you next week God's peace to you pastor out
