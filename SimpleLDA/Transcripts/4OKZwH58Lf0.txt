  hi guys good morning I just went to Starbucks I got a venti iced white mocha quad so there's four shots in it almond milk no it so good today's Monday March 23rd so I have three classes today have a pretty decent amount of homework to do as well my plan right now though is I'm gonna go home work out I think I want to do like a little bit of a leg workout and then shower get ready and then start doing my classes all right now I need to go and get gas because I want to run i money and like below E so it's also like hailing right now so if you can hear that okay I'm gonna go get gas and then go back do a little workout shower and I'll check in with you guys okay I'm out of the shower now so I just use two pumps of hair serum before I brush my hair out I just like work it through my hands I love this stuff ever since I started using it I have to use it every time I wash my hair I don't know I just love the function of beauty products honestly I'm gonna moisturize my face so like I said earlier it's Monday I've been home in New York for about a week now if you guys are not familiar I go to school in Michigan I go to Michigan State and honestly this whole adjustment of being home due to the virus and having classes online and basically everything is the exact same as it would be at school just that I don't have to physically go to class and I do it online um it's definitely a big adjustment and it's kind of been hard for me because you know normally when I'm home I'm not in the mode of school or like college because it's not college so I constantly I'm like forgetting things that I need to do I'm kind of just like a little bit of a mess and you guys know I love a Google Calendar usually I don't have a physical planner I solely use Google Calendar for everything YouTube school everything but I think because I'm home and just because of like the circumstances of what you know like life is right now I think I need to have a physical planner so I started filling that out yesterday just like all my assignments and things I need to do for the rest of the semester so now all my school stuff is in that planner I'll just keep a little calendar for everything else because I'm home 24/7 now so I need to like find some sort of separation even if it's something small like a physical planner and Google Calendar I have a big laundry basket of clothes that I need to fold so I think I'm gonna do my lecture for my one class my ieh class it's kind of like a humanities class um well I fold my laundry so  okay so this is a planner I've been using just till I keep my school stuff separate from like everything else just because being home like I said it's been getting overwhelming so these are the assignments that I need to do today I'm just things like this is a book that I need to read a quiz I have to do this chapter I usually just go through and write this out as the day's go but these are just the actual assignments that are due but I have to remember to go on and watch and take notes on all my lectures that my professors upload so right now I think I'm just gonna do chapter nine point one for my abnormal psych class take some notes on it and give you guys a little montage I just made myself a little bit of lunch I have my big water this is actually a bkr water bottle I'll link it down below for you guys and it has like a rubber exterior but I just took that off and I've just been using it as like a big last one and then I just made like a little turkey sandwich and then I just cut up five strawberries if I'm still hungry after this I might go downstairs and get some more fruit but I'm just gonna relax and eat lunch take a break I really love watching true crime so maybe I'll put oh yeah I was watching this earlier umm so actually I'll probably just continue watching this or Keaton Milburn if you know that is put a bunch of recommendations of true crime documentaries on her Instagram story so I might go look at those and throw one on but yeah I'm just gonna relax this and then I will check back anything is  number will be monitored and recorded by pure floor let me say Christmas Eve so I started doing some online shopping being in the house all day I like find myself just bored and going online shopping a lot of times I online shop but I just like add things to my car and never like check out my the only one that does that I don't really know why but it's something I've always done but so I'm just gonna order some things some shirts shorts sunglasses and I can show you guys these things in a vlog once I get them I also just ordered an adult coloring book from Amazon so I can show you guys that as well I'm also watching one of Caitlyn's videos I love her videos I love her videos especially since she's done iPad notes cuz that makes me want to get an iPad take notes on it but she's about to hit 50k so go subscribe to her if you guys aren't subscribed you need to be subscribed to her IIC if you like our videos are very very similar we make a similar kind of content you know college related it's also Michigan State related so it's very similar a lot of times what I like to do is put on a video or a podcast and tell myself that like a certain task that I have to do before it's over so obviously a podcast is a lot longer of a time but like a video like her video is 10 minutes 13 minutes so I'm just gonna like tidy up a little bit while I watch that and yeah I just got some new products in the mail show you guys just like some skincare things so it's from this brand called Bay body and my mom actually uses this so all their products have like retinol in them which is really good for anti-aging and preventing wrinkles because something that I want to do is like get on top of anti-aging stuff now it's a lot better to do preventative measures than to try and like reverse wrinkles and aging once it's already done so so I got this neck cream this is a retinol serum with vitamin E just a moisturizer and then I also picked up this i jo I actually ordered all this stuff online but once I do use them I will let you guys know my thoughts and opinions on them after I've honestly spent majority of the day just like studying getting myself together getting ready for the week having online classes I'm still adjusting honestly maybe next video I can give you guys on my tips of transitioning to online classes for the rest of the semester I know Michigan State right now is the faculty and like board I guess is discussing going to pass/fail meaning we won't individually have like grades like we normally would it would just be week they're passed the class or failed the class and that's how it would show up which oh my god I'm crossing my fingers like I want that to happen so bad you guys this whole thing just like really sucks and it's a lot harder than you would think it is not easier it's harder in so many ways so that would be awesome but I let you guys mama and scribe my Instagram is just a perk Titus that I was ending off today's video with a QA so I'm gonna answer some of those questions where do you want to live after college so I honestly don't really have a plan for after college right now I kind of need to because I'm about to be a junior this fall I would really love to live in Boston for a little while that's like my favorite city I just have the best memories from when I was younger and my parents sister and I going to Boston and it was just awesome I just love it there so much it's just like a cleaner and nicer New York so maybe living in Boston maybe living somewhere warm maybe New York City I don't really know my plan is definitely to move somewhere that I've never been more like maybe I've been there but I haven't like lives there I don't plan on coming home after college but you know like things change and maybe I have certain job opportunities here or somewhere else so it almost depends I don't know I'm actually curious what you guys would want to do like what's your plan if you have a plan for later in life or when you're done with college let me know what other podcasts do you recommend Katelyn actually asked this question I told her to watch the skinny confidential last summer and she still says she listens to that and she likes it a lot so skinny confidential is a really good one I also listen to gals on the go but I only listen to like select episodes that I think are interesting I really love that I love you so much podcast with Kenzie Elizabeth because that's bye dear media which is the same company that the skinny confidential is under let me know your favorite podcasts down below because I'm always looking for some new ones what keeps you motivated to be productive during Quarantine I am still trying to figure this out you guys I've been someone motivated today it's really really gotten to me I was so unmotivated and I just wanted to lay my bed all day but I just kind of like pushed through and making this video helped me stay motivated honestly but I'm still kind of trying to figure that out I'm gonna be completely honest and not sugarcoat it doing college while being home is just the worst and I hate it so much it's so hard for me to focus and just like be in the mindset of school you know I'm not able to go on campus and like maybe it would be different if I could still go to the library but like everything's closed because of the virus and I just don't know I I just hate it and I'm struggling I'm right there with you guys I feel like we're all kind of in this rut and we're all in the situation together so you know just like if anybody has tips for each other leave them down in the comments and we can all add to them and it take from them you know we will all get through this together I'm still trying to work on that though so I don't know if I have the best advice right now hopefully in the future okay the last question that I'll answer is what foundation do you use so I've been using the same foundation since last summer and I'm obsessed with it it's the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Foundation I'll link it down below for you guys it's so good it also smells really nice that one's amazing I definitely recommend you guys try it I've repurchased it multiple times ten out of ten ok that's it for today's video I hope you guys liked it if you guys like this video
