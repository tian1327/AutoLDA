 I wanna start off this video by saying that I have listed all of the numbers hotlines donation sites GoFundMe petitions that you could sign down below and so far those are all I know at the moment so if you guys have any other petitions please comment them down below and send me the links that would be really appreciated I really want to do as much as I can to help with this obviously I'm learning new information every single day and more and more petitions are coming out so as of right now everything that I put in the description is all my knowledge of how you can help so please if you have other petitions or anything like that that isn't in the description please comment them down below and I lay there in this video I talk about the black lives matter movement so it'd be really appreciated if you just listen to what I had to say I feel inclined to talk about this since I do have a youtube channel even though I don't have like millions and millions of a following it is important to just speak on any platform you have so keep that in mind and I hope you enjoyed the video one more thing I want to say is that I will never be able to understand what a black person goes through on a day-to-day basis I will never know that I am NOT white I am a person of color I'm Asian but obviously Asians are treated to a different and lesser extent than black people are so I will never know what they go through I'm extremely privileged to be in the position where I am I want to say that and that's my last point before you get to the part where I actually talk about this further but I just want to say that  okay so hopefully you guys enjoyed that little montage with me in math class I'm still in math class she told us to work on this problem for two minutes and then we would work on it together as a class obviously I'm not doing that right now because I wanna show you guys something cuz I'm very excited that my idea package came even though I worried one thing but I been or they're doing other thing like the next or two days after you know that's just how my brain works so um I'm going to show you and don't worry my mic and cameras also they can't hear rape is this so awkward do you guys ever just like not like do your class work during class because Sam sorry I'm a bad student this is my first time ordering something from a ritzy ax and I keep seeing all these tick talks about their ERISA hauls and I'm very excited for this shirt because I've been wanting it for a long time and it was on sale so I was like oh my god it was on sale for 50% off so that's like really so good also I just want to talk about how fast the shipping was this shipped out yesterday or the day before and it came today oh no no what it shipped out Tuesday and it came Wednesday and today's Thursday oh she's doing talking and today's Thursday I just got a day later and I actually arrived because they arrived later and I live in apartment I love it and the sticker doesn't rip this package okay so I got this this mock neck shirt I have one like the exact same butts in black and actually I didn't realize that it's slightly different cuz the materials like a it's supposed to be us and my other one is like an eight okay I'm going to rush it go back to me my math class because I should do that so LC goes after oh I forgot I was logging but I had my second-to-last class today it was PE class which is literally the dumbest thing that we have to zoom for that but that's over with it's twelve thirty five I told myself I would do my ab workout after so that's what I'm gonna do but I just in this really cute outfit also my room is so messy so ignore that so I have this top from princess Polly I really like it it's really cute my chokers from brandy my earrings are from cyberspace and my shorts are from forever 21 I'll make some lunch and maybe I'll actually work on stuff one my next class I think it's at 2:40 or something but I've been online shopping like a crazy  if you guys are wondering which I workout I do it's the Pamela Reef one for so long I had been doing like Chloe teens or Alexis friend and both are very good but like this one like really worked for me so this is it hi guys so it's been a few hours later it's 5:05 now so it's getting later yeah yeah I mean yeah obviously but I just wanted to speak about the situation with George Floyd it really just breaks my heart thinking about all the injustice is going on in our country yeah it's just not surprising and that's the problem we all need to do our part just just support George's family as much as we can and fight for the injustice is injustice injustice is that are going on in our country and just spreading awareness I don't think spreading awareness is like the most we can do you know I literally just wrote I wrote them a letter you can do that I'll leave the links to all of the petitions and GoFundMe and any other knowledge I have that you can do to help support this terrible tragedy yes please guys just educate yourselves on all of these tragedies and just be aware like you would literally have to be living under a rock to not be aware of what's going on also think about the many other black lives that were taken oh I have a list of some of the victims which include Brianna Taylor George Floyd almond Arbor II and Christian Cooper obviously that's not the whole list and it can go on just because George Ford is a new case and it's very recent just we also remember the many lives that have been taken in the past and we really we really need to pull through together stand together and fight for this injustice because this is our country and what we do to fight this will affect our future so for any slight chance of hope and just do your part remember everything will be down below if you haven't done anything please do it because really it helps a lot and guys please educate yourselves who have a voice and you should use it for this it's really just not okay to just be neutral about it and you're just equally as much as the oppressor for choosing silence so I'm gonna leave it at that it literally just breaks my heart but and a brighter note I do have a deep hop package that has arrived so I'm gonna show you guys what I got I only got one thing I'm very excited and just remember all of the support links for George will be down in the description also if you haven't watched the video I think you should you should just be aware of what's going on on a more happy on a more joyous note I didn't receive another package from deep hop it's actually my first perk just from deep hop ever so I'm excited let me show you guys I got this flannel you guys might be thinking it's ugly it just is a little bit I did love how this has a denim coloring I meant shut up and wash this I have to do my homework I haven't done any homework today part two I forgot to vlog but obviously it's an item I'm sorry um my eye keeps twitching it's only my left eye which is so strange like I literally don't know what the  is wrong with my eye I think I'm gonna go blind mmm don't really want that but um I really had a tiring night because I discovered that there had been so many fruit flies on my ceiling it's because my light is pointing up so they're like I guess they like the light I'm assuming I'm actually not sure if fruit flies are attracted to light I don't know if that's just me being stupid but like I actually don't know so just take my word on it that they were some type of light oh yeah be definitely like the light because in my bathroom in my bathroom these flies had the audacity to hide up in my light fixture I'm not going to turn on the light because I want them to die so for like the next two days I'm gonna just not turn on that light I taped around the light because there's space there and I taped around it so if they tried to get out they would get stuck from the table then just died so I'm gonna leave that for at least 48 hours but that was I became my own Bob Duncan like I literally killed so many fly then I got so sick of it I kept having to stand on this chair because it was on my ceiling I think it's because during the day I open my window because it's been getting really hot I think that's why the Flies are in there I don't know why else they would be here oh my god I do not want to ever spend like 30 minutes doing that I was so annoying so I have these shorts I've been watching them for awhile and they finally restocked all sizes and this shirt I think is actually really really cute okay so it's the next day it's kind of late again I really am terrible at vlogging I forget every single time but it's 4:00 p.m. now it's Friday I'm being productive and I'm reading what I have to do for history I went on a walk earlier this morning and then got some chick-fil-a for lunch it was really freaking delicious but now I feel a little sick because I drank too much of my little shake huh so I never actually finished vlogging sorry about it but I didn't want this video to go to waste because I had already edited I don't know maybe you
