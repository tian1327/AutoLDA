     you hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be an unedited day in my life I just wanted to be very open and talk with you guys about something as you can tell by the title I will be moving across the country at Durango pandemic so I'm gonna talk about that a little while later and just kind of like my summer plans in general and I wanted to make it unedited so yeah this might be rough to watch but anyways I'm just editing a little bit before I have a call with some of my YouTube friends we're actually gonna be doing a giveaway in June so let's stick around for that I probably mentioned it in like every video way to do it but I'm just really excited and they're such a great group of girls I'm so glad that I met that so anyways I'm just going to edit a vlog that actually already went up you already seen it um and yeah I'm also filming like two other videos this week so I've been trying to like keep track I literally put reminders in my phone but make sure to also come to below different video ideas that you have or like that you want to see I know that a lot of people have been asking for what I eat in a week instead of what I eat in a day I'm trying that out but yeah I just wanted to do these little like unedited one takes and I hope you guys like it forgot that like I can't cut this part out I'm just like watching that cut back because I've never done one of these like unedited videos and I'm just like where's my energy like I'm literally drinking a latte right now and I'm just like um anyway it's time you don't wake up we're about to start our YouTube resume and I've been trying to export this video but it's not working I've literally been on the spot for hours now I'm just working on statistics yay okay so it's like two o'clock I've literally just been sitting on my computer for so long doing my work which I still need later why I'm taking steps right now as a college senior who's not majoring in math I don't know I feel like or like finance I don't know all right so anyway um which it's not good to have been putting up lunch because I'm filming that what a you know week thing and feel like right now oh wait I haven't even started that I'm gonna okay so this is what happens I'm filming like three videos at once I'm not used to this but it's fun and I feel like especially this some of my YouTube friends like that group that I was talking about earlier that zoom call like they've noticed that people that actually like watch their channel they like really appreciate that video so I'm hoping that all of you guys are still watching at this point enjoy these because I can't oh my goodness this is gonna be awful I'm so sorry I want to do more of these in like maybe I'll get used to it but yeah it's just fun like a little bit since I film so it's probably why also I'm probably talking about this in every single video but I got a thermo flask and it's 40 ounces and I was gonna get the hydro floss but like I literally heard that these are these same thing they fit like the same like straw wood and those like boots or whatever oh wait I don't have my boot on and let's just watch it at my house because I have my hands right now but anyways this is so nice because I feel this up like a few times a day and I'm drinking like plenty of water so yeah it's really nice out and I don't want to miss the sunshine so I'm probably gonna go out there soon okay okay this is so random but I just saw recipe for sweet potato toast so I'm gonna try it and I'm trying for my other videos so go check that out  this is crooked anyways um my hair's wet I just got a shower and oh I didn't even say so today's the next day I'm just continuing this because yesterday I didn't get a chance to talk about literally the tone of this video so I'm sorry seeing you so long but I'm gonna sit down right now finish some work and then I will go into all that I feel like all of these clips have just been like oh yeah so I'm gonna talk about this later when is later I know but I'm actually on tripod saying I promise hey guys so finally sitting down to talk about moving across the country and my cyber plans so basically next weekend are actually when you guys are seeing this it'll be like the coming weekend I am flying across the country to Portland Oregon I mentioned in my last video that this was like one of my potential plans this summer and so I understand that a global pandemic is going on right now and flying is not enforced no not recommended but I will be doing about this as safely as I possibly can so what was I saying um like I'm gonna be wearing a face mask and stuff I'll even try to like switch them out as I can so that like I can wash them I'm thinking about gloves I know like somebody mentioned that you can get it through your eyes too so I don't really know what to do about that but basically when I get there I am quarantine with only one other person for a solid two weeks and we've just felt except with the fact that like we might get it which is like kind of not smart but this is like the best way to go about it so yeah I will not be seeing anyone I will try not to even like go to the grocery store or anything like literally after being an airport you don't want to do that so anyways that's my plan that's my disclaimer on that you guys will see some vlogs from Portland which I'm super excited about because it's kind of been my plan for a little bit so I'll be there for approximately like three months but I don't really know what's going on with my fall semester yet so I'll update you guys on that one ever I find out I actually just heard that we might find out in July so anyways so this summer basically what I'm doing I'm not just like a living they're having fun I mean yeah that's part of it but I'm also going to be taking summer classes so I'm basically gonna be done with like most of my senior year classes this summer which is really cool I just finished my junior year and so that way I can take like only grad classes next year and like do my senior project and stuff still but anyways yeah I'm taking a grad class and a couple senior year senior level classes yeah so you guys will be seeing that which is kind of fun if any of you guys are also taking classes this somewhere or whatever and you don't want to see some like productive work flash like school vlogs just like let me know and yeah so basically those are old my updates if you've stuck around to this point in the video thanks so much for watching if you want to see more like unedited days or weeks or weekends in my life I'd love to do them because I mean I don't even have to edit them that's kind of crazy but we'll see if I like anyways thanks so much for watching and I'll see you guys next time
