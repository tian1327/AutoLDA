 hello welcome everyone to our Channel Missy wait XO I am Missy thank you so much for stopping by our Channel and for watching this video today casey is not here with me today he is on the stretch where he's working seven days straight and when he works he does work 12 so we have very little time but I have great news the next video that we release on our channel we're going to talk about our own top 5 unique Disney character meets so he's going to be on the channel I am super excited to even see the video but today what I'm going to share with you is what we got for our birthdays my big 40th birthday was Saturday April the 18th today I'm filming this on the 20th and then Casey's birthday is coming up on the 22nd we went ahead and exchanged all of our gifts and we're looking forward just to sharing some fun and sharing all of them with you and maybe it will give you some ideas of some things that you want to shop for when we're all able to get back out and start shopping again  you guys all know me and you know how much I love Mary Poppins so Elijah got this Mary Poppins ornament for me off of shopped Disney and he was so funny when he gave it to me because he said super soon we're gonna have an all Mary Poppins tree and that would be awesome so he got me this ornament from Disney ink and paint and it is the canvas of the Penguins from Mary Poppins with the frame that's kind of like a little hook there where you can detach it so a little black string there to hang it and then on the back it's just the back side of the canvas so that's what Elijah got me and then he knows how much Casey loves the mandalorian and so he got him this little Star Wars Lego set in what's the really cool thing about this Lego set is all of the little characters that it has it has four of the little Mandalorians and you usually don't get that many of the figures and these you usually just get the one but this one came from four came with four and he got this for him off of Target there's a close-up look of that from the front and then turn it around here on the back and you can see them even a little bit closer so I think Elijah did a really great job of picking out those gifts I know I love mine Casey loves his as well he's like the little kid he's like are you gonna film that video because I want to get my little Mandalorians out and set him on my bookshelf this first one is a set so I'm gonna take him out of here and show them to you these are gonna be really helpful and cute and fun and all of my raid on displays that I've been doing I've been wanting these little guys and he got them for me for my birthday they're from 180 degrees and I am so excited about having them and I cannot wait to show them to you and if you're watching this video and you follow our shop Casey's crochet corner some of the new items that I'm going to be bringing to the shop just like along with these little marshmallow cups so if I have any radon Disney / fans you're definitely going to love what I'm going to have coming to the shop but I'm going to go ahead and take these out and show you all four of them that are in here in the set there's the first little one and they're open on the top so you can put little marshmallows in there I'm gonna make little toppers that kind of go on the top of them and I've seen people make those as well and they are super cute so there's the first one there's the second one and I think this one might be my favorite I love the pink color on her little cheeks and her little eyelashes I just think she is so cute there's a look at the bottom where it says 180 degrees so those are the ones I got they're really super nice quality you hear me tapping on that there these are not plastic here's this little one and it has the chocolate melting on it and I will tell you that these do say they are microwave and dishwasher safe which is great and there's the last one in the set wouldn't these be so adorable for some little ones around the holiday time drinking all those a tiny little hot chocolate or a little marshmallows I'd be so cute the next thing that I'm going to share with you is something we got for KC and it is a new pair of tennis shoes and many of you asked what shoes we wear in the parks and we have come to really love the Disney parks and we have really come to love Asics brand KC the pair that he has on now or he has been wearing that he loves we actually got at Disney Springs when we were down in Disney and so he really needed a new pair and what I did was I just got him the newer model of the shoes that he had already been wearing and loving and then I got them in this red white grey and black because these are Elijah's school colors and we live in Ohio so you know don't Buckeyes so he wanted some shoes and so I got these for him and I'll show you kind of up close they are the Asics g2 mm flight foam if you are interested like I said we really love wearing these in the Disney parks and just out and about as well so if Casey's not at work he's either wearing some dress boots or tennis shoes and we really love these I actually have the women's version as well so there's an up-close look and then that's how they look from the side and then the back and I think this side has yeah that G 2 mm right there so he really likes these I know he's anxious to wear them and I think they'll be perfect for sure super comfortable one other big surprise that we have for Casey it has not arrived yet I think he kind of thinks that he's getting it but he's not for sure is a little storage shed for our back porch to something nice there to put by our back door we got a little craftsman building to put there I think it's like 5 foot by 2 foot and so once that comes obviously we don't have it for this video and we wanted to get it filmed but when it comes I will share a picture of it with you on Twitter and Instagram so definitely make sure you're following us there miss you a tech so if you aren't and we'll be sharing pictures of that there once we get it continuing on with the last two things that I got for my birthday I am in love with this bag that Casey got for me and he ordered this from Vera Bradley and I have to say I didn't even realize now that you can get the Disney designs from Vera Bradley I just I haven't been on there forever so he got me this I saw this on shop Disney and I just I fell in love with it because I just think it hits all of my boxes it's comfortable you can clean it I think that the Aqua turquoisey color definitely lends itself to summer and the beach which we love it's got Disney on it which we love and it's a nice large size so when I'm able to get back out right on hunting and shopping it will be a perfect one for me to take and so I'm just gonna take you on a little tour quickly here of everything about this bag what it looks like and the pockets in case it's something that you might be interested in picking up so real quickly here on the tag it is the iconic Vera tote and it has secured zip closed top multiple pockets inside and out for organization and I top in slip pocket and I have to say that top hidden slip pocket is genius I love it but here is an up-close look at the pattern and I always worry when you do order bags like this and the dunya mercs online because it's hanging around here you never really know where your pattern placement is going to be and I just think that I got an excellent one I'm super happy with it I've got Mickey right there on the front and then a nice mini and then down here I've got Pluto and the bird right there in the front and then around on the back flip that over there it's got super great placement too so I don't know if it's just the way they have this pattern set up if you're you know if you're gonna get those but I'm really happy with where mine are I've got a nice mini right there a little cute linking Mickey so adorable okay so it's got two straps and these straps are very padded and squishy and you can see I've got plenty of arm room right there so really nice and then it does have the pocket there on the front nice size look at that I've got my whole hand down in there basically let me grab my phone and that's the larger iPhone and definitely fits right down in there with plenty of room and I have the pop socket on the back up MARY POPPINS and I'm sorry theory it's got a zippered pocket also really nice size and then that slip that hidden slip pocket I'll show you because so I'm zipped on the top great so nothing falls out and then here's your hidden slip pocket right down in there and I'll throw my phone in there again whoop maybe up see and it fits right down in there like I said that's the larger iPhone eight the red one so okay and now let's go ahead here's your zippered top open that slides across there real easy and then here's a look inside at the lining how pretty that is now my cat's trying to get in I'm so sorry about that he's pawing at the door and it has six slip pockets on the inside so there's three on one side and then flip it around and then it has three more additional slip pockets so plenty plenty of storage inside this bag you can fit a lot in there I bet you you can fit a water bottle right in those for sure because it doesn't have an outside pocket for water bottle but I'd say there's plenty of room in there for a water bottle give you another look here you can see kind of how it looks on my body and I am just short of 5/3 I'm like 5 2 and 3/4 so that's about how it looks on me all right I am as excited as I am about all of these things and I love them all I am so excited to show the last if that I got with all of you I previously recorded this and then I also took some pictures of some updates because things have already changed and so I'm going to go ahead and stop here for the minute for the moment and throw in that footage and pictures everybody say hello to me Auggie the mini Rex bunny I named him Miyagi off of Karate Kid I love the 80s and loved that movie and it just seemed to fit this little guy we just got him and so we temporarily have him in this little cage here well I guess it's not little for him it's pretty good-sized for him and what we are trying to do is to kind of get him accustomed to trying to use a litter pan so if anybody has any tips on litter trading a bunny oh he's super happy now I gave him his little carrot he loves these baby carrots and I think Elijah did some looking up on him I think he's only going to get baby up to four and a half pounds and we are assuming at this point in time that he is a male that's what the lady said that she thought he was a meal but he's so so young it's really hard to tell is that Miyake  yeah I know you're not used to this camera being on the ARIA that's new he is just so super sweet do you like your new additions Miyagi yeah I think you liked this house not I certainly didn't want to start wrapping up this video without sharing with you what is most most important to me and what means more to me than any of the presents in the world and that is definitely my family and you guys know who have followed us for years the boys always go out of their way to be so thoughtful and make things so special for me and they definitely did that I had a birthday in quarantine but it was so memorable I'll never forget it and they did everything they could to make that day as special as they could for me Elijah made me cupcakes from start to finish on his own he made the batter he put them in the cups he baked them he iced them he put the sprinkles on top and then when Casey finally got home from work he took me us up to Olive Garden for to go dinner and we had Olive Garden dinner in the car and so I will definitely always remember it I've got a couple of pictures from that and I wanted to share this with all of you thank you everyone for watching this video today we really appreciate it
