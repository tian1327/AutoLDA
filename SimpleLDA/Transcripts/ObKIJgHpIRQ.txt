her so it's all like french fry crystals and say that and then we're watching the fireplace while we're working well he's working outside cleaning super-fun Sunday afternoon I'm sweating a dress so we decided to work out and we got like half way through our workout when we realize that we should be recording this for you guys so chris is just gonna quickly show you what we were doing we're doing a shoulder workout we're using five pound weights because we're both super out of shape and I don't even know what these are called but we did each of these exercises we did 15 reps and we did three sets of each rep so they're like shoulder raises with our palms facing out and then we did straight up making sure to keep our cores tight and a little bend in the knee and then straight across so that was our first circuit and like I said we did 15 reps of each exercise and we did three sets of it oh no sorry four sets of it and then this is I don't know what you call this better bent over pull up and then bend over pull backs and then every other so this is the same thing four sets of 15 reps each for that circuit and then here's a little tricep dip you really want to concentrate he set on keeping your elbows close to your head so it'll really work your triceps and then after he does 15 reps he's gonna go straight into the second movement or exercise or whatever in this circuit and it's just kind of a push up it's like a straight bar pushup kind of but with dumbbells you can see how knowledgeable I am in my exercises and then the next movement in this circuit is an Arnold so it's just gonna go around the front and then I press up and like I said he's gonna do 15 reps of each for this circuit and then we're moving on to the next circuit so this is gonna be some arm ups I like a 45 degree angle so not straight it side not straight forward kind of in the middle 15 reps of that and then after that he's gonna go straight into I think this is like a chest press it kind of reminded me of like doing a push-up and he's doing 15 of these he said the key with this is just to make sure that you're keeping your hands close without touching these were a killer these AB things oMG I couldn't do it with the ten pounds I had to put one of the five-pound weights down oh but you want to like twist with your core this really got my heart rate up so like I said 15 reps of each four sets in this part of the circuit and then this was the last one so this is just a kick I did I think I did 20 kicks this was pretty cool I liked this movement and then I have no idea what this is called but this is what we did we did 15 reps on each on each arm he said the higher up you have your arm the more it'll work like your upper back and then the lower you move your arm back when you pull it back the more it'll get your lower part of your back so it's either a little leader to your lats or your lower back and I'm trying to strengthen up my lower back so I was pulling it back farther down than he was but that's really vain and then the last part of this little circuit was squats now I couldn't use the weights with the squats with my back I just did bodyweight squats but he used the weights for it and we just did 20 squats to to round it off to even it off so that was our back workout that we did pretty intense I was sweating it's pretty crazy behind ya have a good PA so we're watching Sonic the Hedgehog and my face looks dirty but I have it's like they still hurt but that's okay it look real good I have so I had to put down that shitty comforter on top of the nice comforter I don't want anything to be messing up you feel me so yeah we're watching Sonic the Hedgehog it's pretty funny it's pretty cute it's like a kids movie we're just hanging out we had some
