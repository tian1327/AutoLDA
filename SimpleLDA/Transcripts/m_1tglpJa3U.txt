   so I made this not really healthy salad out of chicken spinach I love Tomatoes we put some nut to nib and then just a bunch of random stuff to be honest  hey what's up everyone welcome back to another vlog for those of you don't know me my name is Jasmine I'm gonna link my social media down here I am an emergency department nurse I just started few months ago I don't talk a lot about nursing lifestyle fitness and that's my watch I just got my Apple watch and I don't know how if anybody knows how they turn off the sound on this please let me know because I literally don't know how and it keeps ringing so I want to do this video kind of a while back and talk about how to enjoy being alone but I guess in today's world it's a little bit hard with all the media and everything but since a lot of us are in self-isolation mode I wanted to talk about ways to feel less alone and what we can do to feel more connected during this time there was actually a post that inspired it made me really sad to read this post I'm gonna throw it up on here but I'm gonna write it to you so this is from a post from nurse life RN someone messaged him saying please help i'm hysteric i'm having a full-on mental breakdown right now i'm a i'm a nurse in california and my entire family and lots of friends live on the east coast so many people I know have left LA and I'm here by myself currently with no one in sight well when I see my loved ones again I don't why I'm sobbing because I go to work and it's hard and I have no one to talk to I can call people but it's not the same the thought of being alone until August potentially makes me sick I want to put my job but I don't know how I can emotionally handle all this I feel trapped because there seems like there's nothing else I can do I need to pay bills I have a lease I don't want to fly and infect people I just need ways to cope I don't know how long this a lot of people it's hard to deal with the fact that we don't necessarily have an end date to this whole quarantine so I just want to talk about ways to feel a little bit more connected I know this these tips aren't necessarily going to solve a problem but they can make you feel a little bit better during these trying times so let's just get into it so the first so I just wanted to give a little background first of all this person more than ever I don't know the exact statistics on it maybe I should look it up right now 6 more than ever the statistic is according to Wall Street Journal today thirty five point seven million Americans live alone so that's insane because twenty eight percent of households that is up from thirteen percent of households in nineteen sixty so more than ever more people are living alone and that's like the common trend I think especially in LA and just in California in general a lot of people are living by themselves which is a little bit hard especially during these times where were called the socially distance ourselves from people so I can't even begin to imagine going months and months without any type of social interaction as humans were called to be in a part of the community we gravitate towards being part of like a pack I think we are considered like pack animals because it's an and we are technically animals it's a little bit hard for a lot of people to socially isolate for months and months we don't know if this is gonna go till August we don't know if this is going to go for the next two weeks we have no idea so here without further ado here are a few tips that may not necessarily solve the problems in lowliness here are a few tips that may help with the feeling of being lonely so number one I don't technically live alone I actually live with a lot of people which is a little bit scary because of the fact that I am on the frontline I'm in the emergency department and I see patient for patient all the time it's a blessing and curse it helps in terms of loneliness but I do try to self isolate myself as much as possible because the fact that I could potentially be a carrier and not know it so that's why as much as possible I don't really try to kind of Iran my family as much there's like two elderly people in this house two middle-aged people then two I have two younger siblings living in this house so there's a lot of people and if I get one person sick we're all bound to get sick so that's my thing so these are the things that I've been doing eat so without further ado I'm gonna go ahead and get into it because I keep talking and talking about all these random things so the first thing that I've been doing is doing live Corp our so number one the first thing I've been doing is alive workout classes so there are a lot of like recorded once online but I do like you into live ones because I feel like it's more interactive and for one you can't go back or pause so it makes you go through the whole workout and that gives you like a sense of community so for example I'm gonna give the example of core power because it's the one that I've been doing most consistently core power has these live classes that they're doing on YouTube you should definitely go check them out they're run really good find the instructors that you like so there's bodyweight sculpt which is without any weights sculpt if you do have whites or you can use like water bottles and then there's also c2 which is more like stretching and like traditional yoga and then there's meditation at the end of it I do really have a hard time with meditation I think it's because I'm like the type of person who always like to be moving really fast power there's also a lot of people like for example let me look up her username Laurie cereal yoga she also does a variety of different yoga they do like yogalates from raw yoga and I really like doing those ones it's really fun and I don't know their instructors are really good they're really uplifting and a lot of the yoga instructors who really help ground you especially at the time like this so I've been really enjoying that so I definitely recommend doing the live classes they do also have group chats so I think it's more so that you can tell them that you can't hear them or the music is too loud but a lot of people like to comments on there and I feel like it really helps you feel like you're in a real class so that's really nice and I like really doing those because they have them like three times a day four times a day like Oh time okay no but it's a really obvious one and that's zoom calling or facetiming obviously everyone's been chains lately what me and my friends have been doing what we do is well like zoom call while there's like a virtual rave going on and that's really fun and just scheduling zoom calls as if you're having like a hangout so let's take for example like you and a friend scheduled coffee for like 9:00 a.m. on Monday morning you guys can do the same thing but virtually I know it's not nearly the same but it still gives you that interaction that kind of um simulates that kind of effect where at least you have something to look forward to and you're able to have that social interaction so that you are necessarily alone and I think one of the harder things is like reaching out to friends and I've had up like a couple people who haven't talked to in a long time reach out to me and at first it was like kind of like taken aback by it I was a little bit confused why they were contacting me but I think at the end of that everyone's just trying to check in on each other and make sure that everyone's okay so don't be afraid to like reach out to a friend and ask to schedule like a zoom call or something like that just to like catch up number three is webinars so I have recently found let me find the email it's it's like the best you I think that's what it's called and they have these webinars that are essentially like virtual talks I haven't actually attended one cuz the one I was supposed to go to today actually got rescheduled but oh my god I'm watching so much I didn't even notice but let's see okay I don't want to show my information but okay what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna throw it up there after I'm done editing it in but basically what it is I'm gonna cover my last name so nobody I'm sure people have figured it out but I also don't want so I'm gonna blurt it out but let me see I'll kind of pop it up on here anyway so I don't pop it up I'm just gonna show it here anyway it's called webinar and it was with David Meltzer not really sure who it is but they do have other webinars with people who have written books or co-written books let me bring out the one thing so this book is the one that Alex recently gave me it's by Robert T Kiyosaki and then there's some lady who co-authored it but she's not really credited in here I think that's called Rich Dad Poor Dad and trying to see if she's credited her name is Cher and I don't know her last name but she is going to have a webinar pretty soon I think it's supposed to be in like two days but I have work so I can't really go to it but they do have webinars and it's just a good way to be able to like stay motivated and - I think you're able to like ask questions and stuff it's like kind of an educational little self-help kind of thing and I think it'd be really cool especially if you're bored and you have nothing else to do it's by this company the best UX boat they were supposed to have won in March oh my gosh why is it like not showing I don't understand they're the best you Expo they were supposed to have it in March the same weekend as beyond like March 21st or something like that but they weren't able to have it obviously because of what's going on so they're having like these webinars which is really cool it's really educational and if you actually know some of the people it would be a really cool experience because you're able to kind of like interact with them let me see who else there is because there was like quite a few people but I personally didn't know so like this guy Bernardo Moya is the founder of the messiyah promoter for some of the biggest names in personal development interviews of David Meltzer CEO of Sports one marketing and then he was also CEO of Ally Steinberg sport-tuned entertainment and yeah there's just like a lot of good like inspirational people on there and I think it'd be really cool if you to attend one of the webinars because you're educating yourself well interacting with other people so and it's free also like everything that I'm about to say it's like free another thing that might be kind of obvious is to just like keep busy during these times one thing I've been doing is reading like a lot of books it's like for example this book Alex and I like switch book a little while ago and I am NOT a big reader but I need to get off my phone a lot more so because my screen time is like increased by 20% I am trying to get more into books now I also have this book that I like the cover of but never actually read yes I think I'm gonna read this on today because it should be pretty sure like literally it's like a picture but so reading another thing I've been doing is obviously making videos that's like really what my big thing is you're in house quarantine if you haven't noticed and I literally just felt anything I no way video quality isn't like amazing or anything nothing like super creative but I feel like more connected through everyone just by making videos because people are watching them commenting and messaging me on Instagram which i think is really cool another thing I wanted to mention I don't know if anyone's like religious or anything but something that's a little bit comforting me is like praying because praying to God or whoever you associate with as your higher being it's comforting to me in the sense that I feel like someone's listening so whoever you necessarily talk to or said prayers to I guess and then the last thing I wanted to mention is that this isn't necessarily for forever we're not gonna be alone forever and hopefully we don't know what I say when this ends but when it does and if we are able to stay a part now will eventually be check out that her again when this is all over so yeah so yeah that's pretty much my tips for ways to stay less lonely or dealing with bullying that's during these trying times if you guys have any other suggestions leave them down below I know this lighting has been changing like crazy but yeah I hope this helps if not hopefully this is kind of an informative for people who are living alone or our board or are struggling with the idea of feeling lonely right now so that's pretty much it for this video don't forget to comment down below if you guys have any other tips because these are just my own tips that I kind of like come up with don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already and I'm gonna leave my social media right here my Instagram I think that's where most people connect with me is at jazz iners and yeah I guess I'll see you guys in the next video
