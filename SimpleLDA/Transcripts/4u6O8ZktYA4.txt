 I also have a playlist now this is a dumb to be filming literally 35 minutes after waking up maybe everybody would open to my channel my name is Chris Cummins or if you don't mind commenting to welcome back to the dysfunction that is my channel guys we are moving the moving vlogs have begun how do i flow into this vlog we're moving may be filming right as i woke up was not a good idea we've been in this house for a year and a half a lot of people might be wondering why we're moving out y'all came into this house really wanting a dedicated room to work in honestly over the last year and a half we've grown and expanded to the point where we just need more space because i work where i live i really wanted to have better boundaries between the two and i feel really good about this in the new house the house we're moving to guys it's like literally the nicest lesson I've ever looked I've never lived in so because we get the keys today and we strike the moving process I wanted to just document it all I've gotten a lot of requests to do a house tour in this house but I don't really love the ideas of house tours because this is like where I live and I don't want people knowing the ins and outs of my house so I figured I'd do a little house tour of this place before we leave one to remember the house that we lived in for a year and a half and then to to show you guys finally of where we've been living for the last year but before we get into this video as a lot of you guys know I dedicate each of my videos during this time to different small businesses organizations or causes and today is no different a few weeks ago actually one of my good friends Phineas his mom created an organization called support and feed I actually got to spend an afternoon with Phineas mom and she kind of took me along and told me everything that goes on with support and feed and I got to see what an afternoon looks like for people picking up and delivering the food the way it works is that support and feed basically partners with different local plant based restaurants in a few cities at this plan people can basically buy meals that then get made by the plant-based restaurants and those are getting picked up by support and feet volunteers and taken to hotels that are housing a homeless they're being taken to hospitals and frontline workers and again it's all plant-based food so it's helping these small businesses that don't have the name recognition of Domino's and it's also helping the planet because it's a plan face it's also helping the homeless and the frontline workers who really are just sacrificing and in the even bigger way than they already were I value the afternoon I spent with Maggie and the support and feed team and it was just really rewarding an eye-opening day honestly I'm gonna leave a link in the second line of the description of the support and feed website where you can go donate money different plant-based restaurants that provided meals to people who need them right now Oh guys I just can't say enough good things about support and feed Thank You supporting feed for letting me come along with you as I always say if you have the ability to help someone right now you should let's go show support and feed how the clementines show up okay this is our garage which that literally looks like a scene out of s-video oh come into the kitchen in the morning it gets so much light and it is the best excuse my bong oopsies I always said that this kitchen reminded me of a hot dog like is this counter color not the color of a  hot dog and they're these not bun like is that not bun hot dog bun that thought process should definitely explain a lot of the videos I've come up well  yeah this is the kitchen that you guys always see in video this island that a lot of people see I have only just realised and learned that it's actually on wheels a lot of people ask what this is it's an indoor grill but it doesn't work so we use it for a produce tray moving right along we have like the espresso and bar area we don't have a lot on it because we have been drinking heavily next we have the dining area this is obviously where we eat as you can see it comes over into the living room or this big couch and TV it's pretty simple and then over here we obviously have a bunch of stuff for moving that we'll get into later and there was just kind of a bookshelf there a little painting desks that used to be my old dog a mirror and then when you go this way that's the kitchen again there's Andrews room the front door so there's the living room and then through this doorway is where we get to the office so this is the office and you probably have seen this room a lot whether it's like instagrams and chefs my new desk here's my little corner you guys might remember obviously that good pal got some of my rolling papers that I framed and I love this they're like kind of 3d and this mirror is where we store all of our filming stuff so yeah it's kind of boring we have a bathroom we have another bedroom right there with built-in storage and then we have my room I've never really showed my room - yeah you walk in the door and then right on your left is a TV that comes out and swivels and angles so I can watch from bed they have this little cabinet that I don't really care about but I just needed something thin to go under a TV then I have some other  in here honestly this is like I don't even want to know I do have enough remember I've had room for a couch and about here's my coffee table there's the captain's guys look at all of the new little growth so the coffee table we have the couch which has a ton of  on it and then we have my bed and I'm getting a new bed in the new place I'm getting a king-size and it's gonna be a whole different frame and yeah this is my bedroom these are other mirrors which are closet then you come into my bathroom there's a toilet I'm gonna poop in there yeah okay the cosmetics oh this is the backyard and I really love that like nobody can see into our backyard into our house and it's just been a really nice backyard to have to feel like it's its own little world finally this is the backyard these rose bushes are usually just always in full bloom it's nice to have just like a little base for outside nuts then we have the pool which is always  freezing then we have this nice little hangout area that I've never sought out because there's always plate or web guys follow me on Instagram this is the grass I grow which is all dead now there's some fruit trees back there and then we just have this little back part oh my god and that's the side Jesus God so that's the house we've been living in for the last year and a half I just realized that people also wanted plant updates so yeah this is the cactus it's growing beautifully lots of new growth so by Marty regretting giving a plant up to the venus flytraps are thriving who have never been going so strong I do need to get a bigger terrarium for them because this one they have outgrown people said that these wouldn't last 20 seconds with me  you I did of this plant which was on my desk into my bathroom because I think it needed more late I really don't know what this plant has a lot of leaves have fallen off I don't know guys doing my best the other two plants here is one of them and this one has been popping out flowers it grows flowers very quickly so that one's pretty fun and then lastly guys oh my god my ficus lerato my betel-leaf big these two leaves just popped out the topic it is really thriving and dad is not plan update now in a few hours we are gonna go get the keys to the new place and therefore our moving process begins it is May 28th today and in a few hours we're gonna go get the keys so that we can begin to move any my art movers for Monday June 1st that um we're gonna be doing some small loads back and forth before that let's go get the keys to the new place so we are on our way to our new house Oh what is fun sentence I don't know how much of the new house I'm gonna show in this vlog necessarily I might show a few little bits I'm gonna show it more so like once we have furniture and all of our stuff in there anyway see you at the new house oh my god this is my bedroom there's a gas fireplace I have a cave bed going over your Isaac the bathroom this is my bathroom there's a buttload of mirrors so then this bathroom leads into my closet just come back into the main room if you approach from this side this is the closet there is a sink area right here and I'm gonna try and put a little mini fridge right there I'm thinking out is leaving this door to the bathroom closed and getting some shelving here for shoes and that I have all of this storage in here which are like shelves and stuff it really cannot wait they're just like this next like era like all jokes aside I'm just like wow this just really be my new bedroom do the fire I just said with Skyy you got a lighter are you kidding that is my straining room for twitch and then lastly is my office you're doing a walkthrough today while getting the keys we found that there is a literal walk-in pantry but we're gonna do an open shelving pantry right here but we'll walk in here have some pantry shelving and then we'll have Harry Potter it's just like literally the craziest thing I feel I just I'm like how did this how did we got here so a lot of people might be wondering about finding a house in the middle of a pandemic this honestly was the first house we looked at looking for leases is always tough for me because it always makes me feel really shitty because you're like being put on display to be judged by these people and being young it's never easy and so this we literally heard back that we got this the day after less than 24 hours we really got so lucky the people just we fell in love with each other a modern-day love affair call me buyers a little estate now it's ours for a year leaves and then we have to give it back or renew it oh also I have fully gotten back into Romans revenge 2.0 with Lil Wayne what the  guys that song alright guys it didn't do anything didn't do a  thing to I'll just see you tomorrow actually know before they go to bed we're having a conversation if at this point you're not aware of what's going on with George Floyd and everything in Minneapolis I'm just so honestly disappointed and you know I tweeted this out and I've instagrammed this but I want to say it on my youtube channel as my biggest audience if you are experiencing racism especially as a white person who has the ultimate privilege and you do not say anything shame on you I don't care how uncomfortable it has to be I don't care and as white people especially in this situation we are the ones that need to have the conversation I'm just so done with this I'm just so  tired of living in the  60s if you witness racism with your family or your friends if you don't know what to say your friends or family are saying it if they're your friends and your family they should care about you say that that makes me uncomfortable this is why these are the factual historical references as to why this is offensive and it hurts me as an ally make them uncomfortable that you're uncomfortable it's like all I can think about I just feel so bad for  minorities in this country I just feel bad and I know I'm not making I don't want to make this about me because it's not about me if you need to learn how to be better allies  Google it please do not ask a black person or a person of color good god they are so tired of telling us what to do follow why people watching pay attention to who the  is not posting about this or is not talking about this or - does not seem to be fazed by this hate notes shit's  off the next morning I have taken over a few loads of coats the other thing I did was buy and pick up the bookshelf from Target that I'm using but the thing is yeah I gotta build it guys I  did it  did it oh  indeed he broke I don't know part of that level of screaming but I'm gonna go put it into the closet now and then we'll see the fit on me and over the shoe shelf is done looks a little janky but I'm thinking I'll put a bag on top of there I don't know I need to take a shower this is bad I look back it is Saturday now and I have cleaned out the entirety of under my TV I'm gonna try and put this in my car and bring it to the new place and kind of put all of this  that I pulled out of it I remember what the last thing I've logged was but we have pretty much a ton of my clothes back here we've got some in the trunk got a bunch of shoes and that's what's going on I don't know what it is but I've walked into about a hundred spiderwebs today and I again don't know what it is I really had nothing to do with anything I just wanted to get it off my chest I'm at the new house as you can fully tell by the echo this is the thing for my room that I brought that I was talking about because my closet has like a weird bar area I got a little mini fridge that I could put my hustle matcha drinks and I have to figure out the electrical because there's no outlet and then I've been moving in my shoes and my bags and my clothes as much as I can just trying to have as much my  here as possible so that when Monday rolls around it doesn't feel too often it's kind of a seamless transition moving  is so exhausting and yet not as exhausting as just the blatant racism in America so summer in the next video all of the furniture is getting moved and we will be like pretty much fully moved in I would say I will say it's very weird moving right now and being excited over a new house which is like the craziest house I've ever dreamed of living in and having the world just be the way it is right now especially in the United States you don't know what's going on  educate yourself there's a ton of resources online please go donate and sign petition and being very vocal on my Instagram tour about this so if you're looking for resources I'm always kind of updating their lastly if you're white and/or privileged just for the record those usually go hand in hand but is your job to stand up against even tiny ass racial events it is your job to speak up and do the right thing it doesn't matter how uncomfortable the conversations are it's just if there's enough is enough
