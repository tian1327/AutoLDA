  hi guys welcome back this is such an exciting start to a vlog because this is the very last video of every day May 20 2013 video 31 I'm about to put on some makeup so I can film day 30 and then this is day 31 I also have the scarf on my head because my hair was being a little poofy earlier and I'm trying to like flatten it a little i'm currently listening to a bunch of new songs to kind of curate my June playlist I say curate as if I like work at Spotify or something which would actually be a dream to create playlists for Spotify Spotify if you're listening if you guys have been watching any of my videos this month then you'd know there are two things that I take very very seriously television and music I take my playlists incredibly seriously I really take a long time to curate them to make them perfect and really representative of how I'm feeling that month or that season if you can pick one favorite video from this entire everyday May series I'd love to know which one it was I've also been getting a ton of questions about what my plans are for June and if I'm gonna be doing more videos I've been getting a ton of requests for vlogs so yes I will continue to be vlogging throughout June I feel like every day May has just it's made me fall in love with YouTube again it's made me enjoy creating so much and like I really just wanted to challenge myself because I've tried doing everyday May this is probably I think my third attempt at doing everyday May and I've also tried doing vlog Tober in the past I've tried doing vlogmas in the past this year I told myself like in the start of the year I was like this year I'm going to do everyday May and I'm going to complete it and I because I want to enter June which is my birthday month by the way my birthday's do 15th knowing that I accomplished this thing that I've been trying to do for a few years now so yeah so I'm just going to finish getting ready and then I'm gonna fill my day 30 video ok makeup is done I hopefully my hair looks ok I think what happened is that my hair successfully de-puffed over here but the back is little puffy so it looks kind of crazy so its fact young because I spent this morning filming editing and uploading another video so now I need to find a good place to film this video where that has a good lighting okay so it's a little bit later I finished filming and I've been watching Grey's Anatomy with Rebecca do I have something else while we eat food yeah we should watch something else we've been watching Grey's Anatomy all day can we just take a moment to look at who's on the screen McSteamy and McDreamy what's on our watch list white lines white lines is created by the person who made funny heist why not tomorrow morning we're gonna be working is their economy we can watch watch avatar let's watch avatar yes we're gonna watch avatar so it's a beautiful day today so Rebecca and I are gonna go to just we're just gonna go out and get some fresh air and walk we are going to avoid any big crowds any protesting or anything and but if we see something interesting we will still take a look I don't know if you look ready I am ready it's gorgeous outside  we just walked by Union Square and almost have a little bit of a panic attack though because it was the tension oh my god the tensions were high there's so much police there I was like I think we need to go you know yeah they were ready this is our lunch right now I don't know what happened to the bottom of this yep some grilled cheese going and some tomato soup it looks amazing okay so I feel like this vlog is very scattered this weekend is just like super crazy and we've kind of just been glued to the TV to the news so I kind of don't even remember what I vlog today so the Sun is setting and every day May is almost over so I thought I'd celebrate with a drink my dad got us some tequila a little while ago and I'm finally gonna break it open and I break it open is that is that a phrase break it open crack it open anyway I really want to make myself and Rebecca I guess a margarita I've never made a margarita before but it seems pretty simple since we live pretty close to Union Square it's a very it's a really quick one great if you're walking slow it'll take ten minutes you know if you guys have been keeping up with you know what's going on that's where a lot of the protests and riots were don't worry we were walking at like 1:00 p.m. or something like it was the middle of the day we kinda just wanted to check it out I was getting really anxious while we were walking towards there cuz obviously anything could happen I 100% support the protests it's just my anxious ass probably shouldn't be there even though everything was calm and everything was very peaceful it's just you never know what can happen at any moment so we kind of just walked and checked it out very briefly I think I took a very quick clip of everything like there were a lot of people in Union Square there were also like so many cops like so many but yeah again everything was very peaceful when we were there um I just hope that everyone stays safe tonight but we also did just walk around the area we of course went to Gramercy Park which is just such a nice peaceful little area and honey got some fresh air and I also made some simple syrup earlier which is just one part water one part sugar you just heat up the water and then dissolve the sugar in it and then put it in fridge to let it cool and then we just have some limes and sparkling water and that's gonna make our margarita wait these are martini glasses what our margarita glasses I don't know why I took these out I know this is how you know I haven't been out in a long time people are gonna be like is this girl 19 years old does she not know how to do alcohol I promise guys well I mean I don't make my own drinks I literally never made myself an actual mixed drinks it's usually other people who do it so yeah we're just gonna use our Moscow Mule cups because why not or Rebecca's market moscow let me not say your name because Becca's I'd rather die everyone calls her Becca but I don't and she gets she's been pointing out that I say her name weird which is offensive because you're my sister do you not want a margarita okay this is going to be a very we don't have ice because our ice machine is kind of wonky right now and we don't have a shaker so we're gonna do a very makeshift margarita it's gonna taste delicious its alcohol and sugar right so we're gonna do two shots of tequila so it's gonna end up being one shot per person I am NOT a bartender  it's Caitlyn oh my god smelly college recorder shot lime juice 3/4 suit okay so I wanted to end every day May by just hanging out and sipping on some alcohol cuz your girl needs it after this month this month has truly been a wild ride like I'm really proud of myself you know I learned how to make more drinks my mom makes this incredible ginger pear martini it's she makes it during the holidays maybe that'll be like my next endeavor is to learn how to be a bartender or a mixologist or whatever they're called so yeah I wanted to say thank you guys a lot for you know hanging out with me every day this month I'm absolutely gonna be doing more vlogs in movie even here helicopters but yeah we're about to order some Shake Shack for dinner because you know I wanted to celebrate by having some alcohol and some Shake Shack I'm gonna quickly finish editing this video upload this video head on a zoom call with my family watch some television and just enjoy the rest of the night so anyway I hope you guys have enjoyed everyday May and I hope it's been fun for you guys cuz it's been very fun for me so thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you very soon with another video
