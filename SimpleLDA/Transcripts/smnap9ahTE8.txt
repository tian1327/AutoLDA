 hey don't tell anybody that I'm pulling my math down but I can't breathe I wish I had the gimbal right about now so so gorgeous today so today Friday and I'm getting tested for Kovach 19 and I thought I would just take you through the process in the hopes that I can a inspire somebody to go get tested and be you know be brave for the camera so I'm just walking right now to the nearest City MD from me City MD is a private walk-in clinic that they have all over the city and they're doing private testing and antibody testing I'm not gonna lie I'm absolutely terrified but at the end of the day I feel like it's probably been through worse being a woman from the age you know 18 and up you pretty much have to deal with unpleasant  like this every year so I don't know how to sound is so why am I getting tested I'm obviously a healthy young person I'm 24 and I haven't had any symptoms but I'm hoping to go visit my parents and my grandparents so I think it's important that I do this for them okay I made it out of the line I made it I think I'm gonna reward myself and start by gesture I think I should be able to find one around here there's one but it doesn't have opened there's a little bit of a nine yeah see what they say I gotta get some air we did it I feel the need to be completely honest because I I think that everyone is kind of tiptoeing around it it hurts but it's not a big deal the doctors med to me this is not going to be painful but it might be a bit uncomfortable but I don't know if it's my sinuses being a bit inflamed because it's allergy season and I do always have allergies this time of year I don't know if it was that or what but it definitely hurt but only for like three seconds and it really wasn't a big deal I would do it again if I had to like no question a blood test obviously is once you've had one you you know you know how it's gonna go down and I absolutely encourage you to go get tested the doctor did say I can't remember if I said this before but the doctor did say that I'm the perfect candidate for getting tested for the antibodies and kovat because I'm a healthy young person and they really want to know how much of the population has resolved the virus already without even realizing it so that information will really help them to get the numbers more accurate I don't know I don't think the swab was as long as it looked on TV or anywhere in social media like they keep showing those memes but it didn't look that long it was tiny and it didn't last long it couldn't feel how far up it was going and it didn't feel like it was going any farther up than like you know I don't know I don't know it wasn't a big deal it really wasn't but it did hurt for three seconds and then it was over so I feel like they're lying about that a little bit cuz I would not describe that as uncomfortable and I think I have a pretty high pain tolerance so anyway thanks for tuning in good luck go get tested
