 yo I have been praying low likely been feeling low things in New York are sound scary sad trying to stay positive but yeah I don't know just the usual is going on I've been doing a bit of gardening indoor gardening doing a bit more exercise walking a lot I've been you're playing cooking and cleaning as usual all the whole things but today today I created kind of a meal plan to try and use up the rest of the food that I have so that I don't have to go back to the grocery store for at least another week and a half that's the hope I'm gonna try and use them everything that I have even in the freezer and then make a list and do another shop so it's two people breakfast lunch and dinner I decided to not pre cook breakfasts they usually feel like having eggs so I'm just going to do that in the morning time like up you like I've been doing um I'll just prepare dinners and have I did the leftovers from dinner for lunch or sandwiches for lunch and I'm going to start cooking my spaghetti squash in the instant pot I've never tried this bighetti squash in the instant pot so this should be fun  thank spaghetti swashes in the instant pot and now I'm going to attempt to make sweet potato gnocchi I've made this before but I haven't made it in a long time and I want to have it for dinner tonight because we have a code three potato but I don't want to run away   and then basically I we ate those meals and I eventually had to go to the grocery store again about a week later I froze some of that chili that you saw and we ate that meatloaf within like I think two days not even just between the two of us and I saved the spaghetti squash to use as a side dish for the meatloaf to have with some of the chili and then a week later we went to Trader Joe's and the line was outrageous we waited online for about an hour and a half and we stopped up and that was about two weeks ago and we still have food from that shop because once you wait that long in line to get into the grocery store once you get in there you're like okay I have to grab everything that I need and that just creates kind of our cart was completely full so I had to freeze a lot of the stuff but they luckily still have food from Bend we haven't had to go to the to a big grocery shop since then just been trying just basically been trying to eat meals that I enjoy but also that provide nourishment as much as possible with what we have and what we got from our Trader Joe's shop our seedlings have popped up from the indoor gardening and we've transferred a lot of them to bigger pots now which is exciting my birthday came and went I turned 32 I have two birthday cakes that my husband made that we have in our fridge that he doesn't even like cake so I have to eat them all by myself so that's fun had some zoom parties    my family and facetimed with my friends   these are my blue light glasses that I've gotten since then because I've been looking at a lot of screens and I figured I wanted to protect my eyes yeah things have just throughout this month been a lot harder than I thought it would be I thought I would just be able to hunker down and being my productive self and get as much done as possible and clean and declutter and make a million videos and vlog and I don't even know I had like a list as long as my arm how many things that I wanted to do and I couldn't do any of them the only thing that I literally could do was the bare minimum for the yoga videos which you've seen on the yoga channel trying to prepare food and feel like I have some sense of control in that way I'm trying to clean the house and feel like I have set some sense of control in that way because trying to ignore what's going on out there is kind of impossible one of those people that thought they were going to be super productive and ended up just having to cope with all this and trying to cope with it in my own way I would I don't even know how much longer of this we have here in New York things are improving but they're not better a lot of people are still dying from the virus still not a good situation having to I guess increased our regulations where we have to now we have to wear masks in the grocery stores or in any situation even outside where we can't social distance I mean it's just saying nothing is open still grocery shopping is the only thing that we really go out for and ran a few errands for my elderly relatives and my parents and things of it but that's pretty much it so yeah my next project that I'm hoping to tackle is I want to vlog more but I also have things that I want to do like I need to clear out that wall that I used to film my yoga videos in if you're familiar with my yoga channel you may remember I was filming in my home for quite some time and I was filming against this one wall by the window but I had to stop that because there's a stuff there now so I need to try and figure out how to clear that so that might be an upcoming video me trying to clear that space and create a space for filming yoga videos in my home again because yeah the videos that you've been seeing on the yoga channel have been previously filmed at YouTube when your tube was opened so there's still some left in the bank I mean like in the video Bank not in the actual bank but they are running out so I need to film here and I need to figure out a way so yes things are coming along just coming along a lot more slowly than I had hoped they would of course yeah if you're in the same boat forgive yourself forgive yourself for not being as productive as you see everyone else being on YouTube and TV and things we're all coping with this crisis so even the worst in one place in our homes we're all coping with it so you have to cope with it the way you need to it's it's it's a big crisis so be a little bit kinder to yourself take the time that you need try doing yoga my channel is always linked everywhere in the description and the cards and the videos and everything I will see you guys next time as soon as I possibly can stay well and stay safe bye
