 hey guys Katherine aka karema here and we are on a full-time quarantine here in New York it is absolutely crazy just I can't even put on the news at this point because it's just freaking me out okay so if you don't already know I'm on that medication and I'm on suboxone now Matt medication is medically assisted treatment I was an opiate addict and I'm no longer and I owe a lot of that to the fact that I'm on suboxone and I've been on it for a long time but anyway normally what I would do is I would go to my doctor on Friday and we'd sit in his office and chitchat for about 15 minutes and he'd give me my prescription I'd walk out and then I'd go to CVS drop it off of it and I get my prescription but obviously that is not going to happen that easily today so one of the main reasons that I wanted to make this difficult was to share the experience with you of exactly like what's going to be happening with that but I also wanted to just show you what life is like under not it's not called quarantine but just under a shelter in place or whatever it's called here in New York where the coronavirus is like at its apps no I made a video before like in the beginning of my youtube career or whatever you want to call it and it was about wanting to come off of suboxone because just in case we ever got into a zombie apocalypse I wanted to be prepared because like you're in a zombie apocalypse or something is crazy happening there's two things that are gonna stop you number one if you wear contacts because you're not gonna be able to get new pairs of contacts and your glasses could break and number two if you're on some sort of like life-saving medication like my mother's a diabetic like perfect example like so I just wanted to be able to get off of the box-room just for the fact like if there ever was a zombie apocalypse well it's so crazy because that time has kind of come right so honestly if you're feeling during this like so much pressure so much anxiety so much hopelessness that you want to relapse like you feel like there's nothing left for you about to relapse oh my god please just call somebody message me here and I will call you and you know we'll get you back on track relapsing is literally the worst thing that you could do right now I put out a video about heroin and opiates and the coronavirus don't do it don't take drugs right now bad bad bad bad bad try and quit you know this is this is a good time to quit but you know I'm saying this all but even me for myself like I have feelings like that too like oh my god like this is so hopeless oh I just I want to go out and I want to use I don't really because I have a lot of time as a ready bail I you know I have a supportive family like I don't really want to do that or to get there but it it is like fleeting in my mind like just it brings up a lot of old thoughts what we're in right now and you know be like being here and the only thing that I can do is obviously like watching TV watching YouTube and I've been watching a lot of social media and because of that because like I'm like on social media all the time it brings up old thoughts of like inadequacy like I'm so one thing that I was doing before the you know everything happened with coronavirus and the quarantine and New York just becoming a very shut down state was I was reading wrote Clausen's the comeback code and I it is the most amazing book literally so amazing for self-help I absolutely adore it I absolutely adore ro she's freaking awesome and I love her book and I love it's taught me so much but kind of you know the day that everything happened and like we were told like that we had to Coronado quarantine and we were told that we had to stay home and everything like that I kind of stopped reading and you know I don't want to work on myself almost like I want to be upset and say it so who screwed up like I don't want to work on myself right now I want to wallow and be upset at everything and that's just so pointless right okay so I just got off the phone with um the lady from my doctor's office and she said that everything is good to go that the doctors gonna give me a call we're gonna chitchat and then either he's gonna send it electronically or I'm gonna go to the there to pick it out so I'm gonna find out exactly what that is in probably an hour an hour and a half something like that so I just wanted to give you one last update I'm in the bathroom and we've got this horrible fluorescent light because that was just the only put space that I could go to where I was just like free of my family and I can be on my loan you know be on my own and talk to you guys so I just wanted to let you know exactly what happened so I just got off the phone with my doctor a few minutes ago and he said to me um it was a five minute phone call he was like is there anything going on with your prescription is there anything that's different is there anything that I should know about and I said no no no he said is are you sick are you you know had like have you been feeling you know anything any of the symptoms of coronavirus or anything like that and i said no to that he said sick in any way no and then he was just like okay just come and pick up the prescription whenever you can like if you could do that today do it I'm going to wait until Monday because my pharmacy has it that I should pick it up like seven days after the actual prescription so um so I'm going to go on Monday so two things number one this video is going to be to to be continued if you want to know the rest if you want to know if I actually got this stuff let me know and I'll do another one and I'll let you know how it's ER but as far as just the basics go it's alright man you know the zombie apocalypse is happening but I still have if you actually saw the video of me it was one of the first videos that I did on suboxone taper or on quitting suboxone I pretty much said like in a zombie apocalypse or an apocalypse of any sort and a coronavirus apocalypse you want to be able to like just like be free of everything not have addictions not have glasses or contacts because you'll be most likely to be able to fight off the zombies this is like the perfect example of that like I don't necessarily want to go out of my home and go get this prescription on Monday but it's like I kind of have to because if I don't how am I going to function oh so um obviously I'm very curious as to what's going on with you guys if you weren't able to pick up your prescriptions if you're worried about it what's going on in your states to New York is the worst of the worst of the worst there's I think it's like 10,000 people already got the virus oh my god there was oh my god it's crazy all of the nursing homes the people are all dying there's gonna be no people left in the nursing homes um Suffolk County was like three people yes three people this morning so um so yeah there are obviously some areas that are more hard than others and New York I think is one of the areas that it's getting really really really a very hard hit so let me know what's going on with you guys and you guys is Nick of the woods and how you're handling your math medications if you're getting them whatever I was just so curious so and if you want it to be continued let me thank you so much for watching and we will see you next time
