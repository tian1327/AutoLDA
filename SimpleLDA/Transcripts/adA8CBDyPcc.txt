 you know what is good guys welcome back to another video happy Friday today's video is a little bit different than what we usually do so like about a month ago I don't know if you guys saw the video but I was filming with some people and we were doing like a documentary on me and that documentary is finally out so I figured I would share that with you since I don't have any specific content to show you because this whole quarantine thing so today I want to show you guys this freakin documentary and I hope that you guys enjoy it please let me know what you guys think I hope that all of you enjoy it and well let's just watch this freaking documentary I'm gonna get dust I'm not warmed up at all - three - three - I thought you were gonna choose something else like doing that like no why'd he do that my name is Danny Torres I was born in South America and I grew up in Texas and Florida yeah which is weird I've been vegan for about six years now and it all started because one late night I was watching YouTube videos and kind of just like came across it I couldn't find a good enough reason not to be vegan all the reasons for being vegan kind of like aligned with my morals go on my board and I noticed that with skating whoo I stopped feeling as heavy I was able to skate for longer and just have way more energy more sighs I feel like out front board it first tried but I want to get this back board yeah I'm doing like that I just start filling for my video huh yeah you can film it they don't you guys don't have to the first initial reason why I started making YouTube videos is because I wanted to like talk about veganism and like inform people about veganism these are my new shoes they are all vegan that's right I said vegan and cheese in the same sentence vegan mac and cheese I don't really talk about that as much on my youtube channel anymore but I still like to portray this like compassionate person that I am I talk a lot about progression and not letting other people bring you down those skating circle reels is not my strong suit so I'm kind of relieved that it was first try and we're gonna walk away with that little bit of progression today  I was never conscious about my decisions I always littered I always like just left stuff everywhere so when I first went vegan people were like dude what are you like you don't care about any of that stuff and then as I stuck with it people started not hanging out with me as much and they started looking at me as like gay and like I was they started to calm you at all the time being a man in today's society you have to play this role of just being this like tough guy and you're just strong and you eat all this meat and when I went vegan I realized that a true man is somebody who really cares about you know the future of the earth that his children are gonna be on bone Appetit to my friend every word every time somebody hasn't I always say like yo I have the bomb is tofu where is it I think that people people like to complicate things they like to think oh man vegan is hard because I've never cooked it that way before but it's really honestly it's the same thing like rice is something you eat whether you're vegan or not you know onions is something you eat broccoli the same thing you know what I mean the only thing that's different about this meal is is the tofu but it's something as simple as like learning something new honestly like I I hate doing things and if it's something that I could learn to do something that anybody could really learn to do they will each go in a Tupperware and get inspired to skate I've had her for like a year and a half I found her when she was about like six or eight weeks and I found her at the skate park it was like my miracle kitty and I wasn't ever gonna keep her and I know keep here we're best friends we're best friends even though you all you do is bite me and make me bleach just made me bleed pretty bad too that was like a big thing for me I was like wow I've like like I wouldn't eat my dog like why would I eat another animal it didn't make sense to pick and choose which animals to love and which ones to eat I think mainly it's just important to to live your like morals your values you know what I mean like it's not it's not only about your health or wanting to do good for the environment or or not wanting to harm animals you know it's just like in terms of everything like it's it's an animal rights issue it's like an environmental issue it's a human rights issue it's everything if it wasn't for going vegan I probably wouldn't care about any of it and it wasn't until all that that I finally realized like there's more to life than just like myself you know  so let me know what you all think about this documentary and I will see you all next Friday for another video also if you guys want to post like random little videos throughout the week let me know I'd be glad to do that as well leave me some
