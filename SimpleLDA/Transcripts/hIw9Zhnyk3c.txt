what's up guys welcome back to the channel this video is actually not really for the whole world to see for the most part this video is being made for my family and my friends so you know some guys have been calling me and saying hey what's going on you know how you doing what are you even up to you so instead of you know having a long conversation about what we're doing and what we've done I'm just gonna make a video and then all my family and friends can just watch this video alright so and then of course some of my subscribers out there can learn some things or two of what I've been doing as well so as you could see we have been prepping you know the coronavirus basically came onto the scene back in January at least for me anyways I know it was discovered in 2019 hence the name Cove it 19 that's 2019 was when it was discovered in December I think it was the official first case but we didn't really hear it in the mainstream until January when I was at shot show right then and there when they said there was a outbreak in in China similar to SARS I already knew that was a red flag boom my red flag went up and I was like okay there's a lot of Asians and a lot of Chinese in Las Vegas at that time during the Lunar New Year and every Hotel in Vegas if you don't know caters see the Chinese out there and everything was you know decked out in red and gold coins and statues of animals so they were trying to lure a lot of Chinese gamblers into every one of the lobbies and casinos down there in Las Vegas while I was down there at shot show and then of course a lot of us guys who go to shot show every every year we were already you know weary of getting the crud so just on a normal day we were you know fearful of getting sick getting the regular flu or some kind of germ of some type so I was already walking around with my hand sanitizer without even knowing a thing about coronavirus you know shakin hands touching guns and then washing my hands or putting sanitizer on my hands literally every booth that I was at so that helped for for not getting sick and then when the news about the corona virus hit I even made a video of it when I was in in that shot show ssangsun about corona virus and some dude was coughing in front of me on the escalator oh yeah that's right that's the big news while I'm at SHOT Show I found out about virus coming out of coming out of China yeah everybody's scared to get sick under miss coronavirus wanna wear masks yeah I was like okay this this sucks so I left Vegas to come home back to Reno and I was the only person at the Las Vegas Airport that bought an n95 mask that was on the shelf they had some and I bought it for five bucks for one mask which I thought was ridiculous at the time but I bought it and I was the only one wearing a mask I even took a picture and put it on Instagram and people were looking at me like I was crazy and they were moving away from me because I'm Asian I got Asian eyeballs I got slanted eyes so people were like I was like it was like parting the Red Sea it was great people were staying away from me at the airport it was awesome I wrote on the plane with the mask on all the way back to Reno and then as soon as I got back to Reno this was towards the end of January now I told my wife I was like hey something weirds going on in China and we get everything from China so it's a matter of time before it comes here maybe we should stock up on things that we normally buy anyways and my wife you know she's a good wife she's that yep that makes sense let's go out and buy more of what we already eat so we bought more rice you got two bags of rice and we still have some more in a pantry inside the house this is just in the garage we bought some beans so if we want to make some burritos or whatever and I bought a big bag of flour if you want to make some tortillas or pizza or whatever and if we bought a bunch of spam you probably can't see it but there's more spam in the back so all the way to the top all the way deep we have spam for months if we ration it out make some spam and rice musubi whatever you can make all kinds of cool stuff with spam and of course I already had the MREs because I'm a pseudo prepper I'm already kind of a paranoid guy so I had my reason hand from a couple years ago those are good I think the shelf life on those are good for like 20 years and then I also bought this freeze-dried food about this a couple years ago as well I think I bought this back in 2012 so this has been a trusty companion with me for several years as well it's always good to have this stuff on hand you yeah coronavirus today what is it going to be tomorrow you know I remember when it was y2k and h1n1 and SARS and merge and bola there's always something guys so it's always good to have some MREs some freeze-dried food and rice and whatever canned goods I have a whole pantry of canned goods in the house I've got a water container up there if I need to go pick up some water from the there's a little pond behind our house that has some tilapia in there and who knows maybe some trout too for lucky it's a football sized pond behind our house if the guys at the water treatment plant gets sick and they can't run the water system we have water here in my neighborhood we also got this this jerry camp it has a filter in that inside there and they use these filters these jerry cans in africa because they got bugs in africa so awesome thing to have I've had that for a couple years as well just sitting around just in case I can bring this with us everywhere anywhere we go if we bug out not that I want to bug out but if we had to bug out and there's a lot of places with water around here put the water inside this jug and then I can purify thousands of gallons with that one container right there so my family has water not worried about it this box is full of my old Frollo gear from back in the days back in them 2009 I still have it so they have a full-face gas mask with canisters boots Tyvek suit all that stuff it's all in there if I needed sadly I only have one set for me but hey at least I have something right ramen noodle or Simon got a bunch of that and we again we have more inside the pantry in the house this is out in the garage some Gatorade for electrolytes like you're vomiting out of your butthole you got a hydro man and then 20 cases of water again I bought this stuff back in February first guys everybody was looking at me like I was crazy I mean I already had eight cases in the house that's how I roll I always have eight cases of water anyways because I just like to have it so it's better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it right so then I just went out and bought a bunch more cases to make it a full twenty and that's not a long-term solution that's obviously a short-term solution but hey I got it you know we don't have to fight at the Costco or Sam's Club and wait in long lines and expose ourselves to whatever bugs are out there we have it so we don't have to worry so I highly suggest that you do the same next time because it's too late now you're gonna be out there trying to fight for stuff now it's too late there's my jump starter I caught that a couple years ago for overnight Expo it's got USB ports and a jumper cable an LED light I always keep that in the vehicle it's sitting in the garage right now because I need to charge it up and then this this is a 7 cubic foot chest freezer and we bought this before the president officially said that we were in a national emergency so bunch of hot dogs Portuguese sausage like tons of Portuguese sausage is probably at least over a dozen of them in there hamburger hot dogs hot dogs you're cheap man there were only like 99 cents a pack we have more hamburger we just bought today but yeah we got hamburger chicken pork fish tortillas just all kinds as to all there's some lasagna there because I like lasagna and we still got room to fill this thing up and we still have another half of the chest to go to fill it up if we really want to well yeah I mean it's always good to have a fridge or a freezer in your garage this was only a hundred and sixty nine bucks at Sam's Club so probably not available now but at the time I bought it nobody wanted them so yeah it's good to think ahead right we also got a bunch of toilet tissues or bath tissues or toilet paper again I bought this a long long long before it was even a meme we we already had one I just picked up another one so we got toilet paper and by the way guys if you run out of toilet paper just wash your butt the way Jesus did people have been wiping their butts with fresh water for thousands of years you don't need toilet paper it's a convenience but you don't need it guys when you're dealing with germs and viruses you got to keep stuff clean my wife got this instapass for Christmas from auntie Cathy and if you don't know about this you can make all kinds of good stuff whether in stewpot this is the big boy two stews and soups a dough ball of course since we're Filipino we don't just have one rice cooker we got two and of course you know my wife had to have Aloha show you a bunch of oil for cooking Filipinos got to have vinegar we got a two vinegars what you know about Crisco I double-checked my camping gear and this is just the no-frills camp stove that a lot of people have it usually runs off those little green propane bottles the small ones did you plug in right here well those don't last too long so what I did was I went to I think it was a Home Depot either a home depot or lowes and bought this adapter hose and what it is is a hose it just plugs in here where you normally put the green bottle and then it has the appropriate attachment point for this 20-pound propane tank so now I can use my camp stove like a regular kitchen stove I mean this thing could probably be used morning noon and night three meals a day for probably a month if not longer depending on how we use it and it's still portable I can throw it in the back of the truck the tank can fit in here the stove can fit in here and then I just carry that tote to move it around if we had to go camp out somewhere aka bug-out up at the lake or something we're set for easily a month or so as far as cooking goes and if I wanted to conserve the propane and not even use it at all and or if it just runs out BAM we got this old fire pit that was actually left here when we bought the house I was gonna throw it away because it's damaged it doesn't have anymore tiles around the edges but it's still pretty solid in the base it's all metal and it has a grate in there so I could use this as a ghetto camp stove I could either use wood to cook what the skillets or just go ahead and use charcoal the old-fashioned way with some lighter fluid there I collected these cast iron skillets over the years this is a big skillet for cooking potatoes when we're camping and then of course a Dutch oven if you don't know about this thing has all kinds of things you can do with the Dutch oven so it makes twos you could bake with it if you wanted to so yeah I mean just like grandpa used to do back in the old days you know he'd slaughter a goat and him and his friends he'd go in the backyard and cook on barbecues not much different than this so yeah that's a camping / emergency way to cook food in case I don't know the gas system gets compromised somehow highly unlikely again gas systems not going to go down but you never know I mean Murphy's Law right nowadays anything could happen it's nice to be prepared now as far as lighting goes when it gets dark we do have some candles but I honestly have a ton of flashlights and yeah these are all des Thiam rechargeable lithium ion rechargeable battery flashlights so I think I got lighting covered for a very long time I have chargers for all these as well I even have a solar panel and a battery bank to charge these as well so yeah we're covered on the lighting that's a lot of flashlights at the old house in Vegas I had a steel security door out front this house didn't come with one but it did come with obviously a pretty heavy-duty front door in general probably fire rated I'm sure and I just bought this $20 brace to keep knucklehead so I'm just kicking in our front door could they still kick it in he a sure you still could but this will buy you some time to clear the crud out of your eyes at two o'clock in the morning and get to your guns and let's speak into guns let's go see which guns I got for home defense anyways so for personal defense this is my wife's gun it's a canik tp9 sfx long slide basically a competition ready gun and this is her home defense gun to protect the babies if I'm not here for whatever reason or she needs to back me up and the reason why we actually chose this or she actually likes this is because of this right here to see that charging handle some of you guys know she severed her left thumb completely the ligament was completely severed and had to be repaired so she's kind of handicapped on her left hand so she needs that that assistance with that charging handle so that's really the biggest reason why she uses this gun plus she likes the red dot because they're gonna read that on there and then with this set up here it's got the Taylor freelance magazine extension so that magazine holds 22 rounds and then I just have this old-school battle built nothing high-speed low-drag about this I know there's $600 rigs out there those really expensive rigs I don't have that this is a 15 dollar battle belt with a $2.00 old-school police belt and yeah I just rigged it up over the years nothing nothing high-speed it has built this polymer 89 millimeter it's basically a Glock 17 with a hollow stone on there titanium red dot in a Kydex holster spare mags obviously everything is full because right now right about now is a dumb time to have em magazines my Oh light warrior and then 30 round magazine for the AR pistol so I've got a little extra rounds there and of course in the back I have two tourniquets some QuikClot chest seals and some other medical stuff in there yeah this is my ar-15 pistol it's a precision pistol I built actually quite a few years ago now ambidextrous controls about the SP tactical brace Trijicon mro on there that it can stay on for like I don't know four or five years something like that but I love this thing it's a little seven and a half inch barrel five five six pistol Indian Creek design blast shield in the front Oh light weapon light on top and uh yeah this is great because it's nice and compact lightweight I can shoot it one-handed if I had to I can carry my three-year-old if I had to and still shoot this thing relatively good put effective rounds downrange even with my three-year-old in my left hand so that's nice have your mags loaded and then of course I have a backup platform I love my aks yes I'm an AR guy but I'm also an 8k guy I love my any case so Romanian sar1 old-school and then I have the worcester 10uf or under folder and all the AKA mags are full at a make a drum as well all full I believe every house should have a shotgun so that's a 12-gauge s a Mossberg I think that's the partner 20 inch with the extended tube well yeah those are the guns for personal defense and I also have some extra ammo in the garage to back these things up so we're good to go when it comes to Marauders and home invaders and looters and if you think I'm over the top on this you remember what I do for a living guys it's no joke I've already ran into at least one guy here in Reno that told me right to my face I don't need to prep I'll kill you and take all your food and all your guns that's what he said of course he was joking but as you know with every joke there's a little bit of truth in there so don't think for a second there's not fringe people out there on a good day that already live on the fringe you turn off all services like police they're not coming there's no cell phones for whatever reason there's no emergency services and those people who already live on the fringe on a good day are gonna turn into full fledge wild animals when there's no police coming to save you so you need to save yourself this is not over the top 30 days ago Italy barely had a couple people dead fast-forward 30 days they have over 3,000 dead in 30 days so things can change just like that and I'm not trying to scare anyone I'm just saying you know you got to be realistic I have babies to think of I have a wife and kids to think of and I will do everything I have to do to defend them if someone comes kicking my door two in the morning to try to take my food and guns just like the guy said I'll take your food and guns I'll just kill you and take your food and guns I don't need to prep really well I hope not guy I hope not because I trained my wife to shoot I trained my son to shoot and it's not gonna be easy we're gonna just lay down here and let you take what we got I think I got a little bit of ammo to last me for a while I just picked up that case of five five six X m193 so yeah I got a little bit of animal too so it's always good to have this stuff it's sometimes it's better than gold because you can't shoot gold also on the protection side we got soft armor for my wife over there and then I have rifle plates for me these are AR 500 steel plates with the small purchase just like small anti small coating and the trauma plates these are like family it's underneath and I actually bought these on sale on New Year's 2020 or I guess it would be 2019 going into 2020 I bought these on sale from ar500 really dirt cheap I was like I think I was like 150 for the whole set so front and back shooter cut and then it came with the carrier as well it's pretty nice so I got to put some pouches on there some tourniquets and whatnot but yeah an armor for the family and lastly as a lot of you guys know I sold the old two wheel drive Hyundai that I bought for 6,000 bucks a few years ago which was my commuter car in Vegas moved up here to the Reno area and upgraded to a Toyota Tundra 4x4 TRD and absolutely loved it and if your honor wondering why I went with the the double cab versus the Crewmax it's because the double cab has a six and a half foot bed that's what I wanted six and a half foot chicken head TRD 4x4 off-road edition so yeah love this thing doesn't it doesn't get the greatest miles per gallon I think it's like 15 miles per gallon but man talk about confidence I just drove through a storm the other day that dumped 10 feet of snow up in Tahoe I had to drive through that storm on the highways complete whiteout almost and I felt so comfortable in this thing all right so to my friends and families I love you guys and I hope you guys are doing well you not to worry about us out here in Reno we're doing good I've taken care of pretty much everything I need to take care of we are doing just fine so don't worry about us I'm more worried about you guys hopefully you guys are prepared to wait this thing out for a couple weeks it'll blow over we're gonna get past through the past all of this and I will be fine just got to stay clean avoid people wash their hands wear your mask social distancing and let this virus run its course I know the media is making it sound like worse than it is and trying to hype it up every second they're trying to make it sound like oh the apocalypse it's not we're gonna survive this it's just we live in an age of instant media so there's there's people out there that want a balls on their TV channel that's really what it is and to all my viewers out there who just came along for entertainment purposes I love you guys too I hope you guys are doing well hope your families are doing well I hope you're prepped to wait this out again like I said don't worry it probably looks worse than it is it's just that we've never gone through anything like this before so it's shocking to our system but we'll be fine all right guys hit that like button to support my channel appreciate it helps me out a lot ring that Bell because you never know what I'm going to upload leave a comment below let me know what you guys think about my preps what I got right which liked what I could work on of course everybody needs something to work on no one's perfect when they're prepping and well unless you're a millionaire and you got money up too young yang but I know I'd like to have a solar system some kind of solar power bank my cousin in California he has a power bank on his house which I'm so jealous if the grid goes down his house actually has a battery in his garage I think and solar power to charge it so he's good to go I'm actually really jealous I'd also like to have well that'd be awesome I don't have a well and a windmill would be cool too I don't have a windmill so anyway there's all kinds of things I wouldn't mind having a helicopter or a jet or tank for that matter yeah there's a lot of things that I could do difference but this is what I'm doing this is what I got on the budgets that I have and yeah I'm pretty comfortable all right guys I hope you guys are doing well too everybody take care and yeah we'll get through this have a good one guys
