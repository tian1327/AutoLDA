hello members of the wireless my name is like TV Adrianna I'm the chair of a young lawyer section at least for the next few months as we continue to get through this sort of crazy change in our in our pattern of life we had a lot of programming set up for the month of March and April and May May was gonna end with our alumni event we're gonna invite several alumni to come back and join up with us and then you know have our end of the year event that one is still sort of pending so I guess stay put but obviously this covalent self-oscillation has impacted us in many ways and so what we're trying to do with yl s is sort of providing this video content so that you know that you're not alone in self isolation and in trying to cope with whatever means you're doing it so we're trying to have a little fun with it I guess and so the questions are you know how is this impacting you how what are you doing to sort of cope with with all of us especially you know having to run your own business electronically or remotely and you know what what can you do to sort of change a lot of what's affecting you so really this whole transition has been I guess easier for me because most of my practice is virtual so I use a lot of software where I talk to clients give you a little or preview here so it's case peer they can talk to me if yeah there we can text each other through there also I use Microsoft teams to be able to talk to my staff talk to my team we use oome you slack so you know we've been relatively tech savvy from beginnings which has made it a lot easier for us to work from home so we haven't really missed a beat there the areas where this has impacted us the major part is there you know there's no chord there's no trials as I'm sure you all know so and you know another area is my clients just can't see their doctors so for many reasons either the doctors clinics are closed or it can't provide remote therapy which some are doing and my clients are so scared they're scared to go to these facilities they're scared to expose themselves to you know the virus and so on which is totally understandable so what we're trying to do really is you know for those that do need assistance is to try to find facilities that are being extra careful for them and find facilities that are doing some of this virtual therapy that I guess had been a thing so malai before this whole corona scare deal but now you know it's becoming more and more so you know I know that the things are different things are changing for folks just want to know hang in there we're all gonna get through this just make sure that you stay safe don't go out I know that there's a lot of temptation to do that and to my officers out there I love it I miss you take everybody
