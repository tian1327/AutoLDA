oh hey lemme take an ingot yeah yeah the market and get right into it aleppo facility to be naked oh yeah keep 2,500 2,600 I'm actually looking for something like this for my bedside table but the problem is that I'm not sure how big it is I'm Susan this is today is the second time I leave the house ever since logged on started it felt very nice very scary but very nice that I've got to breathe I've been seeing the same faces for what day is it now there is something for the something I don't know I've been waking up to the same face is going to sleep with the same faces I need a break to understand I want to turn this plague today and all I had was my sanitizer it's not that big but it's actually big I'm really surprised that it actually did fit in this day but I had a son as high as I and my bank card earphones and a few okay mine lip therapy DD center if he knows I know why I have cash on me this is probably the change from when I like to get the bag betcha I'm going to we went to UM Janis back because my mom wanted to get check suits because she hasn't been getting them anyway in milling more incentive yesterday they went to thinking no the day before yesterday they went to sent him and main Lane and she couldn't get anything but she got some for us so today we went to Jovic and luckily she found a few she got a few so we got there and then I the only reason why I went with them was because I needed needed to go to kicks I just wanted to get myself a curl a because I did say that I want to curl this hey I'm very bored I need to do something and actually there's a store in sinchon that is open and they sell paints and canvas and all of that fun stuff so I think I think I think I really want to get that for myself and I couldn't get them today because I was with my dad and he was like you wasted money and we need to save you in this time because I'm not gonna hear that so that's why I didn't get them today I'm probably going to bake my mom tomorrow for us to go to sensual man just to get them and then come back and be in lockdown class now but yeah that's what I wanted to get but I delegate so I went to just kill I might do can we do at a meal firstly I got what I wanted I got this killer actually wanted a pink one because I'm not really into purple pebble is not really a cute color but it's whatever I got this one from chicks for let me tell you the price just in case you want to get it this is the chopstick color and it retails for 275 so this is 275 and there's only one color which is unweaned because what if you're like me and you don't like purple I think this is my first killer oh I do have a killer panic it's not I don't like how it goes I don't like how it goes so it comes up glance also you don't you don't burn cute very cute okay it only comes with one but still cute though I also got these chili beef both on I got both of them in Chile because I just like chili both on and then I got this kiss blue because my jus the glue that I use is finished let me show you how it looks every time I apply makeup I have to squeeze the out of it well not every time I apply makeup every time I will ashes this is the girls using this is the huda beauty - it's finished I need anything yeah I stole my do in here and my eyelashes I stick to them here well only because they don't come with okay they do come with the case I just threw it away so I decided to try this kiss do because a lot of girls from Sweden recommend this because yeah the useless not because a lot of girls from Chile I use these this kind of do and they do recommend it so I really hope it does speak I bought a glue the last time I needed glue which is I don't know in this is the - I got and this is the eyelid glue from clicks it does not work it does not stick it's very hmm I don't know I I don't I I wouldn't recommend it I would urge you to save your money and not buy this if it if it works for you then please tell me what you do but I'm not really like about to try it again I'm not about to give it a second chance I tried it and it doesn't work so I'm not even sure why I'm still keeping it but yeah this is still full I used it once while trying it and it did not work and I never went back so probably gonna throw me out if it's my sister so that she can try and if it works for her then I'll give it to her but if it doesn't I'm probably gonna sorta doing so I'm gonna try this out and I'll tell you guys if it it is the one or not so yeah this is the kiss it Spy Kids right there it's my kiss and okay it's the kiss strip I like you this was six to eight so this is 68 I also got my self tanner because I had fear for myself the middle and been obsessed with the chocolate ever since lockdown it started because my dad my snake every time he goes to the grocery store and he finds my little sister out of my knees this chocolate and I've been stealing them I'm kind of obsessed love love love it and then I got okay I've got one mask this time because I'm not sure about trying different masks because I'm not sure if it's effective but you see them using a different mask tomorrow I use a different one but they do all have different purposes so I ain't sure if it's safe for my skin because my skin is it's not that sensitive but it's sensitive and I don't want to introduce a lot of products to my skin because I'm not going to be able to maintain all those products since then so I just got the exfoliating apricot scrub mask from texture so this is probably the trend or less and then I got these um lashes these are the Lulu lashes by pinky goat this is my first time using this brand and I bought them because I love the density of it this is these are the type of lashes I would weigh there we go I'm sorry this is not focusing yeah these are the type of flashes I would be I got myself Mesilla water because I ran out these are the special wipes from clips they are 60 and I'm really glad I got these ones that opened I have an opening I'll open it conject yeah that have an opening so an MIT likely are too dry I just pour this in here so they can have nice moisture and they not like very hash to my skin because if they're dry the limit is like forcing them onto my skin I also got and there's what do you call this actually nail polish remover because I've been applying nail polish since saloons are closed and I don't wanna use those fake nails from ticks because they look really and very I don't know they just don't look cute for me that's my opinion if you use them then they work for you they don't look for me so yeah that is all I got from  I could be the best thing in your life
