 we asked a policeman to get vegetables for us because we only get rice and pasta and we gave him money and apparently that's a crime now they are here to take up the full story of how we gave him money interrogated him for three hours and now two interrogating someone else from the house that goes a bit far now hey guys I'm hoop Vandemark and I'm on the road since two years with my puppy dog in a 1987 Russian all time I and I were driving from Argentina to Alaska I don't even get it you know because we gave some money to a police guy to buy some vegetables he lets vegetables and we just asked the police guy and a police guy said sure no problem I mean her not allowed then I assume he should tell us right yes mightor and it's very interesting because they do speak a little Spanish now they're asking like direct questions and after explaining whole story which I definitely cannot I heard that policeman offered to buy fruits and vegetables for us and they would give the money to the policeman to buy fruits and vegetables for us pay attention this is a big you know there's something interesting about these things is that you know I I don't want to be here I rather do something else but I mean she also doesn't want to be here you know so basically we're having a conversation with two people actually don't want to be yourself I'm just trying to make the best out of it in the face of it given our officiating thinking interfaces pedo posture urinary tract on our little sentimental - what I am consulting I must say that on March 24th 2020 I do not remember the exact time but I gave money to buy fruits and vegetables to be honest I do not remember where I was at that time in the bedroom or in the room he stated that I heard that the policeman who was outside offered to buy if he gave him money for them then I saw this up and I saw to some okay alright so with the translation I found out why this is happening it is because a policeman is not allowed to take money from civilians and that is why this is happening now in the virus situation we are having this hour-long per person questionnaire because the policeman is not allowed to do to keep to take to take money from civilians I thought it had something to do with the virus it has not this is a little bit ridiculous right I mean I understood policemen wanted to be nice in this situation to get fruits and vegetables for us and there was a shift change at that moment and when he was finishing his shift he told to the other guy hey okay the new the new guy that was was going to be in that vehicle over there cuz 24/7 somebody surveilling this place that nobody leaves and he said okay I'm just gonna get vegetables for them and then the other police guy said no you are not allowed that's not allowed you took money from other civilians and as what there was like an older policeman he just tried to help emphasize that like doing this whole questionnaire right now while the city is still in lockdown for another 7 days yeah I think is a bit that's a bit much a bit illogical ok I think I'm gonna have my next question this one yepper feet away yeah on the bonus ad number C feet much you're nervous yeah you mumbling less or no no it is evening and we have new people and I have to write again my I think they've made it in print but I don't understand I have to write my name is that any afternoon there was someone here totally protect protect and protection and right now did you give me the pen nobody is in protective where I am so confused was my passport number but whatever okay these are guys is John I have to say they are super friendly but it is confusing I am gonna wash my hands with soap though just to be sure instead of using beer pan I wanted to use my own band I actually have it with me where is it here is it however my pan is blue and their pan is black and they needed to have my autograph in a black pan if you like my videos subscribe
