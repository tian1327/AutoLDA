 so I decided to take it easy on the vlogging over the weekend in an attempt to keep some sort of structure even though it already feels like it's blending together so Friday night I did bust into that little bottle of Prosecco after olive went to bed it was cute my friend Gabby sent me this picture of her drinking this adorable and she said very tasty pink wine that her boyfriend had picked up for her Quinn and I are not big drinkers we really only social drink so when we're out and about so we don't have a lot of stuff in the house to like make or mix drinks and I discovered that I don't like the taste of Prosecco on its own so I mixed it with one of the few drinks we have in the house orange soda you know desperate times and actually it wasn't half bad so I had a glass before bed and then slept the best I have in over a week Saturday morning woke up to the news that we had our first death in Arizona related to the virus so that was sad definitely a somber way to start the day and then just spent the day playing with some things okay I want which hand this one this one eaten some things cleaning we went for a walk in the afternoon which was nice Quinn's arm is feeling a lot better still sore he says but he's able to move it and stretch it and help out with olive again for the last week and a half he hasn't been able to pick her up so I've had to do more than usual it comes to taking care of her normally he gets her every morning and he puts her down every night which is a really nice break for me since I take care of her primarily throughout the day he still can't wrestle with her which she really misses cuz normally daddies like the jungle gym she climbs all over him but they'll go back to all that soon the other thing though is the antibiotics have really upset his stomach it's nice he's finally getting relief from his shoulder but now he's in constant discomfort the guy can't catch a break let's see what else I have found myself wondering about things like Easter coming up in the next few weeks yeah it's nothing dire considering the state of the world right now but it's still just trying to figure out this new norm that is very not normal and I did have to run an errand for work yesterday which I'm trying to consolidate those now and go as little as possible and I took a minute like I am right now to just sit in the car I'm just taking a minute to myself sitting in the car before heading home as much as I like being on top of each other all day all week it is nice to get a break I actually do really like having Quinn home and the company Quinn and I are the type of people who like to have a little independence in our relationship we think that's healthy for us of course we're each other's partners and go-to people and each other is number one but we also think it's good to still be an individual and have outlets outside of the house outside of each other the idea of getting married and then just morphing into one being is not our thing I think we support each other better when we don't lose our own individual person all that to say as much as I enjoy his company and having him home during the week I want other people's company too I'm missing my friends on this Saturday when I would normally be catching up with one of them over some sushi or noodles taking a moment to just be Hana and not wife / mother Hanna just me alright so I'm back in the car today because I'm going to run to the grocery store Quinn has been doing all the grocery shopping for us so I volunteered to go this time I haven't been yet since all of the panic buying which I've heard that is started to slow down so we'll see how it is today I need some ziplock bags which they don't have a lot and they're still totally out of toilet paper at least at this store many don't under - or a cold eel  while that was a little intense some stuff seemed pretty much fully stocked while other stuff was completely gone every aisle seemed to have something running low or empty I was able to get most of the stuff on my list except for toilet paper and olives oatmeal dinosaur eggs and I realized once I walked in wait I shouldn't be out here doing this I'm Asian I suddenly felt very self-conscious about that I know there's a lot of racism and xenophobia going on towards Asians people blaming us for the virus assuming all of us are carriers I didn't experience any personally today I felt insecure because I did notice avoidance people moving away and distancing but that could just because we're all trying to distance right now so I won't read into it if anything today was just a good reminder that I should be at home Quinn doesn't mind running the errands and I am apparently not feeling particularly safe out here Hey look we're matching I think we should call this matching Monday what do you think over the last couple weeks I've been waking up like every other day with a little bit of a sore throat nothing super painful and as the day goes on it goes away so I don't know what that's about it is allergy season here everything is blooming I've never really had allergies in my life but as I've gotten older especially the last few years I have noticed I've kind of been developing some get a little bit of the HG watery eyes and nose but very mild which I'm grateful about what are you drawing good job Wow looks great good job yep let me tell you these Jimmy Dean croissant sausage egg and cheese sandwiches are so good Quinn tried to buy me the healthier version of them which was like turkey sausage egg white only they were all right like these are like I could eat it every day and I pretty much have been I always have to cut her off a little piece cuz she likes it too whose birthday is it okay let's sing happy birthday to her happy birthday princess back after we've been playing for a couple hours it's time for a snack and TV and mommy can get ready I also give her a daily vitamin every day I tell her it's a treat and he's happy to eat it the Wi-Fi is really struggling back here it's been spotty the last couple weeks need help you go welcome it's annoying because I just recently upgraded to Cox's panoramic which is supposed to be the fastest strongest farthest reaching and it has not been any better it was raining a lot last week so I don't know if that was affecting it or if that's just a misconception and now that Quinn's home he's using a lot more Wi-Fi he has like three laptops this is the room farthest from the modem or router so it's always been a little spotty when I upgraded to panoramic they told me oh yeah that should be great for the size of your house but obviously not I know Cox also sells pods which you can put in any room that's supposed to be a Wi-Fi booster so maybe he'll hook into that alright so my laptop is working back here so we'll just do that not that she has to watch something but it gives me a little break I like to take a minute to run around the house and put things back where they belong will you do this all throughout the day it's amazing how in a 12 hours fan so much gets moved around especially now not being able to get out of the house and just let it be for a bit it seems extra chaotic but silver lining it keeps me moving this is my form of exercise right now alright now I can take a minute for myself for those of you curious about my lip colors for my throw on lip balm I always wear something tinted because I like a little bit of color I'm currently using the Burt's Bees in plumb I am a huge fan of this line I usually have three or four of their colors I have watermelon over here that I like all of you this is hers they also have a raspberry color which I really like for more of a bright pop and then a fig which is a little more muted I don't have either one of those right now I've lost them and then I go to lipstick which I am wearing most of the time is the Smashbox be legendary lipstick in Cognac with the sephora rouge gel lip liner in rose wine and those are what i have on right now i know some people don't like to wear so much color for an everyday look but i love it and then sometimes you add a little more depth and darken it a little I will add the Sephora Rouge gel lip liner in wild at heart I'll add some right now I'll really just line my lips with it so we were supposed to wear our matching shirts today she was telling me all weekend she wanted to wear them and this morning and then when I finally put it on her she threw a massive fit so she picked out one of her Halloween dresses it looks good baby one of the small areas in her life where she gets a little bit of control is picking out her outfit so I think she just wants to exercise that power sometimes or all the time I'm gonna clean it out cuz I don't know how long it's been since we've done that probably embarrassing to admit it look it's pretty gross back here behind all this - hopefully now when you see this stuff that background in my videos it won't look so nasty so I forgot that she woke up really or who you today around 5:15 5:20 she was being a little whiny and then she yawn and I remembered so I'm gonna get her down for a nap soon first feeding her a little lunch I haven't heard anything else from my work about shutting down so I guess it's business as usual Monday's just like for many others is the start of my work week last week was strange and distracting Quinn and I still need to figure out a new weekly routine now that we're both here trying to work I'm gonna do my best to refocus this week typically when olive naps I take that time to get as much work done as possible I work as hard and fast as I can because you know some days she gives me an hour and a half and then others it's like 45 minutes you look so cool I changed my top because we're playing outside now when we went for a walk and it's a little warm in the Sun and that shirt was hot salad break bubble machine is extra fun on a windy day so Quinn just got back from his appointment and they said that they think he's all clear it sounds like there was a little uncertainty like he was seeing a nurse who wasn't even gonna give him his results until he asked and she had to check his chart and it sounds like she might have been a little confused she said he's still gonna get a call from the doctor at some point but none of them are actually coming into the office right now so yeah really good news I'm still processing it what are you doing
