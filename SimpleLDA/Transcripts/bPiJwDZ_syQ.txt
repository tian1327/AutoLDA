 we're closed pretty empty speech those clothes and everything  so it's 9 times to play in the morning on a Sunday and usually it's really busy around this area mostly people go to the laundromat or supermarket but it's just a total ghost town those who wants to market that wasn't following the 20 people max or whatever protocol because they didn't have a sign saying 20 met people at his time but they're clearly lying I wish I recorded it it was just like they had the sign but it was so packed inside I didn't matter but I walked by it just now and it's a huge flying outside so I guess they got busted which is good I'm happy about that I put my mask down when there's no one near me it's kind of stuffy so the main thing that she's for me was that I am a super fortunate I can work remotely with my job and we also just want some visitors that I'm a part of so that's great for me I know many others aren't as fortunate my boyfriend got laid off you worked at a bar we knew was coming but on a bright side he wanted to quit he's gonna put in this two weeks like the week this all happened so I guess it's a blessing in disguise I guess but yeah it's if you like a solid like week we gonna have to get a schedule like a routine back I love structure I like going to the office Monday through Friday well now we work from home once a week now which is great but I like routine I like going in like a set amount of time and then go into the gym for another set of time and I'm going home and do whatever but now the world is like flipped upside down so I had to figure out you know when to wake up what to do when I wake up how long to work for it because I do work differently when I work from home for the office but I got it down pack now what else right through my free time what I do that working out while working out isn't that great I still gotta fix it it's a process so the sophomore about my routine so before the quarantine self-isolation I would wake up at around 755 walk people for like 10 to 15 minutes get ready really quick leave the house I like 8:35 a 40 I got really really quickly any post like going nuts but I would work until like 550 go to gym at like 6:10 stayed until 9:00 I took my time working out I got to stop doing that and I got home at around 9:30 eat something really quick watch YouTube or Netflix and go to bed the difference now is that I wake up at 8:50 which is nice but I don't like it I don't know I feel like it's too late actually you let me take that back because I'm a complain now and that's a wake up I like seven something again so I'll take that back so I get up by 8:50 walk eople really quick Nachi a scratch that we could buy a 50 stay in bed for like 10 minutes turn on my work computer see what's up talk to my associate that I feed people actually I feel evil during this time and then when I get us one way other thing I walk April between 9:00 and 9:30 so I usually try to eat cat food and then we work at also things one I lunch walk Ipoh again see there's a hoop in a house he poops in a puppy pad I'm trying to not let that happen we start braking at 5 which is good it's earlier now please you stop working like 5 25 30 and I just do nothing which is a problem I need to start working out again I only worked out twice there this whole thing I don't like it smoothie I'll do it today the problem is that I don't eat much anymore I eat way less than I did before I think the reason why is because I would eat sorry my hat is tired Matra sorry it's like I would eat a lot when I was probably listing because my body was always hungry but now I'm Way less hungry actually remind myself to eat so I talked to the DA Risha time working with to cut weight I'm trying to lose like 8 9 pounds for the competition and she said to start reminding through my phone which is whatever if you might make sense I'll do it so we'll see how that goes I want honest I'm gonna try today because I would like eat starting at 1:00 if I remind myself and that's really bad I got stuck that house I promised my building wise whatever who feeds the building like every Sunday that I would enjoy sleep I'm sorry I always put my mask here so coups okay that's cool so when we get back I put my mask here mask it's like kind of sad right now I put it here because if I don't I lose it I forget to wear it like 80% of the time so there's that I saw this tutorial online I'm sure you've seen it everywhere I think even like lamb brand new york times so it's a surreal I had append data in it but I just used to go scrap fabric from a t-shirt I cut up so you take two hair ties put it at the end like this and then you spread it out and then you put it over all up talk about it even though I didn't touch anything I wash my hands because it's good practice and you never know that's pretty much it so thanks for following me on my morning walk and a bit of my experience so I hope you stay safe out there wash your hands please wear some kind of mask not only for yourself but for others and have a great day bye you
