 good morning it is Saturday morning Oliver and I are here and he's eating a little bit of breakfast before jumping on his first ever zoom call which is kind of crazy but exciting and yeah I'm gonna make myself a little something to eat and see how this goes hey guys I am in my guest room and I am going to unbox the BMG Trading wholesale box that I purchased for myself yes I'm wearing it's the same thing I wear to bed I purchased I believe it's the North German revolve 25 piece box yeah so you can go and check that out on their website if you're interested in purchasing one I do have a coupon code that I believe works till I think it's for 20% off your order if you type in eld uch O which is L do Cho so I did not get this box for free I paid for this with my own money just to be you know completely transparent and all of that so I don't know what I got opened it I can't really see it but I'm hoping the boss here's my little receipt that I got there okay so first oh my gosh what looks like it's a dress this is Jack by BB Dakota it is a size 2 does have the tag on it but it doesn't see the price I'll look up all this stuff after the fact this is actually a really pretty dress oh no it's a jumpsuit okay hold on so here it is it ties at the waist and it has yeah pant legs so yeah I don't know the going rate for that these are all things I will research after the fact all right next item I got is another Jack by BB Dakota this is a size 2 again dress this is cute this is a one-state what is it faux leather leggings these are a size 2 it's a lot of size two dozen here this does have the original tag on it so it says $79 this is it gonna be a size two okay it's another Jack by VV Dakota hoping for a little bit more diverse group of brands this is size large dress know original price tag on there but it does have like the tag tag this is cute I would wear that this is heavy whatever it is is it gonna be jack it is Elliott I don't know what this point is I've never heard of it named Gotham dress black size small here's the tag what is this dress oh okay hold on here we go it looks like this goes around your neck oh it's form-fitting this very sexy I know I'm not displaying it the best guys sorry check out my eBay store and Poshmark closet if you want to see with all the photos later this is another Elliot I don't know this brand again oh this is cute it's got the little cutout on the side I kind of wish it almost didn't have that cutout because then it would be like more business appropriate but it does have this mesh panel you couldn't wear that to an office I'm guessing this is that same brand because although they're pieces are very heavy the fabric is super heavy on these this is an extra small it says men a midi dress I love that okay jack BB Dakota what he gonna be okay this is a size large oh it's basically the same as the black dress except this one's blue done um another are these gonna be like the only two brands I gave him here this one's called The Rapture maxi dress I'm glad but they're like maxi and MIDI dresses and not minis because I'm Marvin maxi and MIDI sort of gal oh this one's a jump no it looks like a jumpsuit it's just got this high slit in the middle there's that again some kind of interesting huh that's all and it's got this weird mesh overlay I don't know cute I guess I'm not gonna wear any other stuff I'm just filling it that's all I'm doing I'm selling it guys hmm a lot of the same brands so again um wish I had received a more diverse group hopefully some more of this is different what is this mm okay this is Jonathan sim sim CAI I've never heard of this I don't know what it is it looks like it's a swim talk I didn't maybe it's a top top it looks like a swim top I didn't know I was gonna get swim swim we're in here but okay this is Millie and it does have a little Nordstrom return tag there these were originally $395 there we go all right size six Millie pants this is a pair of sanctuary pants you know like price tag on them but they have all their tag tags all right I'm happy that it's changing up and it's not just those few brands on top what's this one oh I don't know how you pronounce it a star I've picked up this brand before I don't necessarily intentionally always pick it up but they do make cute stuff this is a jumpsuit this is really cute with the cutout in the front that's actually really cute I like that I think there's pockets too this is you've not heard of this brand sailor dress style Madonna this is another sanctuary item these are shorts that's good to have some shorts for the season another sanctuary item is it gonna be all sanctuary now these are some like mmm okay this is I don't know how you pronounce it on Z I think that's how you say it own zrz leggings no ATAG cute this is Vince Camuto size large top these are sage or which is sold at Nordstrom mm-hmm sauna is what 18w pants please hmm another Vince Camuto top with tags retail price on Vince Camuto is a little cray that one said $69 for that little top this another sanctuary item done and a couple more this is very sparkly again this brand not heard of that before maybe it's a revolt brand no price tag just the tag sequin it's pretty it's gonna be a while before somebody can wear this I'm gonna have to turn that little string there and why is this okay a free people something what are you hold on okay here we go is this the top or is this like lingerie that's the top I think and then I here's the back is it intimately frayed people yeah it is I mean so there's one item that I think is like a bikini top and then this piece I maybe he was under the impression that it was gonna be all clothing and not like lingerie or swimwear so yeah I don't know how I feel about the box yet because I don't know other brands and I need to comp everything but maybe I'll get back to you with the second opinion let me know what you think of it in the comments down below okay checking back in because I just went through and comped some of that items and I'm feeling good about what I got I definitely think that I'm gonna make my money back and probably like mm 2 to 3 times profit I'm thinking on all of this stuff so yeah good it was a good buy for me this is a porch pick up I had scheduled for an item I sold on Facebook marketplace it's an end table that sold for $65 who's gonna get that Luigi drink that is fancy strawberry gin a raspberry seltzer water you know and a nyquil hello everybody we're gonna let everyone filter in here everything seems to be working
