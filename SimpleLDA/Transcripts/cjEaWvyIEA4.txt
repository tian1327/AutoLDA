 I put my foot on his phone and slided out I was contemplating putting Nair and his shampoo bottle I must be feeling better today because I woke up with an appetite and like I've mentioned in my previous vlogs I haven't been eating very much because I've been having such major anxiety while I was in the kitchen this morning going through all of my fresh produce and whatever I have not eaten I was chopping up and I was freezing I didn't want them to go to waste so yeah I got that done and while I was chopping them up I used the produce that was about to go bad to make today's breakfast so there's a bunch of chopped veggies under here tablespoons of pasta sauce because we have a small family so usually only use maybe half a jar every time that I would cook with pasta sauce I have half of a mango here half of an avocado here and everything looks delicious I can't wait to eat I spent the morning talking to my twin sister and she wants to start making cooking videos again if you guys have not seen her channel it's linked on my channel home page to the side her and her daughter who is my goddaughter Denise make sure you guys go leave her some hearts or something to let her know that I sent you guys well I woke up because she called me so we were talking about just life and how things are probably not gonna go back to normal for a while I hope you guys are having a good morning though I'm gonna watch an episode of love island UK I love Indian food and I love watching British television I don't know what it is my neighbors upstairs just got here what should we call the treadmill people the treadmill people treadmill and then the crazy cooks on the other side even their freakin Chihuahua who weighs like 2 ounces is a stomper - for the love of God they work opposite hours he gets home around this time he leaves her work at like 10:00 p.m. but the lady of the house leaves Alex 7:00 a.m. she doesn't return until 7 p.m. constant noise all day long all night long it's too much but when the girls were here having margaritas I'm sure they wanted to stomp a hole in the floor because we were laughing screaming from laughter so hard that Angela almost threw up what shows have you guys been watching I want to know because I need something to watch we just finished the outsider like I've told you guys I kept calling it The Outsiders outside Dirar it's kind of like when people say I went to Nordstrom's it's quite strong I like cops tough cops first 48 locked up locked up right now 60 days in me and Judas love naked and afraid I know don't judge us it's on Nat Geo or is it discovery whatever the ozarks ozarks season 3 is coming out if it hasn't come out already I am obsessed with Jason Bateman I think he's hot I think it's a really good actor too but

questionable my baby daddy and mister questionable there are two different people so don't get it twisted I was at mr. questionable house and I slept over don't make me feel like Oh first of all he was so fine - he was on his phone but like I have chameleon eyes if you guys haven't noticed sometimes my eyes like take off and do whatever they want I was sitting like this on the couch and I saw him he was texting right one of my eyes is like trying to read what he was doing but I actually saw him punch in his passcode I'm like I'm gonna catch this we go to sleep and I wake up and I didn't hear his phone go off or anything like that because he's smart enough to not have his phone go off and he was like dead asleep and I crawled like a ninja like roll like a potato off of his bed go around the bed girl I'm literally like sneaking around the bed but anxiety I was experiencing and then put my foot under the bed yeah his frickin phone under the bed I put my foot on his phone and slided out now I have his phone right I'm like panicking just telling you the story because I remember how freaked out I was staring at him staring at his phone ah it was the stressful thing ever looking at him mm-hmm sweating girl I open it he's talking to some girl who looks like a Victoria's Secret model sidenote I was the fittest I've ever been in my entire life because I was trained Yuja to fight as a week and I was getting my whole life okay like I feel like I lived there I was dying i screenshot and everything so that when he looks at his phone he knows damn well what I saw having a panic attack because I'm seeing this naked hot girl on his phone and I put his phone back underneath where it was at so again this time I'm like you know we were sleeping like good Christians not touching each other anyway I put my shoes on in a scurry i tiptoe out of the room because I don't want to wake him up just yet I want to wake him up and scare the out of him at the same time I go over to the door grab it by its side and slam it I'll hurt myself slam it like a beast boom big big bang he jumped up so fast I'm like hitting the buttons on the elevator trying to get the hell out of there I feel like he's already on to me I'm not next to him obviously so I'm getting the hell out of there he's calling me calling calling calling calling calling calling calling calling a million times finally onto the phone and I don't even think I said anything I think he just was like I told him I was not going to like even waste any time with him like any time anywhere not in the living room not in the bed not down the street next to a tree no ma'am so PSA please leave the hot bartender alone I have so many stories about mr. questionable I can make an entirely different channel talking about this man and I haven't talked to him since the Lord knows what's going on with him he probably lost all to the hairs on his head I was contemplating putting Nair and his shampoo bottle that's how vain he was okay he was getting on my damn nerves now that I'm all pissed off I feel like it can go run a marathon Oh trust me there's gonna be more stories for you guys because I just got started I'm gonna get ready for my baby's return and I'll see you guys tomorrow
