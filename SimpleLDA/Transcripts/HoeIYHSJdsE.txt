 hi guys so tonight is Monday I thought I'd pick up the camera and do a little quarantine life vlog because I haven't been vlogging and it's like if there's ever a time to vlog it's now during a pandemic sometimes I think about it and I'm just like I can't believe that we're like this is actually happening like we're living it or something like this I keep a sentence a day journal I started that like months and months ago if you don't know what that is it's basically just a journal where you just write a sentence or two every day and I do skip news I'm not perfect at it but I've picked it back up again after taking a break or forgetting but just like writing about like things that are happening now with like everything closing and Madison being off of school and you know like there being like stickers on the grocery like supermarket floors telling you which way you can go and people wearing masks everywhere and stuff like that just like writing all that stuff down because you know it's kind of crazy that I just kind of crazy all this stuff that's happening right now and I just think that that would be cool to look back on myself or even like the kids or anybody who finds it when I'm dead you know to go back and look like using years from now you know what it was like but anyway so how are you guys all doing I hope you're all hanging in there and staying healthy and staying home still I know I feel like we've been staying home forever and I'm kind of getting to the point where I just wish we can go to like the park or yes or like home goods I'm really good morning I've been wanting to go to home goods since we moved you know to get some fun new stuff for the house and I wasn't even able to do that yet but whatever I mean at least we could still take walks and we've been having some nice by there so yay for that today is actually really nice like 60 degrees tomorrow is gonna be even nicer like 65 and we have this backyard now so I am grateful and thankful for that and we're just hanging in there and hopefully you guys are all doing the same and the only thing that I'm kind of struggling with this like I wish we could just stay home I wish Greg didn't have to because Greg's been the one going out like I haven't even gone out if he's been the one going to the grocery store and he went to Target and he's been the one going out but I wasn't gonna say oh I wish we could stock up more like I wish I could buy like 20 gallons of milk and like 20 loaves of bread because we do keep running out of that stuff and going out to get it and I just wish that we didn't like I wish we could literally stock up for three months but we can't keep that much food like where would we put it where we store it so it's kind of impossible like we keep having to run out here and there to get stuff so yeah kinda sucks I feel like I just want to lock ourselves in our house for three months but it's kind of unrealistic I guess when you have a family and kids and stuff new thing that we're doing is having our roof done we knew that we were going to have to like do our roof we didn't know if we were gonna have to like like we didn't know if we're gonna have to do the whole roof like replace the wood underneath or just like partially I don't know like a roof terms or whatever but the good news is we don't have to do the major roof replacement just the basic one you know but we are picking colors and I showed this on Instagram I was looking at that one but then I was thinking that we want to have we're gonna have like our siding we done and I want that to be white so when that when our whole house is white what would look good with a white house and Greg inaudible thinking that we should go doctor so it might just go with the charcoal one and then I was looking at that one but oh no that might still be too light and then there was this one over here too what I want to do though is take a walk later and actually you like a look at some of the houses and neighborhood and see you know like what color houses they are and what roofs what color roofs look good with the white houses and also as I ran into later I think what I'm gonna do right now because both boys are napping actually I think I'm gonna try to do some spackling for the first time have a putty knife here and then Greg brought this thing and I guess this was what he used when he speckled out the old house it's just like a sanding block I guess I don't know what you call that I got that too yeah yeah I still have not done anything with this wall we've lived here for two months now I think right yes two months and I still haven't done anything with this which is crazy because I hate this wall so much but there are some little holes from where they had nails there's another one so not too much tackling on this wall probably do that too so it shouldn't take too long and then I can finally paint this and you guys take a guess what color do you think I'm gonna do  I was not expecting this to be pink that is weird goes on pink dries or white when ready to see it and paint oh well that's convenient don't touch it no it smells familiar silly putty is that what it smells like  okay I am trying but I keep getting this line in here and I don't know why the heck put my fingerprint on it Madison says I should poke at it with my finger does that look better hey listen yeah is that what I should do okay so what I noticed was that like this first hole that we did wasn't like level like I had like a bump on the hole and like all of that pretty much do so what I've been doing is sanding it down I don't know if this is how to do it or what but standing it down so that it's more smooth and doesn't have like a lip right by the hole because I think that was making it like this back will go on like not smooth so here's one that Madison did Madison today after I like sanded it down and it looks better it doesn't have that line in it like this one has and she did that one - I don't know hopefully this is good after you know it dries and we sand it down so I just finished sanding in this wall down and finished spackling before I mean just sanded it down with this thingy let me show you who a mess that is me it is ridiculous like I didn't know that this was gonna be so messy I have to probably get out the vacuum to clean this all up but there is dust everywhere and over here but it's pretty smooth I think it's gonna be pretty good hopefully I don't know you could still kind of you could feel where it is but I don't know maybe I can go over some of this a little bit more and get like these are the first two I did this one and this one and then the rest of them I did more I guess I don't know I guess I can go over these again and make sure you can't feel any of the edge hi I'm so excited to get rid of this wall and I know probably a lot of you guys are excited to see it go too but then I realized that I'm not gonna be able to put the color on first I have to prime this wall first even though the paintin I have is paint and primer in one I feel like because this wall is such a crazy color and it's like a dark that I should probably prime it first so I have primer right you think yeah so yeah I don't know where this video is gonna go maybe I'll be painting this wall in this video or maybe not I don't know all right and this is happening it's a quarter after nine and it's now or never I've I'm in the mode of doing this wall so we're gonna say our final goodbyes to the Spanish painted popcorn yellow wall I never loved you you were always ugly and I won't be sad to see you go nope bye wall first I actually have to I think wipe down the entire wall because it's dirty when I was up there like doing that last little spot up there I could see just like cat hair stuck to the wall and like a dust and everything so I'm gonna do a quick wipe down of it hopefully that doesn't mess up like this or maybe I just I'll just go around these areas or something but yeah you know clean the wall first and then I'm just gonna do the primer tonight um so we're just using bare kitchen bath and trim primer so yeah  so I have my painting stuff I got a tray here that I've had forever came with the roller and this part of the roller and I think that's it I think that's all I came with right no it came with wait yeah I guess I came with this brush where's my brush out and then this is another brush that I used I usually these a long time ago when I painted the little apartment when I started painting in there and I really like this one so that's from Home Depot I got that one    so it's the next day now I want to show you what the wall looks like in the daytime so here it is tada it definitely needs a second coat at least on the part that was like dark yellow you can see it just didn't like I didn't cover completely but then over here this part was just like this yellow color that looks fine I just want to go you can see the difference I think you know yeah right there - there so that's good I should only need one coat on the rest of the kitchen but this one is definitely gonna need a second one and I wasn't planning on doing like coming down onto the baseboard at all but I was just like I'm gonna be painting the baseboard anyway and this was like baseboard primer - so I just brought it down onto the baseboard a little bit I don't know I think I might have to go in with like caulking or something to like smooth out some spots where it's weird like that I don't know maybe I'm being too particular I just want it to look like it's new but it's an old house so it's not gonna look like it's new but hopefully everything will just look better by the end of this and I'm realizing how much work this is gonna be to paint like the entire house like it was gonna take a long time and it's so hard to do when I'm just doing it like at night after everybody goes to sleep because like I'm tired by then and I can only go for like two hours or something like I wish I could just start in the morning and just work for hours like all day just paint but I can't do that I have to do it like little spurts and I can't do it during nap time like I've seen some articles on Pinterest where they're like paint your whole house during nap time but you know I don't know when they're gonna wake up I don't know when Noah's gonna wake up I don't want to be like in the middle and have him wake up and have to like hurry and clean up so I feel like it's just easier to do it when they're all in bed and when I know that you know I clean up when I want to clean up basically anyway hopefully it will actually feel like our house once we start getting some roofs done and painted I've realized that I don't have one room in this whole house that's done and I don't know what my issue is I've seen so many other youtubers move and I have like their rooms done and decorated and everything and Here I am and everything is just a wreck like that's but it's better than it was when we first move in moved in but like I said I don't have any room that's fully furnished I don't have any room with this clean like fully clean and painted and put together it's just it's not happening well it's happening it's just happening slowly so anyway I'm gonna wrap this up here I kind of broke my camera a little bit last night I had it sitting like on the airfryer like when I was doing the wall and then just like fell off and itself onto the kitchen floor from that high up and now my screen is kind of messed up a little bit and it's cracked on the side but still recording and as far as I know it's still okay so yeah anyway hope you guys enjoyed this video vlog and thank you for watching and I'll see you guys all in my next one or hopefully maybe I'll be painting this well the actual color it's gonna be maybe not I don't know we'll see but yeah bye guys you
