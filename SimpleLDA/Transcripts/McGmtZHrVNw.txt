  good morning guys welcome to another messy bun and another day in quarantine today it's Wednesday we're like halfway through the week it's been like a very kind of a boring week honestly but I decided to film like the second half of the week because we ordered a bunch of stuff for our apartment this is like actually giving us the first time ever to like sit down and decide what we want for our apartment we have like a lot of stuff coming in today tomorrow most what's coming in on Friday so we've like made a lot of adjustments so I figured it'd be fun to like film the second half the week when we're like hanging everything up and then maybe I'll do like an apartment tour I haven't done that yet so maybe this is the time grant and I are gonna do laundry this morning because we are in like much-need this is so gross but like pouring out of our hamper so we really need to do laundry today but grant wants to go at like 11:30 so that's in like 40 minutes so I think I'm going to meditate and then figure out what I'm gonna do for the rest of the day I want to film like a real time workout and I've been trying to do it but honestly what happened was I sure I've got like this timer effect that I could use in the videos but then I need to like update all my software and order for it to work in Final Cut Pro that's what I used to edit and then I found out that my computer can't like the software can't update to what it needs to be in order for the effect to work on Final Cut Pro so now I'm like that's like what I spent all yesterday doing was just updating my computer but now I kind of feel like I might need to get a new laptop cuz I've had this one since like my senior year of high school had it for like six years but I think it's time my computers like giving out at like 30 40 % it literally drops from like 30 or 40 percent somewhere around there all the way down to like 7% and then it dies shortly after sometimes the screen just goes black so I feel like since I'm on my computer so much it's time to just like get a new one either I buy it now when I'm not like going out to E and like don't have to pay for like a subway card any of that or I papered in like months when hopefully like everything's back to normal completely and then I'm gonna be like going out a lot of stuff so I feel like it's better if I just suck it up and do it now that's all the update so I'm gonna meditate really quickly and then figure out my day thank Google for the first time because we just got this shelf and had a sticker here and this stuff is like amazing like I can you see this just like what the heck oh my god now I just need to like clean it a little bit gee looks brand-spanking-new this is our new shelf and then we're gonna get rid of this desk it's all coming together Oh some homemade message to go to the laundromat you ready the bank it's the only time you are allowed to look like grants taking a quick nap so I think I'm actually going to film a like real time ab workout I was gonna wait to get that timer but then I realized to do like a core workout I don't really need the timer exciting just like    like a lot cuz in my brain I was like I want to get a bunch of different angles I ended up doing it like a million times but um watch that video when it comes out tried to work out a few onto and then let me know if you guys like that style of it or if you'd rather me like talking during it I think right now I'm gonna like voice over parts of it but that way if someone doesn't want to like listen to me talk and they're just like listen to music and watch the video then they can do that too I'm trying to give people options here but let me know in the comments what you guys would prefer and then yeah I'm just gonna try out stuff until we find something we all like isn't okay like I just did the full-on full-on workout right so a package was just delivered and grants taking a nap so I feel like he's been taken out for five hundred years but when he gets up we're gonna go get that and it's like um I'll show you guys when we get up it's like a curtain to cover up something I've just been like a very odd mood the last few days because I don't know it's very weird so I like wake up in the morning and I have a lot of energy and I like have a plan for the day or like at least like general things that I want to accomplish throughout the day and am I trying to keep myself busy and stuff and normally I'm like a very motivated and very disciplined person but for some reason right now when there's like so much free time I almost feel like I'm just not motivated so we've been like waking up and drinking coffee and like sometimes to do a workout today we don't workout but sometimes feel like that's a little door we're kind of psych after coffee after breakfast and everything and we've been like watching a movie in the morning which has been really nice it's like a very chill morning and I feel like very motivated to the rest today and then as soon as it hits like 1 o'clock 12 o'clock 1 o'clock somewhere around there I just get like I don't even know how to describe it cuz I've literally never had this happen before where I've felt this for like so many days in a row but I'll just have like a wave of like laziness and I'm just not feeling motivated and I don't really know what to do and so I'll just like lay in bed and do nothing so I did that today yeah I don't know like after we did laundry I literally just like lay dump on the bed and then I was like I don't want to get up like I just have no motivation to do anything and I feel like that's just kind of a product of the environment that we're in right now where it's just like there's nothing to do so everything kind of feels like why am I doing this there's nothing to do or like there's so much time summarized like I can do it's more like I've been trying to film this workout for like days that I just haven't felt very motivated to do it it's just like a weird time a very weird time to be just like be here and be doing with all this yeah so I just want to talk about that a little bit because I'm sure a lot of people are feeling that way and yeah it's just a very weird lonely time obviously I don't really know what the solution is because if I knew the solution then I'd be doing it and like they'll remove binnen yeah I like go through waves of feeling like motivated and like oh so much time to like focus on YouTube and to focus on like working out and to focus on me and waves of being like I just feel lost right now and a little bit 2 feet in and then I just kind of like flips back and forth between those two every day like 5 million times everyday you're feeling like that too you are not alone did we get it I think that's the spice rack oh my god is it that big all right will it fit under there yes I'll have to put it down yeah God they put these things in such big boxes it just didn't need all that look at this that's crazy and then finally I'm pretty sure that   setups just because like when you walked in out of the corner of your eye you would always see like a black jacket and our suitcase and stuff and I was just so distracting so I think that just makes it look a little bit more like you don't really notice it as much obviously the curtains not like perfect but I feel like that's a pretty good solution for right now I'll probably get up there again and fix all that so it looks really good but that's a good start the room is really coming together our whole apartment is we've switched up a lot of stuff in our kitchen we got a fruit basket and we hung this table we have now we have like a little coffee station we have a few more things coming for right here you guys saw we just got a spice rack so we can get everything up here the biggest plus side of this whole thing is just that now we finally have time to sit down and like actually like get stuff together for our apartment so it's nice it's really starting to feel like very homey even though we've lived here for like  I'm gonna turn the stove on right here just to help yeah the master my arms a little cold healthy copass she's already going just so according to okay okay this is good that we know that behind everything we've hung in this apartment there's probably like at least one wormhole behind oh yeah you know our interior design may not be the best but you would never know that there was other holes back there so it's working for us you know I think behind that one there's definitely a couple more holes this one there's a hole right there but right but you can't see it from here that's the thing you would know I don't think like listen I mean that late this entire time like I've only camp like 7:30 what happened to me I think our new coffee grinder gets here today I'm very excited about that we also have a blanket coming today because we bought new sheets but the rest of them aren't coming until Monday grant wants to buy Iraq to me Queens yes or breakfast everything bagel avocado chili lime seasoning and an egg on top and then we have some potatoes in the oven it is storming today we were gonna go for a run but yeah not not going for a run today I switched into leggings when I'm literally still in the shirt that I slept in um but I'm just gonna do really quickly my skincare for the morning I've been using the ordinary products and I really like them and it's like very very affordable so I kind of just bought them because I was no one cash but I actually really enjoyed them so that's like a caffeine serum that I put under my eyes and then this is the resveratrol and then I'm gonna put vitamin C on top of that and normally you're supposed to do that at night because it's like sensitive to the Sun but it does like dye our sheets to create now my solution is to do during the day since I'm at home not really in the Sun and then if I do go outside and I do it every other day but if I do go outside I just put on like a sunscreen I'm definitely not like a skin expert by any means it's a fine solution for the moment because I'm not going outside not in the Sun long term I might switch serum so I've been using a vitamin C serum for a year now on through a few different brands and honestly I like this one a lot um my other favorite brand is SkinCeuticals I was using their vitamin C serum and then I used a brand called topics and now I'm using this one and yeah I love the vitamin C serum it's like really helped clear up a lot of like acne scarring and like like discoloration and it's like even on my skin tone a lot might be time for a change because we just ordered like adult sheets like we spent money on buying sheets so I don't want to dye them orange it dies it like you know when you get when you do like like a tan at home and then if you sleep in your bed or wear something white you know how like stains it that's what it looks like on our sheets and it comes out if you wash it but yeah I just don't really want to deal with that anymore I just used this moisturizer we were using the kills one but we have ran out so and sort of like ordering out online we just pop this from Duane Reade or a Walgreens depending on where you live and they thought it target too but simple is a great brand I always post sunscreen even when I don't go outside I don't know why I love having like a dewy look and this way when I wear moisturizer and serums and all that I don't really have to wear makeup and then because I'm just sitting around a house I'm gonna put on the sleep mask but you're supposed to wear to bed and I do every night but sometimes I like wearing your tree in the day too now I get into the really fun task of doing my taxes a home improvement continues I'm so excited for this it's so pretty I think that's all on my dad house and the words of Sharpay it's out with the old and in with the new look so I want to yeah grant and I are in the middle of our workout and we just did my circuit so we don't really work out the same way so sometimes what we'll do what we're doing today is like aa program pro circuit and then heat programs for a circuit but I'm not excited for your circuits like all push-ups and planks so     while we were working out we were also making brownies because we're really good multitaskers not our best work but they're amazing they're so good dinner we're making whole-wheat pasta cutting up some vegetables and then we're gonna make some chicken guys my uncle sent me the cutest Easter basket I would take a picture of it like when it was all here but we have lots of candy oh we have one less piece of you know we've never dropped anything to the sides of these ever and now in this very vlog we've dropped a nail and a fun dip we're doing great  I was editing but then I got a notification that I could get an update and as I've said before I bought this thing and I can't do it because I don't have the update but I thought maybe this might work but now I have the loading the loading line of death which is no fun and it's taking forever but another example look at my screen another example of how I need a new computer I have the worst hiccups but it's happening it's updating I'm so excited that is such a relief I'm very excited I don't know why that wasn't working earlier but whatever we got it very exciting now I'm not really sure I guess I should put away these clothes oh my god the worst hiccups right now I'm gonna put away laundry while that is loading hiccups and I feel like such a child but I guess   pre-workout meal so this is literally just leftovers from dinner last night and then I'm going to let that sit for a second and then to a little workout for today make a dinner so I just made holy pasta with some veggies and then I made like an olive oil butter ease cheesy sauce sort of thing and then and then we have some chicken Wilson in there and of course a little drinky drink because it's Friday I hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm gonna end the vlog here if you did be sure to give it a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe and I will see you guys in
