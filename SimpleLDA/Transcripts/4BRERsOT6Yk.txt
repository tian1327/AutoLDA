hey there guys so i'm adding an extra intro into this video which is going to be a little different from what i would normally do because i honestly really debated i went back and forth on whether i should post this video right now or not period because of all the things that are much more important than this video that are going on in america specifically right now but also just in the world so i didn't want to just post this video of me sharing my to-do list and like talking to my kids and tie-dying and whatever without first recognizing that like i'm able to do these things right now because i have privilege i had originally planned on filming on saturday and ended up deciding that i really needed to spend the day doing a lot of listening a lot of reflecting a lot of praying and a lot of just identifying my privilege and being uncomfortable and being willing to talk about it i had some conversations both in my personal life and on social media specifically mostly on my instagram but also on facebook where i just felt like i needed to use my voice and stand up for what is right i teach my kids to be upstanders versus bystanders you don't stand by and let somebody say something to your friend or hurt somebody and you would never stand by and like watch somebody do that not say anything and i feel like if i'm teaching my kids to do that on the playground like i need to be doing that in my own life as well and i feel like by being quiet for so long online i have been complacent and i have been a bystander to this and i have hid behind my privilege for a long time and that's something that i'm working on i'm not perfect and i'm not going to claim to have all the answers because i just don't but i am feeling very motivated right now to learn from others and to do better and to be better because we need to we need to there's no other option it is quite literally life or death at this point so i did ultimately decide that i still want to upload this vlog attaching this intro onto it and i'm going to take out my normal description that i have below usually i link like my amazon wishlist my amazon storefront and like you know affiliate codes and stuff like that i'm going to take all that out and instead i'm going to put some links to different resources that i have found helpful over the past several days or even before that so i'm going to link some channels some books just a bunch of different things that i have really felt have helped me on this journey of trying to be an ally i still want to share this video with you guys but i want to let you know like if i'm happy or silly or whatever crazy like i always am in this video it's not because i don't care it's just because like you aren't seeing the work done on camera if that makes sense like i wasn't filming it because i don't want attention for it like that's not the point so anyways we're going to jump into this video and then i will talk to you guys again at the end for a little bit of an outro so thank you guys for joining me today i hope that you have stuck with me through this intro and let's go ahead and get into the video hey there guys welcome to a new video if you are new here my name is kim i'm a second year fourth grade teacher in west michigan and today is a busy day it already has been a busy day it's right before noon right now and i already have gotten a lot done and i'm actually tracking my to-do list a little bit differently today so i showed me making this last night this is going to be linked in the description box just as a freebie for fun but i also thought i would show you guys how i made it in case you're interested in kind of tweaking it and making your own so i use powerpoint to make pretty much everything and i've learned how to use powerpoint from just watching a ton of youtube videos and i'm still honestly not great at it but i try and then i use these thermal laminating pages that i just get off of amazon and my little scotch laminator you can see i have an amazon one in the background too but i like the scotch one better and then once it was all laminated then i used different color sticky notes and just stuck those on with all of my daily to-do's [Music] basically i just needed to try something new to keep me excited to keep me inspired i've been using just like either google keep or be just no app on my phone and i wanted something that i could touch so i made this last night i basically just made it in powerpoint and i'll link it as a freebie below if you want it so the things that are pink over here are my must-dos these are the things that i want to do but like they're medium priority and then the things over here are very low priority i don't really have to do them but i would like to do them and then at the bottom i can move my sticky notes once i do them and then i put your hashtag goals because that's something i like to say just as like a joke so today i already finished some of my must-dos i already did my google meet i got ready i emailed my students parents about our last week of school plans because next week is our last week of school and i had another google meeting but it must have fallen off when i did my first one yep they were stuck together so i had two google meetings so now these are the things i still need to get done today i'm meeting with my kids today i need to email some paperwork to hr which i've been working on i should put paint my nails in there because i need to paint my nails too they're looking pretty rough but yeah so i will let you guys know throughout the day how this goes but i am excited about it i'm the type of person who likes to switch things up to keep myself excited and interested and wanting to do stuff and so so far so good today i am liking this okay so i have this pasta in this container that i'm just gonna heat up for lunch so this is what i'm gonna heat up really quick for lunch this was just a tortellini from trader joe's that i made last night for dinner so now it's today's lunch hey there guys so i'm just about to hop on a google meet with my kids and it's actually our last friday google meet usually have meetings on wednesdays and fridays and our very last meeting is going to be this upcoming wednesday but for today i wanted to do something fun so we will be baking together again today have this whole fun set up over here using clorox wipes as a nice little standing desk and some of my kids watch my channel and so i thought it would be really funny if we make these s'mores brownies that i tried to make in a recent youtube video but we make them the right way so fingers crossed that it goes well but i'm just about to hop on that with my kids and then i will talk to you guys after hello [Music] oh you were talking to your sister and you guys were getting along very well right [Music] if you guys hear any noise in the background mr halls is actually home today and he's working on our deck so he's banging around out there so you might hear that in the background [Music] all right let's vote red or blue one finger for red two fingers for blue [Music] i told you guys in our last meeting that i made some brownies but i burnt them so today i'm gonna try to make the brownies again but i'm gonna try not to burn them so that's the goal so you guys need to help me out okay so i need to work on adding some of those other ingredients does anybody have a guess what else i'm going to need to put into this [Music] i think we're good to stir this up now i have my three tablespoons of water my two eggs and my half cup of vegetable oil [Music] says to put them in for about 20 minutes so we'll try that first and then see how they look okay so we're gonna wrap it up for today but i will plan on seeing you guys next week we're gonna do lunch bunch on monday and then we're gonna do our final meeting on wednesday already have a good weekend stay safe play outside and i will see you guys then love you guys bye hey guys so i just finished up my meeting with my kids it was so fun i did manage to get brownie batter on my shirt because of who i am as a person i like lean forward right onto the bowl but i wanted to show you guys i use this little like clamp thing it's like a little clamp tripod i saw this on meleen's instagram but i don't have the exact one that she has and i think she probably has a better one than i do because mine is not great but that's okay it worked for this purpose and that way i could show the bowl and like the pan and stuff while i was baking so that was super fun i did realize though brownies take a lot longer to cook than cookies and so we didn't get a chance to finish them together so i still have to do the marshmallow part all by myself and hopefully not mess it up so i'm not gonna go outside this time to broil also i learned apparently you're supposed to crack the oven while you broil who knew [Music] hello friends so i did it and i didn't burn the marshmallows and i still have brownie batter on my shirt so maybe we should change that but i was talking to one of my co-workers on the phone while i was making these so that's why if you saw my phone up to my ear in the clip i used the broiler on low and i left it open because that's what you guys told me to do and i only left it in for like a few minutes and it looks so good i honestly don't even know if the brownies are done all the way though so hopefully they are oh they're smooshy i feel like this doesn't really work like the brownies were done before i added the marshmallows and broiled it i promise so if i stir it maybe i can make like a really good s'mores dip and then i can put it on a graham cracker and that could be good so we'll just do that okay you guys i feel like the lighting's probably really bad but that's okay we're gonna work with it i'm just dipping a graham cracker into this like that and we're gonna see how it tastes oh my gosh it's so good so now i need to finish cleaning this up and then i still have some paperwork i need to get done today like need to get done because it's due on monday so i want to get it done today in case i mess it up and then morgan and chelsea and i are gonna have our weekly meeting at 2 30 which is in like 20 minutes hey guys so i just changed my shirt because you know brownie batter but i want to show you guys my little to-do list and how it's going so i only have one more have to do to do it on there and then these are my want to do's and my could do's and then this is what i've already finished so i just have them stacked on top of each other hey there guys so i'm just about to jump on my call with chelsea and morgan you can probably hear chris washing the deck so just ignore that that's fine so i decided i'm going to add a few things to my to-do list because i feel like throughout the day i always think of more stuff i need to do so i'm going to add a couple low priority things also tell me if you guys do this too sometimes i add things to my list as i go that i know are going to be easy for me to do so that way i can feel accomplished so i'm facetiming with morgan and chelsea here they are and morgan hold on i have to turn my volume back up morgan what are you showing us right now this is my bow dresser it's kind of messy because i just dig through it which i do have flora but they're like not in here and then i get all small dojo bows by color oh my god and then these are miscellaneous bubbles that's the size of my actual dresser for my clothes oh my gosh [Music] hey there guys so now it is sunday it is may 31 and i have been kind of in a weird headspace yesterday and today i did get done pretty much all of my to-do's and i kept adding more stuff on here the only thing i still haven't done is cut up my fruit and veggies so i'll have to do that sometime today but i for the last 24 hours probably have been taking in a lot more media than i normally do i normally don't really sit on my phone that long like sometimes i'll sit and like post an instagram story and like just check out you know the first few pictures i see on instagram but i don't usually spend more than like 10 or 15 minutes on at a time if that makes sense right now i have been doing a lot more consuming of posts and some of it has been really really good and just things that like i need to learn and i need to do better and some of it has been really really bad megan forbes from too cool for middle school she is one of my favorite people to follow and she always has been and she shared a video within like the last couple weeks i think where she shared 10 books that every white person should read and i found that video to be very helpful some of them i had already read some of them are on my tbr list and some of them i had never heard of before and i i've talked to you guys in previous vlogs about how i am doing a book study with a bunch of other teachers and that has been very eye-opening as well but i think i'm just realizing like i really need to do better and i need to work harder at this because you can't be passively anti-racist and i think for a long time that's what i thought i was being was anti-racist but i wasn't showing it in all capacities of my life and so anyways just all that to say i need to do better and i'm working to do better and learn more but that's been a lot of what i've been doing the past 24 hours is doing a lot of reading and researching and watching videos and whatever but now i decided i'm just going to take a little break from my phone for now i died i say that but i like just posted on it a little bit ago but i'm going to try to take a little break my best friend melissa is actually coming over later we're going to stay outside and not be like right up by each other but she is coming over and i got her a little end of the school year gift so i got us these t-shirts i found these on etsy i'll link the store below they are like this really soft bella canvas brand and i got her a pink one that just has the shape of michigan and then teacher and cursive in the middle and then i got myself a yellow one because you guys know i love the color yellow and these are super soft and they're just gonna be really cozy and i thought they would make for a really cute picture so i got her that and then i also grabbed her some little mini erasers last time i was at the target dollar spot and i feel like there was something else i got her but i'm not seeing it by me so i'll just say that this is it for now but i'm just gonna like get some string and tie it up all cute and give that to her when she comes over so hopefully she likes that and when she comes over we are going to be tie-dying so i actually found a tie-dye kit i had bought some just like individual bottles that i showed you guys in a recent video but then i saw this and had to pick it up it was the last one and i figured this will probably last for a little while i mean actually i don't know can you save the dye i don't really know how that works but hopefully we will get to use at least some of these and that will be fun and then i picked melissa up a shirt and then i have a couple shirts in the wash right now so that will be fun and then also i went to the dollar store yesterday because i was finishing up picking up some things for my kids end-of-year gifts and i found this really cute book it's just like a hardcover cool down book a book about working through anger and i thought this was really cute and would be perfect for my cool down bucket and then also i picked up just like a nice hardcover i think this is probably a young adult book yeah on the back it says young adult but i just picked up a book because i really enjoy having like actual hard books and i've gotten more used to reading on my ipad but it's still not my favorite thing and then i got a book in the mail which this is one i have been wanting for a long time so i'm super excited to have this and this actually was purchased for me off of my amazon wishlist from brooke so brooke thank you so much her message said hi kim my fourth graders loved this book and i can't wait to use it in first grade as i'm moving there this year it was fun to have my kiddos write a point of view piece with them being the balloon in the parade i hope you love it from brooke so brooke thank you so much i am definitely super excited to add this to my book collection and then i'm kind of going out of order but i picked these up at dollar tree i thought those were super cute in the mail yesterday i got a new base coat that came this is just the orally bonder base coat i've been using this since high school and i love it it's like the best base coat i've ever tried and then i also picked up just some rubber bands for our tie-dying so all sorts of fun stuff oh and i um we got a salad spinner for our wedding but i cannot find it for the life of me so i picked up just like a really cheap salad spinner yesterday too so i'm excited to have this in my life and that's kind of why i was holding off to do the fruit and veggies because i just thought it would be so much better if i had a salad spinner so now i do so now i'm gonna work on getting all this stuff cleaned up and then i'm going to work on getting melissa's cute little gift all put together so like i said i'll probably just like roll this up and then maybe i probably have a bag downstairs in the storage room that i could use and then i'll just put these inside so that's the game plan let's clean this up first and then we can go do that okay so i have melissa's shirt and then i found this little bag downstairs usually we keep just like some extra bags so i have this all set up in here for her when she gets here in just a minute and then i have a few t-shirts because i've been wanting to tie-dye for a while so i kind of just collected them this top one is actually the same brand of shirt that i'm wearing right now you can get these in the men's section at target for six dollars and they're super soft so i actually have a few of these at this point i just like getting them like oversized and wearing them with leggings and then i have just like a basic gildan brand one and then i also ordered this champion long sleeve one off of amazon so i have three of those i'm gonna try to do them like different colors and design so we'll see it's been a long time since i tie-dyed so we'll see how those turn out and then here is the tie-dying stuff so i have the big pack and then i have three of these individual bottles and then i have a bunch of rubber bands and i found these at the dollar store when i went yesterday i don't really know if i would need them for anything but i just grabbed them just in case and then there's gloves in that pack but we also have some too if we need them so we are just about good to go and i think melissa's gonna be here in just a little bit so yay all right end of year again wow so nice okay this is the cat room from the outside oh i like that oh this looks cute sure michigan teacher hey [Music] it's okay i didn't know yeah like maybe she's hiding the yellow shirt yeah who knows it's so cute though isn't that fun i gotta have an etsy it's happening wow there are two of them in there somewhere they're summer ones oh cute yeah cake so melissa has tie-dyed a lot in her day and she was just teaching me how so melissa can you please give one more quick tutorial yes so you're either going to want your shirt damp or dry depending on what you want if it's damp it'll be like less white on your shirt and if it's dry you'll probably get more white no guarantees obviously and then i like to lay it out flat okay and then i'm doing the spiral tie day so what i do is i always reach for like a bottom corner and that's where the center of my spiral is going to be and then you just kind of grab like a little bit and you just twist and twist and then kind of like tuck in the edges as you go so that you get a nice little sponge [Music] keep going and it doesn't have to be perfect so you wrap it into like a little roll and then what you'll do is put three rubber bands so one here one here and one here like a little snowflake amazing the queen of tie-dye i'm so excited hey guys thank you for watching all the way until the end of the video i hope that you guys enjoyed this and i hope that you are learning more right now and you're doing the work and doing the research and if not i hope that my introduction maybe strikes a chord and knowing that there's maybe more you can do than what you're doing right now and i don't know you all obviously who are watching this but i do know myself and i know that i've seen stuff like this happen before and i know that i thought in my heart like it's so wrong i can't believe this is happening but i haven't said anything about it and i haven't spoken up and i'm learning a lot and i just want to reiterate like don't let being scared of saying things incorrectly or imperfectly keep you from saying anything at all because we we all have a voice and especially as teachers like we are all influencers which whether you have a youtube channel or an instagram page or not like you are an influence influencer you're influencing somebody you have family and friends and if you're a teacher you have students and i do think it's our moral and civic obligation to speak up when things are wrong and right now there's a lot of wrong going on and so anyways i'm not perfect i don't have all the answers and i'm i'm just now learning and so i definitely want to point you in the right direction of some people who have really put in the work and done the research and shared you know their truths and so i'm gonna be linking a bunch of people and articles and books in the description box just some things that i think would be a good place to get started but like i said like there's so many people who are more educated on this than i am like i'm just one person so please please please check out some of those links below and um just start doing that work because i think it's so important thank you so much for watching this video i really hope that you guys enjoyed it and i will see you guys next time bye guys [Music] you
