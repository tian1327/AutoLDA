 alright hey everybody it's my first vlog I don't know what's going on my voice it's still pretty early but I am going on my six-week postpartum visit if OBGYNs office today and I am excited not really for the visit I can't wait for it to be over but um I'm excited for her to just say like everything is good and I can start working out again I have not worked out since probably my last week of pregnancy and yeah I worked out pretty much throughout my whole pregnancy light stuff for the most part for the most part but I'm ready to start getting into things I am very very very happy with my shape to be honest I'm surprised I wouldn't have been surprised if I blew up but I don't really feel like I did it all um and I'm not afraid of a little belly anyway um I will try and show you guys what I look like six weeks postpartum but the funny thing is I actually definitely ate burger fries and ice cream yesterday which I don't do every day but every once in a while when I have craving you know you gotta fulfill it so I was kind of bloated this morning and still kind of am and when I got on the scale I was actually three pounds heavier but I'm really not worried about it cuz it all pass out drinking water and eventually I'll be working out so join me on this journey alright y'all this is my six week post partum shape I am just trying to be transparent so you're gonna see all the angles and everything I don't know what y'all think but I am very very happy with my shape I don't quite have a six-pack per se but I definitely got that back alright let me stop but honestly I hoped and prayed for the snapback but wasn't really sure what actually happened so here we are pleasantly surprised and I want you all to know that if I can do it you can do it too Wow so I just looked at the time and at 6:55 a.m. till 7 a.m. I didn't realize I woke up so early but you know having a baby week of all times of the day so yeah I still have like two and a half three hours until I need to leave for my doctor's visit which is good because I'm about ready to eat again and I'm kind of really gonna eat twice before we go and we'll need to feed my daughter in Yolo ah yeah right now she's hanging out my dad's my dad she's hanging out with her dad my husband and she's sleeping I'll try and give you guys a sneak peek where are they are daddy a ninny hola babe daddy in your luau say hi all right let's go all right John in the car we are headed to this postpartum visit the way I'm feeling right now is again I just can't wait for it to be done because I don't really like going to the doctors during cool the 19 before Cova 19 I didn't really care that much but now you know I just don't like going to the doctor's office because I feel like 66 people go there um so hopefully I'm just in and out I'm just waiting for her to really clear me and I cannot wait to work out I'll probably work out as early as tomorrow and if I'm feeling really up to it tonight but I'm just gonna do something small you know starting out with like sit-ups push-ups and stretches stuff like that so we will see   alright y'all I got my mask on and I'm in my patient room at the doctor's office it was so funny on the drive here I saw so many people I mean like no one was wearing masks it was very weird and there's so many many more cars on the road now than there were before I joined this whole quarantine I still had like mandatory doctor's visit you know being pregnant I'm giving birth and you know having a pediatrician business also for my daughter so you know I noticed it being kind of barren yeah I was happy about that but there are a lot of people on the road so I guess and it's in phase one reopening and got sent something along the lines up how no one was wearing masks and there are so many more cars out on the road now then even before when I used to be on visits and I just can't wait to get home to be honest I don't know how everybody else feels but I just feel safer there Brian those walls and I thought people out here wild what no masks but at least in the doctor's office like everybody's wearing a mask I think people are smart enough to do that oh by the way this is all my opinion so if you're one of those people that doesn't wear a mask no judgment just uh I'm gonna keep my distance oh yeah it was crazy actually driving because I haven't driven myself like in a really really long time because first of all we haven't been going places that much and then second of all at the end of pregnancy I wasn't driving since my husband was driving and so it's kind of just crazy to be on the road again it's kind of fun it's nice to be on the road I like driving somewhat like I like that at the beginning and then I remember how crazy Louisiana drivers are and I was like yo get me back home oh this visit this is the first doctor's visit that my husband husband has not been on since all this pregnancy was Birnam and everything I mean towards the end of pregnancy they weren't allowing him in but he at least drove me and was in the car the whole time but now it was just me all by my lonesome cuz um it just made more sense now that we have a daughter it's just a lot more work I don't see trouble but it's just more work to travel places and so they're home together I also am gonna create another video later that just talks about how I was able to stay in such good shape throughout pregnancy and also postpartum and I also even talked to you about how I was able to do not have any stretch marks so stay tuned for that and if that is something you would like to see can you just comment below and letting me know so that I know that's content you want alright so I will let you know what the doctor says after this visit how I feel hey we're all done so all done the visit doctor says everything is good and I'm happy I'm good to go everything went smoothly I'm healthy blah blah it's not a few someone's coming I think someone is coming
