 what's up guys today our resident extrovert Chris and our resident introvert me I've come up with some questions for each other that will hopefully shed some light on our key differences during this time and help us all understand each other a little bit better maybe just to give everyone a little bit of a background how did we come to terms with step you are they the in-house introvert and me the in-house extra bite right so here's all the context that you need chris is in denial about his extraversion I am well but I of I am secure my introversion I don't know how deep I want to go first I shall oh whatever let's go deep let's go deep look good deed first ready do you feel like you're introverted friends have abandoned you well wow that's really the short answer is yes the long answer is just before this everything happened I went out a lot but I went out like an average like two or three times a week and going from that to like not see anyone at all was a huge adjustment that I had to make I went through my whole journey of you know the five stages of grief or like an extrovert you know like denial big super mad and like myself being mad you know the fact that feeling my friends at the bend me and then eventually lead towards this period of just complete Zen and some where I am where the situation is as you guys saw Chris has some sort of complex about whether or not he's an extrovert and I wanted to ask you if this experience has shed any light on whether or not you're an extrovert oh okay so this might be that the best question you can ask me about extraversion personally because I always joke with you and our friend in science you know I want to be an introvert I am an introvert but I think I've come to really into so guys this is me admitting on camera but I am I think I am an extrovert you know you gotta be honest with yourself right I think the best thing about our friendship is that because it never gets boring like I always expect that I'm learning something new about you you know every year every day right and that's that's the beauty of it so you answered the question I just wanted you to stay flat out god I am an extrovert how would you say your quality of life has changed since quarantine I think it's been a lot better than pretty because I was working on atomic projects I was putting together a lot of social events I was going out you know I was busy with my daytime job I started to feel like I was stretching myself a little thing so now I've been able to kind of use this time to recuperate and recharge my energy I've been able to just leave so many things that I've been you know I've been having a backlog for I just pour all the energy that I have in reserve towards that and it's charged in every single way imaginable so the quality of life for me has been always that question was supposed to direct you into being like oh man my my quality of quality of life sucks I'm an extroverted a and all my friends have ditched me but you answered it honestly and you were like no I'm actually like this is how I choose to look at the situation this experience is kind of what you make of it you know last question is do you have any other advice for extroverts out there a lot of the troubles I think that I have as an extrovert like loneliness you feeling abandoned right you you were talking about earlier I think that comes a lot from from me thinking about myself and being a little selfish like oh me me me me me me me me right but then when I start to like sit down and think wait this world that I live it isn't just about me there's so many people that surround me right how can I help them when I when I start to think about that that helps me so much like in fact I don't think I even have time to think about the fact that I'm extroverted and I have no friends but I can't see my friends right now like those things like you push them down into such a lower priority list and you start to be able to like think about things that are much bigger in scale and now most we allow to my biggest advice to extroverts I think is to not take it personally when you're introvert friends aren't taking some space we haven't forgotten about you we still care about you but also to reach out to your other extroverted friends don't be afraid to ask for what you need especially from other extroverted people who are looking for the exact same thing as you are like true extrovert  please drop a comment tell us what's been happening everyone who's watching this video and please give us some comments you know both the introverts and experts I'm so curious on how you're looking at the situation these days and don't forget to Like and subscribe this traffic making that time to like reconnect old flames of friendships and you know like taking the time to call
