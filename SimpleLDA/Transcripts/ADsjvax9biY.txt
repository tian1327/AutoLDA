 my life is madness right now apparently I'm moving tomorrow morning and I have not packed anything I'm completely unprepared to move and now it's Saturday in New York City during the whole quarantine and I am about to run to Home Depot to pick up any sort of moving supplies that I can get my hands on but yeah that's what's happening right now and I need to basically spend the day packing now I did a lot in the last two hours this is what the current situation looks like I'm like too lazy to even get up the kitchen you can't really see but it's a mess all right guys it is moving day and pretty much good to go but I have a lot of actually little things to just throw into bags at this point so I'm gonna do that because I don't have much time left this is  I just got to the new apartment waiting for my movers and I'll give you guys a little tour so this is a brand new unit kitchen I am obsessed dishwasher storage here we have the fridge nice coat closet where they can just put a bunch of things this is John's room master bath this is my room this is a communal bathroom but it's technically mines and Shawn has his own I actually really need to get a tension rod in order to shower today and this is the best part of the apartment y'all super excited they had low - my blog I was just explaining how happy and how I can't stop smiling because of this laundry it's been so long since I had laundry oh my gosh I am Michelle I do talk like this all the time like this closer for the first time in like four years  closet not organized but all the way things up I don't have a bed frame excuse that but it's just on the floor setup there's still a huge mess it's really all just about organizing my clothes so I am really not in the mood to do that but I will probably do that tomorrow or a little by little throughout the week but yeah  everybody this is eventually the first morning in my new apartment there's a lot of clutter happening but we're still like trying to figure out a home for every item we did set up the TV kind of so we watched an episode of Ito on classic stray I also have somebody from spectrum coming to install Wi-Fi at the apartment it's been like cooped up in this apartment or not even just this apartment I've just been cooped up indoors without getting any sort of physical activity and I'm really really feeling the effects so I'm going to explore the gym downstairs it's a tiny gym but obviously like still super grateful for it because we have a gym in the building right now they're not allowing more than four people at once so hopefully no one is there so I can get like a quick run and because I feel like crap so out of shape it's not even funny but one day at a time we're gonna get back there honestly lost cow of the days and how many days it's been since people generally started working from home so far my daily routine has been pretty much the same and I don't really get ready generally but today I was like you know what I feel better when I do get somewhat ready so I just literally put like two products on my face    Oh see my little setup right here so that pretty much wraps up this vlog I know I haven't posted in two months which is a really long time and you know going back into YouTube I made it a goal for myself to upload something at least once a week but as some of you guys know my latest video was kind of me feeling like I've been in a rut so I'm still kind of I'm much better than I was in that video to be honest but I'm still working on finding my way I'm realizing it's not really depression and I think I misspoke by saying high functioning depression but I only labeled it asked that because that's all that I could define it as in that moment but after obviously two months have passed and I've done some self-reflection I'm realizing it's really just me going through the typical quarter life crisis not feeling completely satisfied with the direction I'm heading in and also just feeling confused which is completely normal and I'm so grateful to be where I'm at but yeah I think we're all just figuring it out together and it's kind of just one step at a time but yeah I am much better I mean a much better mental state I think this move also really helps me a lot it gave me a little bit of momentum in life and I do feel a lot happier in this apartment already so here's to coronavirus and figuring it out together
