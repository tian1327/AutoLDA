  good morning guys so we just got to the post office and i figured i'd go ahead and just kind of vlog today uh this is gonna be more of like a reseller themed vlog which i actually haven't done yet on my channel but i'm starting to transition more into business and reselling type videos but like i said we're about to ship some packages they're all in the back seat here usually only one of us goes in the post office just to be kind of extra careful since we have to still wear like a mask and gloves and usually it's me yeah usually it's spencer thankfully he does it for me i'm very spoiled but after that we're gonna go pick up our coffee at starbucks i just placed an order with the app and then we're actually gonna meet a client to do a buy hopefully we get a couple really good things kind of counting on that um and then i think we're going to do a little photo shoot for the business instagram which if you guys want to follow it it's brookish bargains so i figured i'd go ahead and bring you guys along and i hope you guys enjoy this vlog gearing up going to battle so real quick i'll go ahead and show you guys our order spencer always gets the caramel cloud macchiato with an extra shot of espresso one less pump of vanilla syrup and almond milk and this isn't what i usually get but i figured i'd go ahead and show it anyways um i'm gonna try this coffee frappuccino which i actually don't think i've ever had before and i got almond milk whipped cream and caramel drizzle so let's give it a try oh also you guys just look at my new phone case it's my puppy she's so cute  so spencer just went in to pick up the coffee at starbucks um i have to show you guys these glasses i ordered off amazon i think they're so fun and cute they were only like ten dollars so i'll go ahead and have them linked down below if you guys want to pick them up but i think they'll be so fun for like photo shoots i forgot to bring a hair clip i actually bought these cute little like claw clips i've seen those are really in style i feel like these are just so vogue and they're just like fun little crazy sunglasses i don't know how much i'll actually wear them i feel like they're mostly just for like pictures and photo shoots but i just want to show you guys all right so the boys back with the drinks this looks so good i'm so excited to try it oh my god okay you guys have to try this honestly like 10 out of 10. try it it's like sugar overload it's so good it was the same amount of calories as yours really that's amazing all right so spencer just got back in the car after meeting with our client um we ended up getting two things so we ended up picking up this cute little burberry bag it's nova check and it has the leather straps just a nice very obvious burberry bag they're really known for the nova checks and if you guys ever get anything burberry if it does have that nova check pattern on it it always sells for a little bit more um and then this is probably the better thing that we got so this is a louis vuitton wallet uh do you know the exact style name i don't it's uh i don't i didn't know it when i looked it up but i forgot now but it's quilted yeah it's like a quilted little wallet here it has a little turn thing and it's pretty good condition obviously we're going to clean it up a little bit um but really excited to put this for sale on our store if you guys want to check it out go ahead and it'll be in the description box down below but it's just www.com i didn't need to say that it's brokefishbargains.com okay so we just got to where we're going to try and take pictures um we haven't really found the perfect location yet our theme is mostly just like beiges and more neutral tones so we're trying to find that but it's also kind of like a city theme okay so we just took a picture out here outside of max mara i'm wearing this really cute versus uh versace dress and i also had on these gucci boots which are amazing and of course the sunglasses i just showed you guys sorry the lighting is like so bad um i forgot to vlog it but i'll go ahead and like show you guys the pictures or whatever you can see them on my instagram now i'm back in my comfy nike socks and little slides so my next outfit change is these christian dior nude heels the burberry bag we just got my nike shorts an ariana grande   t-shirt  so we just got back to the house and we've kind of just been like chilling by the pool and relaxing honestly i don't know that we're gonna get too much work done we might list a couple things later and spencer might edit some pictures but i think i'm gonna go ahead and end the vlog here so i hope that you guys like this little vlog and it gave you an insight as to what it's like as a day in my life as a reseller if
