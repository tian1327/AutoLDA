 science how's everything so far  morning guys this is William my first block never done it so I might as well in point in time I'll start to do it anyway this video we want to show you normal life as a parents who have two kids for being in a garden hopefully this video can somehow show of the parents around the world that we also struggling wanna give you some tips and tricks that we found me and my wife found very helpful and smoking I guess number one is the scheduling our kids normally when they woke up on school day they woke up very early 7:30 sometimes 7:45 and ridiculous coco 838 Australis that's the time they started school but since discipline Democratic 19 happens in New York so I regret to have to announce that as of tomorrow our public schools will be closed students are now comfortably or you can quality more online or online school we normally like to start everything sharp at 8:30 because I believe that you you really start everything early that you will in this totally and some they do have more work that you need to do if we messed up with the scheduling kids sometimes can finish their work at nighttime so we try to avoid that and it's just not making sense for kids to have such a long hours to finish their work  so it's 8 around 8:15 today that keeps us awake so I'll give you up today what do you have and you have a meaning - I believe so today is very packed you have a lot of things to do it's already 8:30 are we gonna start everything on time I have first thing what do you have to do this is the attendance how does New York state school do the attendance so how do they do it so always the question  so give your is for free I guess every morning you always do math first keg winnings I am so Diane is about to start his online school remote online and Zion has his iPad to do his school okay normally Zion when he does his online school mommy help he L is your math Dan come do it I guess one of the struggle of taking care of the kids at school is to help them to focus as you can see Gabriel stop start to shine out as we are trying to help them to do descendants so you just have to be a constant reminder it all just move forward once in a while I like to go back inside this check on them and see how they're doing and make sure everything is done on time so how's everything so the kids are doing their work we like to leave them alone when they're doing the work because that technically they have to figure out the answers and they have to do it themselves so as we are waiting if I went back upstairs to do my work and my wife is preparing the part first okay so call me when you're done how much how many more question do you have to do okay go ahead  science how's everything so far when I said to our friends here he is the best cook give you up yeah dude that we can man yeah GK  I guess what do you have to do next after you answer all this questions turn ad coming in so that's how you teach your nose that you die on I get done with your work okay until you over please coax to deal of this come on come on come on I want to tell a little bit about this iPad here since we have one computer for kids for one cookie you have to do is work and one for me to do my work so we like in one more device was I am to do his own line motor and nice things about New York City's the Department of Education that they provide I Pat fall but also dinosaurs so we will quest one iPad and we figure this will actually help design to do his assignments better because that way Gabriel's I'm doesn't have to take turns to do their work and they can finish everything on time we don't have I pass away request one and it's been a helpful so thank you New York yes let's get distracted again you can work that's a struggle  Eric Dolphy versus food makers big astrology and please make this food bill to help them easily  honey he's like 20 minutes don't don't laugh at your end okay can you eat that first fast okay don't be happy when your and in the Fox happy so Gabe is having a meeting with his teacher at school yes is that what you're doing right now as kpi's doing his meeting is meeting his teachers in science continuing his work  what recess this is recess okay yay okay  what's the year living English Language Arts is there your favorite subject I guess number one struggle is is ela but we normally do is we let give you to the year like himself come check his work kiba pizza la yep so that's the day that we normally went through with our kids as they are doing the online school can be really tough at one point but there are days are very easy like today is considered to be very nice one as you can see that they are walking hard so I guess they the the main tips that I can maybe share with everyone is just a scheduling you know it's scheduling they have to finish their work on time you know I do set a time for given I am to have a walk done this can truly help them to focus as well as a parents do make our time more available for them and to help them you know because they tends to get distracted they want to play they want to eat them you know they keep finding excuses to do other things bathroom doing waters playing and their siblings they like to party each other so our presence here their parents is to help them to focus you know we have to keep reminding them so I guess number one is the scheduling I know it's tough but you guys can do it number two is we just got to be tough at them so that's onion he finished his uh in the garden work yes the easy things right also finish used to steep scheduling I know there's a lot of commitments but you guys can do it and don't give up guys top discovers nineteen satin Deming become very soul see you the next one
