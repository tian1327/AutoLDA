 so I just wanted to send everybody a message and recap just let you know how I'm doing I just want to thank you all for the kind words and messages that I got on Facebook and comments and private texts and cards and phone calls I mean there's no way I could thank each of you personally and I just want to thank you it really meant a lot to me and it I know it really helped me mentally and emotionally and uh in my recovery so I'm so I'm so grateful for it for you and and for all the kind words that were that were said so just to make recap for you I believe I was exposed on the 13th I developed symptoms on the 20th I was swab done the 21st I was sick from March 28th to the 29th I had an ER visit on the 27th where I thought it was dying on on the morning the 29th I no longer had a fever so I sort of say that that was the day that I no longer well I was still debilitated but I was hopeful on the path to recovery and then on March 3rd I got my nasal swab results actually when I got up in the morning I saw I missed a phone call at 1:00 a.m. from a lab although they didn't leave their phone number so my doctor's office called me that morning to tell me that my nasal swab result was positive for kovat 19 and then soon after that so anyway that was thirteen days after I was swapped that is like extraordinarily long I believe I mean there was a big problem with that with you know test results like that lagging so far behind I mean the data can hardly be good when it's when it's that slow I dunno recently I know I've had people that have had test results back within three days so that's obviously a lot better so I don't know what happened with mine but anyway they called my my doctor's office you called the on-call in the middle of the night when it resulted and so they called me to let me know so then of course I was a positive case that the health department called me had all kinds of questions for me also asked about all that old dog Sophie who was with me the whole time you know when I was in bed sleeping or in the chair she was with me the whole time but she spent fine and Jeff's been fine I mean he had like a head cold and body aches the whole time I was ill but he never had anything else so honey never you know got tested or anything so we'll never know whether he had it so just I'm I'm doing a lot better every day I'm just trying to regain my strength I mean it was really amazing how debilitating those nine days of illness were because I'm normally a really active person I walk a lot I exercise so a few days ago I started walking two times a day because even walking a half mile was wearing me out and so I'm now I'm walking twice a day yesterday even mode our yard even though it's it's little and this morning I picked up sticks in the yard because we had a bad storm so I'm trying to do some extra things I mean I'm cooking I'm cleaning so those are all good I'm still sleeping like nine to ten hours a night and I take in a one and a half to two hour and half a day so I'm hoping I'll be ready to go back to work when when the time comes but I am proof that you can you can get through and you can get better and I and I'm getting better every day so I'm really thankful for that because I know there are plenty of people that didn't make it so I just had thought of something I wanted to add I've had some really positive things come out of Cove in 19 for me I've reconnected with some family members that I hadn't talked to in forever you not that there was any problem it's just you know he sort of just lost touch and drifted away and it's been really neat to reconnect you know I reconnect knit with ant that I hadn't seen in a long time and last year and then my cousin and you know and I've talked to both of them the last couple weeks talked to some old neighbors that moved away gotten cards from people that live far away from me and so it's been really neat that just the connections that I've made because I've been sick we have done like a family zoom call on both sides of Jeff's and mine and we have another one planned coming up I mean this is something we haven't ever done and like I don't know why and I think so this will really we're gonna look at good things I mean this is a really good thing I think that's coming out of all this making us stay home you know families might you know after spending time together you may not want to go back to what was normal you know you may not want to go back to having ballet and Taekwondo and swimming lessons and and you know being so busy and not having time to have dinner and a walk every night you know which is sort of nice so I know Jeff and I of course I've been sick and he's working from home and we've never spent as much time together you know going on walks or just sitting in the living room talking and so I've been really thankful for the connections that I've made and I have promised myself that I will keep them up I don't want to ever lose those again I thank you again for watching this video and for all your kind thoughts and prayers and and well wishes for me and I just wish you all well and please just stay home wash your hands follow social distancing I mean I think it's making a big difference for us here so thank you and I hope you all have a great day bye
