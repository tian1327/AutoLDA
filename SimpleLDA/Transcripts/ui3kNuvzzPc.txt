 hey guys it's Amanda so today we are blogging and I think I might be doing a lot more of these kind of logs because we are basically quarantine for coronavirus right now all of the restaurants bars and clubs are shut down only like you can get takeout food a lot of things are shutting down and it's being recommended to just stay in the house if you can a lot of work in schools are shut down so basically what we have is this YouTube Netflix those kind of things if you're staying inside I thought this would be a perfect time to vlog and kind of see what happened this is an insane part of history happening right now and we're living through it I'm not trying to make this super light and dismiss how serious the issue is because I totally understand and I'm wishing everyone good health to be safe especially in the countries that are being hit hard like China and Italy this is our reality and we are dealing with this and a lot of us are stuck inside whether you're forced to stay inside or you're choosing to stay inside we're gonna get a little bit bored so let's kind of entertain each other I guess thankfully I hate leaving the house I hate it hate it hate it so this is like you know not the whole world infected with virus thing but being able to stay inside my house and it's supported and all of my all of my friends that are living in my house have to stay and hang out with me inside of my house you know kind of perfect dream for me so there's a lot of new things happening my boyfriend is staying here he lives in New York there's no way he's getting on a plane back there you know Christine lives with me and we got a brand new roommate which I'll introduce you guys to later you might know her and then another friend is going to be a like quarantine in the house with us so it's gonna be a crazy ride of this whole quarantine in the Stila household so yeah we got full house we've got hopefully many activities you can figure out to do we'll see how this goes it's going to be insane so I'll show you like what we've kind of like stocked up on holy our Whole Foods was like pretty stopped so we got like great things and I've always had like rice pasta beans in my cabinets just because I like to cook so I always have those kind of things around so I'm like really proud of this right now eggs eggs eggs there's a lot of people that live here eggs we all like eggs we eat a lot of eggs protein that's great we got like almost every like fake meat we can find from Whole Foods because I don't eat meat so we have all of these beyond sausages a system like brown fake meat this is you know a burger you know mushrooms strawberries always which will go bad but we'll eat them all by then this cold brew a summer I coffee I got some more fresh greens because I like to cook with those you know these diced onions vegan cheese's I got some more I don't know what it is let's have some veggies in there I have tofu I got like two of these tofu things because I can use that as protein he's like pre-made plant-based meals from Whole Foods this is like meat for my boyfriend he likes to grill that hi leo hi leo so big now and he's the cutest thing in the world I just can't I can't high five in our freezer we have just like all these like vegetables frozen that I've just had I've got a bunch of these like microwave meals and then a bunch of movies which I love the garden like this crab escapes I've never tried these fishless fillets I decided tried one of these yesterday it was really good this is all Mike and stuff so I'm like set I got half milk and this kind you can keep like not in the refrigerator so it'll last longer which we're gonna run out of but I have some canned coconut milk I guess we could use but I also have coconut cream we like to make like curry I got a bunch of tomato paste like peeled Tomatoes and then in here it's getting messy you it was just organized now it's a little bit more messy I found some more pasta this big thing of rice here somewhere we have like a bunch of rice somewhere back there there's a whole like tub of rice and also I like to think worse comes to worse we have like a bunch of these protein powders so like we'll always you know be taken care of and be healthy so leo is growing up and he is shedding his baby fur and it is a huge problem right now like so Leo's shedding and I'd like to have him on the bed with me and cuddle we're trying to cut down on that because of this issue gets on the couch and stuff and it just there's fur everywhere fur on the ground fur in my mouth fur in my hands I feel like I can't breathe that time like it's just like fur everywhere and he sheds black-and-white first so oh so just like that it just becomes all in my mouth we actually just vacuumed this couch so it looks nice now but you can imagine it's just black velvet so his work just like sticks to it this is his new toy basically you fill it with water and you freeze it and then you give it to him and you can like chew on it but it's it's not frozen anymore but you still enjoying it just play fetch with it I like to have cute things like this for the dog because I pulled out of a popsicle for myself yesterday I started eating it and he like went in to be like what are you getting I was like oh my god if you want your own popsicle and then we ate our paws schools together I also have an update that my house has gotten a lot more redone than the last time I showed you we have a lot of new things it looks amazing right now it's a little bit dirty because new roommates moving in so it's a little bit messy but I can show you guys around like what new stuff we have and what our plans are so I guess this is one of the big things that we got are these two new couches and these are from row of concepts so they come like this the couch comes like that and then you can buy an automat ottoman separate so it was really hard to figure out what to do in this area because I didn't want to block off this whole entire spot so there are lots of thinking we got two of these couches across from each other a different orientation than two of these Ottomans to go in between so we still have a little walking space here and we have enough couch space for everyone to hang out on feel comfortable watch TV so I'm gonna just be sitting on the couch on my computer working a bit and then I'll update you guys on whatever you stuff is going on and get the whole steel house quarantined gang together sit shower oh I thought you already showered you know I didn't shower I need to shave look I already got everything back I like the scruff I feel extra Spanish gonna have scruffy I think it's cute perfect dog we have to get his nails cut where are we gonna go go with the corn team no not now okay go shower so you can you can be a star on camera this is Eric Holly are you quarantine see that's an end guide to a date okay oh my god I found the best interior you're gonna love this many of

so many clothes are you done no not done not done where will they go who those are cute what size shoe are you yes christina has a tiny foot so we can never share shoes and now look at this oh these look huge so I love my new wardrobe boyfriend so I showed him a little bit in the vlog where we went on a date and he's been on my ieg TV but this is your time to show them the real you baby this is it guys this is me he's a corn timing and chilling we go yes scrolling through Netflix just Netflix chillax and eating mm-hmm he's living it good right now but he is very paranoid oh yeah thanks game I don't trust the the the newcomer in the other room oh no if he has met him but got a friend over and I don't know where he's been in the past 14 days so no skeptical oh I just I really am afraid that they're going to try to leave like I know like we could we will stay here but I think that they're going to try to leave at some point and I just don't know what we can do to make them take it seriously we have a like a corner store up the block we go to feel like candy and chip I go to the kyles like yeah I've been home for four days already he's like what really I'm like yeah as soon as I heard about a virus I was like nah man I'm staying home say less Pham say less I will stay home I will not go out I will not socialize an excuse to stay in bed with my baby forget about so we're gonna cook since I don't want her to order food from outside and we bought a bunch of food for this so we're gonna cook now what do you want so this is the easiest best pasta I do this is like fettuccine olive oil red pepper flakes basil this is garlic oh we're almost out and we don't have any fresh garlic either but I would rather use fresh garlic that's all we have and then this is like some visit truffle salt which the dog does somehow got into oh now knows how to open things so he he learned how to open this from the bottom I think and he like tore a bunch of this stuff out so that's what happened here so I'm boiling some water I wait to put salt in the water cuz they're supposed to make it salty like the sea I wait until after because I just watched one video at one time that it takes longer to boil if you have the salt in it so I do it once at oiling and then with the pasta oh well put a lot more than you think that you need always tastes better with a lot of olive oil so I would normally put like a lot more but we're literally done I swore that this was full so I was wrong Christine it's this Eric does not truffle salt lemon fresh lemon put more oil on it if you need do you like it so course you get here we got a fraud in the house Eric left good but he's gonna come back he had to see his family we hope we hope that you comes back clean and really takes it the quarantine seriously so I just filmed my ig TV that's going up this week and work and I just chillax and hang out welcome to the future of these vlogs because this is everyone that's gonna be in it so I'm glad you guys all met and we're gonna do the quarantine together I guess if I was gonna be doing it with us too so we'll see you guys will record more so thanks watching bye
