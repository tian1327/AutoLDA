just got done with the lettering so let me show you guys an update of it now we just need the heart but I really really like how this looks I can't wait for it to be filled and manda I was so pumped about getting a new tattoo I said why don't I have another tattoo like I'm just sleeping on getting tattoos surprisingly it doesn't even hurt that much it does feel like a little sting but it doesn't feel like oh my goodness I can't handle this comment down below who is scared of getting tattoos or who cannot tolerate the pain of a tattoo or comment who loves getting tattoos and feels like it's very soothing and calming for you because I know it's very very different for some people for me it's very relaxing I'm gonna say it doesn't hurt at all for those who say Oh tattoos or her I like to pay like boy it does hurt but like it's not like a unbearable pain anyways I will be right back once it's completely done and I wanna show you guys the finished product  so I finally got my tattoo finished and it looks honestly amazing I amazing family so it is the following day so it's finally out of its bandage and I have lotion it up so here you guys go this is the final result of my tattoo I'm gonna stand up so you guys can actually see it a lot better so it says Jerry and then a realistic-looking heart saying toe your last beat this is my arm relax honestly I really really love it I hope you guys dig it too and I still have yet to get bigger I like how it's like right on my bicep and I'm not trying to flex on purpose for you guys but it just looks really nice in the spot that I've put it at so let me explain the meaning of it first of all Jay was my younger brother and my little brother he was 19 years old when he passed away I know it's about to get a little bit maybe touchy and a little bit of emotional I try not to cry when I talk about my brother anymore you know it's more of like just happy moments and just great memories but on this letter that he wrote before he passed he wrote that he didn't want to die alone that he was scared to die alone so I made sure that when they disconnected my brother at the hospital that I was gonna be there for him no matter what the heart represents my brother's heart and I didn't put like a simple little harder anything I wanted a realistic-looking heart because I want people to know that this is what a heart looks like this is what is real this is you your heart is what keeps you living and this is what kept my brother living it was a conscious for like four to five days when they revived him but his heart was still beating you know when he was still alive and I know that I'm his letter he said that he did not want to die alone that he was scared and he supported me so much with everything especially YouTube so I decided to make sure that when they disconnected my brother that I was gonna be there for him till his last breath till his last beat so his heart stopped beating and that is a special moment that I would never forget with him being next to her side making sure that he didn't die alone like how he thought he was going to he didn't and I was there for him no matter what so this is the significance on my tattoo Jerry told your last beat I'm always gonna be there for you no matter what and I was always there for you till the end I Love You Man haha I'm talking to you like if you're gonna watch my video I miss him I really do but I hope you guys really really like you what are you guys thinking about my tattoo by the way like how other than my pimple looks excuse it I know you guys known to say
