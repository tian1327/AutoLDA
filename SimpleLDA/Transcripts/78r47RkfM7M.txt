 thank you for your support as we navigate this challenging and developing public health issue hi guys welcome to our vlog welcome to this episode of the coronavirus yeah I didn't get the first part of that message but that was from Kennedy's school so today is Wednesday I'm not sure why they're waiting until Monday but starting Monday March 16th her school will be closed for 14 days a minimum of 14 days today they closed all of Seattle public schools and other surrounding schools school districts as well I had a feeling we would be getting a call from Kennedy School and so starting Monday oh my gosh crazy so we're actually um we're gonna go get some dinner right now we're gonna go to Qdoba and we're still living our life and we are gonna go to the store we're not like buying into the herd mentality but we are gonna go to the store and get a few necessities we have plenty of food here we don't have a stockpile if we were to get quarantined for you know two weeks so um we're gonna go to the store and get a few what do you what do you call non-perishable food items that we can have on hand just in case but we're only gonna find what we need we're not gonna buy an excessive amount Kennedy does have a sore throat so we're keeping an eye on that but no other symptoms no fever no copying the girls as you saw went to the dentist today and Kennedy things that might have aggravated her throat because she did have a sore throat two days ago so anyway we're just keeping an eye on things but this is crazy you guys like crazy all right we're getting things that are not perishable except we did get some salad and some cheese just getting some basic things we do have princess SpaghettiOs right there and yes you can get Star Wars Chewie did you get princess and Star Wars okay and then you wanted raviolis no okay we got ramen a cup of noodles whatever cake there's still plenty of canned goods like soups and stuff we're just gonna get some more of these here's the wait where's the cold and flu stuff allergies there's some it's gone oh there's no emergency is there anything else that's like it so the only thing shot asked for was a summer sausage and this is what I was thinking but this is not summer sausage so you know at Christmas we have like your Hillshire farms summer sausage cheese and crackers and sausage oh I don't like that well that's what it is sometimes like I don't know where you find that one it's not Christmas maybe like it's cabbage so Kennedy thinks this is lettuce kisses his nose right one comes red or green no but the cabbage is the with the swipe inside I have to call Shan I don't know where I don't really know maybe from the deli you get a summer sausage from the deli ok I don't think just talking about that kind of grosses me out I don't know I don't know what he's talking about gotta be somewhere else no wait double it does not look good hold it up again do it hold it up I already did once it does not look appropriate Oh No get one that's straight it's almost worse no I'm not I don't touch don't touch it we found one 499 we made it to Qdoba oh my gosh we haven't had this in a really long time how's your chips and queso that's like the worst joke I've ever heard chips in queso is like food from heaven how's yours Kennedy is it good we haven't tried it I told the worker made them and they're like super super small so it's very brave and I asked for her let me get add more chips then there shads mondo burrito feeling pretty confident about this we haven't been here in a long time and we actually had to pay for everything except my drink my drink was free there's a huge bowl of avocados right there the biggest bowl I've ever seen they're gonna make guacamole I bet oh there now you can see it better are you wait are you want ice good morning Kenny with your crazy yeah alright one of my first duties of vacation is take this little girl to the dentist and Kennedy alright you woke up hey we have to leave in 27 minutes okay okay so we gotta get dressed and get ready to go to the dentist   hi I just got from work worked tired just got them from work and she's gonna go play volleyball tonight I'm gonna make some dinner I got a phone call today listen to this little bit of an update for you today governor Inslee announced a mandate that schools closed next week through April 24th so there you go all of our schools in the Seattle area in the three counties around Seattle are closed for six weeks this is my like I don't know it's crazy I feel like I'm missing something I don't totally understand I know we need to keep people that are more susceptible to this we need to keep them safe but I feel like there's probably thousands of people here that have this that just haven't been tested and diagnosed they think they just have a cold I don't know I just I don't know I don't see the panic and watch I'll probably end up getting it and die or something but I just I'm not I feel like I'm missing something I don't know there's me I don't know we're gonna have dinner so I'm gonna make chili and I'm totally cheating because it is a mix that I bought which one of you sweetly recommended this brand and I have used it in the past it's the Bear Creek brand let me find it in the pantry okay this is the brand Bear Creek country chickens good darn good chili and evidently you just add water to it so we're gonna give this a try I think the last soup that I bought from this brand was potato soup and Kennedy didn't really like it I don't think I ate it so you just had seven cups of water to it that's it this just has beans and spices oh and you can do it in a crock pot oops well that's not an option now but we're gonna make it oh and it cooks in 25 minutes I just thaw it says add water and tomato paste we might not be having tonight I don't think I have tomato paste so I don't have tomato paste so this is what we're gonna have tonight California Pizza Kitchen cheese pizza and then when shag gets home we have the Hawaiian one that we can make for him but this will be for the girls night all right the girls pizza is done okay I just went up and changed my clothes got into comfy clothes Kennedy said that it tastes good it's like paper thin which I don't really mind but she said tastes good so let's try it it's really good  they go me just weed you
