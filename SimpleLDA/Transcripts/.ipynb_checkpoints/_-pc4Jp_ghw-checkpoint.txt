 good morning it's Sunday and I'm working on my vlog I need to get this out for you I just finished doing some hell time workouts in my own workouts cuz it's been a minute now I am I seen my foot working in my vlog and I'm gonna take a bubble bath I'm gonna start this Sunday off great oh of course I have my coffee if you're wondering why I always have it in this mug so because one it's the perfect size in two I drink my coffee very slowly so I find that like it stays hotter longer as I happened in this random facts all right I'm gonna do my athletic try and later for you and yeah hope you're having a great day as promised my athletic try on so I wanted to show you some of the things well all the things I got so these are the elation 7/8 tight I got them in a medium petite because I wanted them to actually be 7/8 they're pretty close I like this color it's different than any that I have already and then this is the pure luxe sweatshirt this is really nice it's a crewneck it's really soft the bottom is a little tighter than I thought it might be so you can see it does cover your butt if you want it if you want it to have a sweatshirt similar so I might not keep this one but I'm gonna keep these pants this is the Zephyr crop tee with the same leggings so it is a crop tee it's a little bit longer in the back trying to figure out if it's flattering or not it is $79 I mean I got 30% off with still the material is like good tissue type not sure this is the best top for me I don't know I don't think it's that flattering this is the organic daily commute tee I am NOT a fan of this collar I do like that it goes down a little bit I don't think the sleeves are flattering this is the Sundown sweatshirt T it is sweatshirt material but it's a t-shirt I think it's cute I just have to figure out if I'm actually going to wear it and where I'm gonna wear it I should probably try it on with jeans and see what I think there this is the Sundown hooded sweatshirt and hey really cute pink color I got it in a medium and I kind of would still want some more room and this is the elation 7/8 in a medium petite same as the maroonish ones but justin black this is the off the bar sweatshirt it is an off-the-shoulder i would say a new braun right now it's quite long it has the little some holes it's super soft and i think it's like ballet and themed considering it's off the bar definitely feels it so if your dancer like you might really love this I think I might keep it I just have to figure out how often I'm gonna wear things like post quarantine you know so the last item are these shorts they're called the run short three inch they're kind of nice cause like they have like the built in brief I just don't know if I like the way they look in the front I don't think they're for me it's really hard for me to find money in Georgia by the way I'm on my walk it's an afternoon walk this time the views are amazing there are people who aren't social distancing lots of people who are not social distancing I'm gonna try and stay away from them I am Leslie - Gary be podcast and I'm walking as fast as normal because my foot is just not that good so I'm gonna get to the

it was really cold still really cold so and I needed to like wake up a bit cuz I want to shoot some YouTube videos tonight and I figured the cold brisk air I know this is mean but this is an Amazon coach I haven't done this in a while she's married one I've seen a lot through this whole quarantine there's seven said months since it was right there while I was vlogging I made you my normal walk there's no stoplight here and I cross here pretty much over to my vlog little new birth cooking okay I'm just gonna do my normal route here I did a beach way through my makeup today because I knew I was gonna shoot later looks like I'm left up until shot my hair makeup during my walk in this means I'm junkie that's me too and I'm also trying to think of YouTube and tick tock video ideas I'm just gonna keep walking in thinking I'm shooting some tick tock videos by some I mean I think I just shot 25 tick tock videos there are a lot quicker than YouTube videos so I am like I'm wiped I have been thinking a lot so I so this is very so I have some news to share a decision that I made today I have been working on my youtube channel for over six years and you've been an incredible audience and I have just over 4,000 subscribers which I have worked very hard to get those 4,000 and lately I've been looking at the views on my videos and I know I want quality versus quantity of views and you are 100% quality I it just seems that my content is not something it's not as engaging or the topics maybe it's the topics aren't as engaging to the audience so I think it's time for me to really rethink what I cover on my channel and I'm gonna take a little break I will still do these vlogs for you absolutely the vlogs or something I know they're kind of boring during quarantine but you have all shared that they're helping you and if that's the case then I still want to produce those for you when it comes to my videos on Tuesdays and Thursdays I think that I just really need to rethink the content that I want to put on my channel so I am open to ideas and I appreciate all of your ideas that you have put in the comments in other vlogs I have absolutely considered those some of them I've done others I was planning on doing like the Whole Foods haul and just my groceries are getting really warm yesterday and I needed to put them all the way so I didn't shoot it but I just I need to do something different and I don't know what that is I just need some time to think about it and I have some ideas and and if we'll see we'll see I just I just don't know and I think I made a little break and I needed to take the pressure off of coming up with content for these YouTube videos because I want them to be engaging I want you to want to share them with your friends and I want to make you laugh and I want to teach you something and so I need to I need to think about it I will still be active on Instagram I will be very active on tik-tok and it will still produce these vlogs so I'm not going away it's just the regular content of my videos will change and who knows maybe this will just be maybe this will be a vlog only channel maybe I will start actually doing things in Chicago I don't know we'll see so I just want to let you know that feel free to comment below DM me on insta text me my numbers above here and I'd love to chat about it so yeah I this quarantine has really got me thinking and I'm gonna come up with something great I just I just don't know what it is yet thanks for understanding and yeah thank you
