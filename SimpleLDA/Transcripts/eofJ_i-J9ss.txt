 hey guys it's Italia and welcome to today's vlog so as you can tell I am clearly home I just woke up it is Sunday March 15th and unfortunately woke up to the news yesterday that all mass has been cancelled in New York due to the whole coronavirus situation it's just crazy especially during Lent that this is happening it's just like I feel so wrong not going like I've been on such a good streak of getting myself to go every single weekend and Here I am but anyway today I want to have a really productive day I have been home here in New York by myself for about three days now I think or for Skyler left on Thursday and she's home now and Madison's also home I've been here by myself and I'm not really sure if I'm going to make it home or not this is ironic because this whole vlog is me leaving New York so gotcha Natalia gotcha real good because school just hasn't been very vocal about what is happening with our classes or anything so I I'm just kind of waiting it out for now so as you guys know I'm actually like very introverted and love being home and I'm such a homebody a lot of times like obviously I do enjoy going out and doing things as you can tell by this whole channel but I really love being home and being productive however the past few days I have not really done too much and it makes me feel so awful like I'm just kind of sitting here not doing anything and I need to get myself back into some sort of routine I think that's like the most important thing so I thought I would share with you guys how I am productive from home especially because I feel like a lot of us if not all of us are going to be working from home or having to be home and I don't think it's good to just mope around and do nothing of course I think it is good to self-care and if you need a day of doing that you do that but I also don't think it's good to prolong now for too long because then you just kind of feel bad about yourself because you're not really doing anything so I think it's important to accomplish a few things each day even if it's little things just to make you feel better at least that's how I work I don't know about you guys but I I feel the need to have to come things on the daily even if it's just little things to get done like I like to be able to kind of like check it off a list but anyway so I am going to get up make my bed make some breakfast and we'll get on with it    all right it's breakfast time I think eyes no from most of my videos if I am eating breakfast or I'm having my coffee I usually just watch YouTube because that's like my downtime but today like I said I want to be really productive so I'm still gonna watch YouTube but I need to make a list of things I need to get done that is like number one in a productive day I realized I haven't made a list and like whole week and that's probably why I have not been productive cuz it's like you have these things in your head that you want to get done but if you don't see it constantly you're gonna forget like you're gonna be like oh yeah I have 10 things I need to get done today halfway through that you're like what were the other five that I needed to do and then you kind of forget and then you don't get them done cuz you don't see it I'm such a strong believer in writing things down just so you remember them better so I'm gonna show you guys I literally where is my notebook I used this notebook as my little list notebook and literally it is just list after list after list after more list it's literally all lists whether it be like my grocery lists my video idea list my school supplies list like I love lists I have not made a list in a hot minute  so I've got my to-do list done I have to film a video which I am currently doing and they send in pictures for my draping project I need to watch maps online plan for this week maybe do some drawings I need to make some Instagram posts because I recently started a new Instagram it's called travel with Natalia I want to put all my travel pictures tips all that stuff on that Instagram if you guys don't know I have a travel blog as well that I really am very passionate about I love travel so much and I love like giving tips and just like showing you like my favorite restaurants or like places I went to and stuff like that and I just feel like my personal Instagram isn't the place to do that type of stuff because I'm not a travel Instagrammer necessarily so I wanted to make a separate space for all of that so I'm still posting just obviously really like older pictures from older travels and stuff like that but I want to make more posts for that I'm also doing it trilingual I'm making it in English Spanish and French so that it's more accessible to more people so there's that I'm working on getting the rest of my Italy pictures up and I kind of want to make some cute little like travel videos for it too because I have so many videos from my travels so maybe I'll do that and just kind of get that set up and dropped a lot of posts so that I can just post them easily whenever I don't have time to actually make them so that is my to-do list where today nothing crazy because obviously school is suspended so I don't really have much to do I think I just kind of have a lot of personal things that I want to get done a lot of personal goals that I want to achieve during this little break per se so I'm gonna eat breakfast so first watching YouTube and then we'll get on it  so on my to-do list for today I said film video which is what I'm currently doing but I also have a video to edit so I'm going to go ahead and do that as well as part of today because I'm supposed to upload on Tuesday and it is Sunday so I've got time but I want to get her done  okay so update I have literally just been editing all day ate lunch you know been productive had myself a time and then I checked in on the news and uh things are getting worse in New York and everything is just so rapidly changing and though they haven't announced an NYC locked down yet anything is possible at this point and that is what the mayor said I was a governor mayor one of them said that and it's on the news so I sent it to my parents and I was like maybe I should go home I'm like I don't want to be here by myself if it is going to go on lockdown so I also put it on my Instagram stories and a lot of you guys actually reached out and like told me to go home or told me that you know in Spain it's a lot worse and that's how you felt too and all these things and that really means a lot to me that I feel like all of us are looking out for each other right now so thank you for your reached out that means a lot so I talked to my dad and I'm gonna head home tomorrow there was a flight tonight I was like I have too much stuff to pack I can't do it tonight so I'm going home tomorrow at 3:00 so not my days and then turn into a packing to go home in the middle of a pandemic cool okay um sorry this video is taking a turn but you know what that's just how life has been lately so yes you can come back with me now guys I'm literally so stressed I have both my suitcases my big one in my little one I'm taking both of them because I have all his school supplies and stuff that I might need might not I don't know how my classes are gonna work so I have no clue if I need all these things today to bring everything just in case but then I was like oh my gosh my clothes what clothes in by bringing I don't even know how long it's gonna be I don't know what the weather is like I don't know if it's gonna be a month or few months do I bring summer clothes do I not bring summer clothes I literally don't know and then I realized I also still need to do laundry because most of the things that I wear on the daily basis are currently dirty so I should have probably do that I am like in this slight panic mode right now I'm gonna go do laundry put that in first I doubt anybody's doing the laundry I'm sure everybody in this apartment building his level cool I'm gonna go do that and then we're gonna pack I'm stressed this is awful like ah okay laundry time  we got 22 minutes left and I'm going to pack okay so I got my little tiny suitcase here and I think my sewing machine should fit in it she is crap she is hefty let me tell you she is like 20 pounds I really thought this was gonna fit oh wait wait guys hold up I think it fits like just right but I'm gonna have to put a lot of clothing actually is I don't think is gonna close ah it closes okay I don't even have to put so much clothing around it so that it doesn't break along the way but fingers crossed that this all works out for me updates so I put my laundry into the dryer so that is ready to go and I have packed my first little my carry-on suitcase but I'm actually gonna tuck it in because I can't just have a frigging sewing machine on my carry-on but this is what we're dealing with right now hopefully she will be okay in there I have like all my fabric in there I've got my sewing supplies over here - I've got all my drawing supplies it is just wild I have all these clothes just piled in here buying back to like  I think I'm officially done packing I just out my backpack to pack which is you know all my electronics and my last-minute stuff chargers and whatnot but I've hacked my little suitcase which is over here it was so hard to close because it barely fits so that was a struggle hopefully they don't have to open it cuz closing it is a Laura my other one I stopped to close and I need to weigh them make sure they're under fifty pounds fingers crossed because I literally don't even know what I would take out I suppose pleasure to do so so heavy so hopefully it all goes well I'm gonna weigh them hope for the best I just have to go take out the trash and yeah I think that's gonna be it as far as like prepping for tomorrow but this vlog is taking quite the turn but for the rest of the night I'm just gonna kind of clean up and get myself ready and just to make sure everything is all set to go every time I think I'm done for the day on updates and on any new news it's just not over I got an email from fi T and they have officially decided to suspend classes for the rest of the semester which now means that I'm going home indefinitely like when the heck am I going to be back I'm definitely not coming back like right after Spring Break because what the heck I am shook because they said studios are gonna be closed in everything so does that mean we even have an exhibition like do I even need to be sewing like how is my draping class gonna work they haven't addressed studio classes for designers yet and that's really difficult and really hard on us I am so stressed I would we just want to cry I don't know like when I'm gonna be back what do I need to bring how much do I need when am I going to be back here in my apartment again I don't know when am I gonna see my friends again I don't know everything is Olivo being so so fast and I feel like it's about to get so bad in the US and no one is taking it seriously and it's really pissing me off so much because all these college kids are still going on their spring breaks and traveling and thinking it's not going to affect them when it is like they're gonna be the ones to bring it back and make it worse like we all just need to chill out at home for a good two weeks let this pass and we'd be fine but no people are literally dumb and they don't think it's gonna happen to us and I strongly think that it is going to happen to us so I'm just like ah like I'm so like stressed out of my mind trying to figure out how I'm going to pack to go home for X amount of months I don't know how much I need I'm stressed out of my mind guys I this is the most restful vlog I've literally ever filmed in my entire life and I'm sorry but this is also very real and I feel like very relatable to a lot of people especially those who have to move out of dorms and stuff so fast like luckily I'm not in the dorm situation so tonight I have to like move out of my apartment or anything but it's still just the thought of like having to rapidly go home and just pack everything and leave for who knows how long and I it's just not knowing things is so hard I think for a lot of people especially for me as somebody who does like to plan things and likes to know how things are gonna go what's gonna happen I literally don't know sorry I'm just so mad I'm repacking again because now I feel like I need more stuff catch me home for a while I will update you guys tomorrow hopefully there's no more updates tonight and I will just see you tomorrow when I'm heading to the airport hopefully making it home safely with no problems along the way good night guys good morning everyone is the next today is the day that I leave I'm Loki in my fields about leaving because I've just come to really love my room and my space here and I was starting to really like New York for this semester compared to last semester and it just kind of sucks that it's getting cut short that way I feel like last semester all I wanted was to go home in this semester I was like you know what I'm gonna make the most of it and I'm like going out more and like doing fun things in New York and enjoying my time and now I have to go home which is just it's crazy how things like that work but you know everything happens for a reason and I am excited to be able to just hang out with my family and chill out at home a little bit too which will be really nice but today is gonna be a wild day I hope the airports are fine I feel like a lot of people already left the city if they were going to so like it's gonna be empty and kind of weird but we'll see so I'm gonna eat breakfast and then I'm probably gonna head out there for kind of early just because why not I haven't really gonna be empty I think most people already left last week if they were going to but who knows I'm gonna get going with my morning and I'll catch up with you guys probably when I'm leaving   so does the next day and obviously I am home I made it back to Indiana just fine and it was the weirdest ever experience of my life I was the only person through security and I was gonna take a picture of it but I got nervous because I everybody was looking at me so this is the best I could do with that picture because I was gonna take yeah I literally had my phone I think brought it up and then I just noticed the guards looking at me empty is plane ride I've ever been on wild but we made it safely I'm just gonna be hanging out at home I am working for my internship right now they're actually now hiring me since its suspended for the school year so that's been really nice school hasn't started up it starts up next week so I'm just gonna be chilling for the week and then hopefully the school kind of figures everything out for us because as a design major it is hard to do our classes online so we've no clue how they're gonna do it so just waiting on that but hopefully all of you guys are home and you are staying home and staying in I hope that you guys are not taking this time as a vacation time because I know people that are and it is really driving me crazy because the more that we wait on this whole quarantine in our selves the more it's gonna spread in the longer we're going to have to deal with this and personally I would like to have my summer and I really hope it doesn't go into the summer but at this rate of people don't take it seriously it will so hopefully you guys are staying home and safe and healthy there is light at the end of the tunnel this will pass as well so that's the only thing I can keep us going at this point make the most of it if you're creative take this time to create and really just push yourself to do whatever you want if you've always been caught up in the hustle of life which is me take some time for yourself have some self-care days and just chill out a bit too so hopefully you guys take this time to do something good for yourself and treat yourself to something good so that's what I'm gonna leave you guys but sorry this vlog was a little bit all over the place I started with I'm gonna have a nice practice day and then ended with ah I'm queen New York shouldn't heat so but such is life nowadays so what are you gonna do about it alright that is it for today's video and I will see you guys in the next one bye
