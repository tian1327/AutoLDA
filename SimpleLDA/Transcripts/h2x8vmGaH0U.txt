  if you're like us then corona canceled by your travel plans and you're slowly going stir crazy in your apartment i asked chris to send me some footage of what he's been up to in quarantine and this is what he sent me uh it's 12 30 pm and i'm still in bed if this was the truth about my quarantine this is it here are some unsolicited advice learn a language if you plan on traveling to a non-english speaking country even just having a rudimentary understanding of the language will help you appreciate the culture and interact with the natives and they'll be really excited to see that you put some effort in which is exactly what happened when i went to japan here is me studying some very practical vietnamese that chris taught me exercise when we can travel again your body needs to be ready for long walks hikes and thirst trap photos just kidding you don't have to get ripped just move your body if you can go outside go outside something always brings me back to you i was a personal trainer for three years and a lot of our clients would come in with aches and pains because their office jobs were super sedentary it's so easy to fall into the same trap at home but one of the benefits of not having to go to the office is that you can just get up whenever you want and do 10 squats or stretch or pace around like an npc accept your circumstances this whole thing sucks i think a lot of people feel like they're living some abnormal sub-optimal version of their lives but there is a silver lining in this abnormality there is no better time to try out new habits recipes lifestyles now that we have such a large degree of control over our lives i'm trying intermittent fasting i've stopped caring about how long my hair is i wear barrettes to keep hair out of my face hell i've stopped caring about everything for the first time ever i feel like i'm finally free of other people's opinions it took not interacting with anybody for weeks for me to realize the cumulative effect that their collective voices had on my psyche to be fair i am an introvert so this might not be as relatable for you extroverts like chris the first two weeks were really rough take care of your extroverts everybody stay home and stay safe use a lot more meat than uh most people because i like my knee when mixing music you know recreate the music festivals that i've been wanting to go to with andy  i read a lot
