 good morning it's Sunday   so clearly I decided to keep walking it's very cold so this is the loop behind me where a lot of people work it's just crazy to see it's this town I mean I realize it's early on a Sunday morning but during quarantine but it's still just I'm afraid I've walked so far but I'm gonna be frozen when I finally get out I'm almost up with my coffee and I'm making a second one I got another coffee from the same Dunkin Donuts and now I'm headed home I got a smaller one this time meaning I got a medium and know how someone was a large I am gonna be off the walls my boyfriend wakes up he's not gonna know what happened this is great also my mouth is frozen so I'm talking weird I don't think I believe in my house the rest of the day unless we don't run errands somewhere so it's probably ematic don't think I'm about to attempt to reorganize this to give you an idea what we're working with all of this I just got some new that's new and we have all that and something to give this shot I think I'll try the time lamp so if I can get bangle right and then also I feel better about myself when I see the before and after  then there's more up here but this is all clear I'm gonna clean this and then figure out how to reorient I don't know quite how they do that yet so I've categorized half of this this is the half I have not this is like hair stuff I've gotten rid of a lot but I'm gonna show you how I categorized and then I'm gonna figure out how to put it all up in there so here's the finished product project product whatever you want to call it alright so let me explain kind of the method to my madness so I have all of my little scoops in here I have a central oils body oils some extra body lotion and then my deodorants over here is like my everyday face stuff so I have my cleanser I have a bomb that I found that I want to use eye makeup remover serums vitamin C retinol moisturizer self-tan moisturizers then we move to their stuff I don't not explain this I don't know how it all fit but I have a problem so there's hair sprays back there there's air dry sprays this whole thing is beach wave and texturizers and volumizers and volume and dry shampoos just made my perfume look a little prettier and then put these little guys on top down here I did my nail stuff and then some extra hair travel items and then down here are my face masks like actual mass and then some liquid ones and then some face wipes and then down here it's all my extra face stuff so I have some masks right here really extra I just want to get rid of the ones at the top so Mike regret no exfoliator self-tans there and then my nail polish remover is there because it wouldn't fit in this one I feel pretty accomplished because this was quite the mess before and well that's not closing all right yeah so now I am gonna just shelf but I need like stop buying hair products it's getting a little excessive I am making pico de gallo with the tomatoes that we have lime red onion cilantro and salt I don't have a jalapeno but I'm totally okay with that good morning it's Monday a hunt today I got an extra large coffee instead of stopping and dunking twice I thought maybe I'm just getting extra large I've never ordered this size at Dunkin before it's quite large and happy and hot a couple things about that first of all to hold out like really we're not dressed properly so yesterday Duncan in there looked like she was about to perform surgery because she had the masking gloves it was like fully protected totally appreciate that this morning this woman had a face mask it just wasn't covering her mouth and nose and she had no gloves on slightly concerning what yeah thank you for all your comments on my last vlog we're all so sweet I got text messages and just really nicely here so thank you um a lot of what you all had said is that you love seeing Chicago while I'm on my morning walks and so since I had to go to Duncan again which throws me a little bit off my normal path not far it's like where I would normally walk to get on the El for everyone to work I thought I would do it a loop and just show some additional things that's you normally know to my walks all right right now it's very boring so I'm gonna wait I'm gonna listen right podcast boom it's how I built this one of my favorite podcasts and love learning how company started and it's about Brooke Lennon I have Brooklyn and cheats I love Brooklyn and very excited to listen to how this couple started the company so me and my extra-large coffee are gonna do that it's getting warmer maybe because of my extra large coffee and I'm walking down Chicago Avenue and I just anthropology urged Iraq now I'm coming up to my favorite place to grab lunch like ladies who lunch girlfriends summer lunches even winter lunches it's RL and let me tell you oh it just passed it and uh it's my favorite I love it there's steak sandwiches amazing things and we have this gorgeous outdoor patio like right here here's the restaurant so when you visit Chicago I mean we can eventually travel again that is someone that you want to go and just message me I'll join you because sometimes I go there by myself because I'm like wanting to go so badly all right we're gonna want to tell me some Avenue you send them being like an hour-long walk  Tuesday and I have my extra large coffee again from Dunkin it is actually warm out even though it looks like okay warm it feels like it's 49 it feels warm here in Chicago and a lot but people are out for walks it's a little bit later than I know my dog to walk but sometimes I go for too long I mean the amount of people out like normally I don't see anyone this is random so my birthday is coming up in June June 2nd and as of right now stay at home order and Chicago gets look did May 30th either way my boyfriend and I were thinking about going somewhere for my birthday we should go on trips for our birthdays last year is New York it's definitely not happening this year and for me for him it's Vegas every year so I've been trying to figure out where we should go we would give him Airbnb ideally I'd want like a pool in the backyard and he what falls so far we've come up with Scottsdale and oh this can not be a trend that I see dead birds every morning oh let me say Scottsdale air forgot where else but this is where it love you the ideas I'm totally down for going east and lumping expose again that was so marswell not being around people how doesn't have to be small I just want to get an air B&B where I don't have to be around a lot of people and also they're probably gonna drive and think Arizona is probably the furthest we'd want to drive West so where should we go Florida's out of the question I just I don't want to go to Florida so yeah I need your help let me know where should we go it feels like well I know what it feels like it's 68 out feels so good so I decided from my last like 20 minutes of lunch
