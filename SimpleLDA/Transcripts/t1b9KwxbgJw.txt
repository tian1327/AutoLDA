 I just wonder why we're all coughing differently but I feel like they're not coping the best way and they're messing my life up hello everyone long time no bike kind of a strange time all around to be well to be on the bike and to be a person in the world so I hope everyone's holding up cool and doing their best and I hope things if they're not so great I hope that they get back to normal or better than normal for you really soon I'm out on the east side of Milwaukee right now it's kind of cold out earlier today was in the mid 50's and sunny which have been really nice to get out I was out for a little bit but I don't really vlog now it's kind of its kind of getting cold oh man I wish I had a camera on the other side because there's a partially burned house that's kind of interesting but maybe you'll see it over on that side when I pass it yes I was like uh ha to know 40-something degrees Fahrenheit which is bit a bit brisk kind of hard cuz I don't really know how to proceed I don't know what to talk about and I mean I've always got stuff going on in my head but I think a lot of people who are publishing content online are kind of at the crossroads of whether they should be you know talking about topical things or if they should be a bit bit escaped I kind of you know don't want to dwell too much on stuff that's just me and to be honest like a lot of my day-to-day is it's pretty similar I'm lucky that I've always been working remote yeah already kind of had like limited contact with people I don't interact with a ton of people on the day day things have been pretty typical for me the same but different just making it work so I hope you're making it work too for a lot of people it's kind of a great time to be writing right now I'm on the University of Milwaukee campus it's cool spot actually took a drawing class out here you're curious it's really interesting it's pretty smallish campus actually this is a random fun Milwaukee fact is here if you're down for it walking has like a ton of universities downtown area I mean this is more than a free side but we got Marquette University downtown the School of Engineering is downtown I'm probably forgetting a few things it's kind of a lot of Education around here a lot of things to be learned it feels so funny I'm very out of practice of making videos I've enjoyed making them about other people and about the community and that's gonna be harder now so so long as all the social distancing keeps up it'll just be you and me which that's not so bad he'll have a nice time I'm seeing a shocking amount of people it dogs out sometimes it feels like there's more people out than ever but I know everyone's schedules are upset everything's kind of strange and different grocery stores are weird look sue your sister is super weird I know it's just this is hard to know how to behave if I'm being honest about my light I have not been sleeping well and it's not because I've been up at night with fears of viral outbreak and mass hysteria it's because my next-door neighbors have been partying relentlessly stop me if this is boring you can't but my neighbors I've been like every single day to having people over and about the music and I'm down apartment so like we share a wall and they're they're fighting and they're crying and they're getting sick and I can hear everything and I just wonder I just wonder why we're all coughing differently but I feel like they're not coping the best way and they're messing my life up I beat on their wall and a couple instances of and I'm talking I'm talking three a.m. one time that's four I am blasting music 4 a.m. I don't remember if it was a Sunday or froze a weekend even those a weekend for EM that's that's too late shut up like why are you still up but yeah no no it doesn't matter doesn't matter a day of the week doesn't matter of time they're nocturnal now and even if they aren't partying they're just living life loud that's been a harsh in my vibe a little bit I'll tell you that much it's been harsh in my vibe I'm working on it so I hope you guys are having a restful time I'm definitely trying to like take it easy on myself why not I mean I can continue to theoretically work at the same rate that I have been but it's harder it's hard to focus there's a lot more to know and think about and there's a lot more to uh oh wait what why did you have your blinker on Jesus you saw that right oh you didn't see that because the camera is the other way anyways they change their mind oh yeah now you're certain I bet I know everyone's good turn one too that's great so yeah I don't know here you can see from behind me this is Oakland it's never really like a crazy pop in street because it's not like it has nightlife or a lot of restaurants per se it's kind of more retail but kind of ghostly yeah it's just been kind of hard to focus and I'm just trying to be nice to myself for when I get distracted and then so you can just start each new day from scratch and that that usually helps do not feel like you know your productivity shot and to be honest like I didn't know just taking care yourself to be the main goal right now productivity in the sense that you're just not wallowing and keeping up the spirits in making money where you can but usually got a lot of words but lately I'm kind of lost for words I feel like I have less to say my husband's just kind of quiet which is nice it's raining just a little bit I wonder if you could tell it's been kind of nice to just chill and and read and write I've been doing a lot of writing I've always written a lot I haven't mentioned it a whole bunch on the channel but I've been writing poetry forever and I did get some individual problems some individual poems published in 2017 I've been trying to play the traditional academia route but you know we'll see where all that goes but yes that's that's what I do because I do a lot of things on the side and behind the scenes I think you guys get that no one's ever like you know knocking down my door demanding videos or if they do I don't see it all right but yeah I just wanted to do a little ride around town there's nothing to see I could I don't have like a helmet mount for this summit right now I could have put it on maybe a strap mount but I know I feel like I've always just troubleshooting moto vlogging and that's just bad on that I've helped one local business set up online ordering so that was cool but they weren't getting a ton of volume and they do coffee so you know the the time sensitivity on coffee is a bit of a thing so hopefully they can make it work and maybe pivot the way they've been doing it I still got plenty of projects in a lot of my own projects it was a great time for me to buckle down and wrap up a lot of my personal project stuff personal project being like great lakes of like oh it's like business maybe I should say personal projects is like knitting but anyways Great Lakes supply co new designs I've had a lot of samples and they look awesome and I've teased a few things on the Instagram accounts so you should be following those if you're Matt curious otherwise okay email lists I've got all sorts of things yeah it's been cool just design tickle on apps cuz I have to because I've been kept up every night all night it's acts easy you know you get half asleep then you don't want to get out of bed to like knock on their door or complain mmm-hmm so you just suffer and like a half sleep but I'll I know I'm feeling spry out I'll take you guys down Brady Street so you can see that's an absolute ghost town I was right along it earlier it was so weird it felt like something was missing and I couldn't figure out what it was I'm like did they take away like a bunch of flower planter boxes or I couldn't totally tell it was and it might be that there's like zero trash Oh wolf Jesus there's gums oh man I should even look okay that would have sucked I think that sometimes when I'm going to vlog in like me I don't think they saw me in an accent that's bleak yeah but I think maybe what's missing is like the people it's missing as a people and that's kind of the case a lot of places it's all very strange I'm sure you guys you guys know but there's a lot of spots on Brady that are boarded up why they're temporarily or permanently sometimes it's kind of hard to tell definitely a reckoning for small businesses or businesses they can't really pivot to being online or carry out and it's a it's a bummer because you know while I do love the Internet it's so great for building community and networking and meeting people like all over the world I still really cherish in-person stuff in-person culture in life now it's like a bunch of people everyone's on their run walking their dog but man yeah over here they must have taken something out because it looks so empty it's weird but yeah there's no people oh you know it's all the outdoor furniture yeah because no one can sit outside that's what's missing okay glad I got to the bottom of that it's just like freaking me out this place has like taped up windows or ones drawn the drapes and there's still some places that are doing carryout but the most part it's All Quiet on the Western Front the Eastern Front I'm an introvert but I it's not that I don't go out of my house I think that's like kind of a misnomer like oh you're introverted you just stay home all the time it's like maybe you're introverted you stay interior most the time but that doesn't mean that you stay home home you have to stand in your head or it's just lower stimulus environments and to me like I love going to a coffee shop feeling those vibes kind of see people in passing just kind of observing a lot of the world and not having to interact with everybody and that's kind of how much you miss out on so you know I'm taking advantage of even moderately comfortable riding weather and it's kind of nice to is like no traffic it's 6:00 p.m. on a Saturday and maybe it would've been a low anyways it's only 6:00 p.m. yeah it just feels so much later can't see anything there's no Sun that's what's weird too is it's spring but it's not quite sprung it's just kind of a lot of gray days man I suppose not any crazier than staying inside a ton and having moving tons and tons of gray days outside some people are acting like ratty in his social distancing appropriate and like well I'm literally not touching anybody or anything so I don't know I guess feel free to roast me but I think we've been pretty responsible anyway so I think I'll I'll end this relatively uneventful strange blog here I mean update on me things are okey things are just fine doing my thing and in having some me time baby so I hope you're having lots of you time in enjoying it and I know reading a book or something thanks for watching subscribe if you have it you should stick around things get cool over here sometimes
