  I also don't even know why I'm vlogging because chances are I'm not gonna do anything like this but you know what I thought why not because I need a video for Saturday so much just vlog in my life during quarantine or like stay shelter at home whatever it's called it's like just afternoon I've been working sending emails break this is how I have been staying busy during shelter at home so already breakfast I can't show you what I ate but I had an espresso and then I made an everything bagel with cream cheese and then a little bit later I made homemade peanut butter cookies yesterday I was craving something sweet so I did that so living my best life I've also been watching YouTube videos so like I have like a nice like dual monitor thing going on right now so I'm able to work on this one well like I have work okay I'm both like I have my email on this one and I'm sending stuff through like a CRM system on this side but then I can also watch YouTube so like let me show you what I mean so like this is my like main monitor and then this is where I have like my YouTube and email up there so yeah honestly right now my life has consisted of me yelling at Remy like he has been so so obnoxious like to the point where I'm like what is wrong with you keeps jumping on my xbox and like trying to go behind my computers and the one time he did that she got stuck like his net he was playing underneath my second monitor and he was like on his back and his claws like this and he got his claws stuck and like this speaker holes and it was actually traumatizing so yeah so I guess that I will just keep working and I we'll take you along my little quarantine journey we'll see how this goes I'm gonna steal my seat are you gonna terrorize me oh there you go little monster see look this is what he does I want to kill him Ramy what are you doing Remy Remy hey Remy Remy hey get down this is what my ass my day has looked like always he loves his avocado he gets so mad at weeks I won't let him on my xbox Brett and you start flicking his tail back and forth Lemmy stopping bad me no no Remy Remy no so cute they so mad Remy no when you jump from there he like slides into my TV Remington Remy no no no Remy cut it out I want you to say for yourself Remy she's such a monster this vlog is mostly gonna be me yelling with him Remmy get done' Remy and if you're wondering why I don't want him up there it's because he jumped up there and then he climbs on my xbox and eight it's bad for my xbox and then B he goes behind the TV and then I'm afraid you're gonna knock it forward because if there was any cat to do that it would be him so get down Remy Remy get down he's such a monster I mean wait lunch early dinner basically all it is is noodles broccoli oil cheese and seasonings and Walmart's jeans a lot better than this one from Aldi because the only one really because the only one really you should have I couldn't I couldn't even see the master so it's weird yeah so to conclude my stay-at-home day I'm not facetiming sell high social distancing love that you being a monster I think the answer yes so it's next day it's Friday thank God and I end the vlog so I figured that I would have on here and say toot-a-loo so I hope you enjoyed a day in my life of social distancing and let me know if you want to see more things like this so yeah I love you guys I see you in the next video good
