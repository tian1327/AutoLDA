   good morning guys I decided to start my day off by going in a run I stopped out this pond that we have in our neighborhood because it's really pretty there's always ducks which won't stop following me and I don't like them but it's really pretty there's like a trail of trees um but yeah I'm like sweating and I'm a out of breath but I'm almost done I'm about to head back to my house okay so I just got back I'm running and I've had some time to cool down obviously because I had to refill the fridge and made myself some water and then I got some breakfast so I'm gonna be eating the yolk lay strawberry yogurt and then I just went ahead and made some toes oh no I just dropped that so and I literally just brought it in a napkin because there's no sense I'm wasting a paper plate for a piece of bread you feel now I'm gonna get started with my high school online schooling and then finish any college work I need done so yeah that's what I'll be doing now wait a second this isn't even due until tomorrow that means I need to attach my teacher that I'm here since until tomorrow but I'm gonna do it today anyway I've been drinking so much water lately like I don't know what it is maybe that you just haven't had a lot of like soda as options in our fridge but I literally I want to say I drink like 5 to 7 water bottles per day which I don't know if that's a lot but I feel like it is I don't know all right well I'm gonna do this assignment let me see I'm gonna do my I have a volleyball class so I literally have assignments every day for volleyball class which so annoying I'm not seeing an assignment for today no no assignment okay so I finished my high school work and now I'm moving on to college to see if I have anything to do today which I think I have a few math assignments but I got an email from my professor that um the like browser that we go through to do those is down so yeah me but I'm gonna eat my yogurt now and then I'm gonna brush my teeth because I don't like to brush my teeth until after I've eaten breakfast because like what's the point so yeah so I've finished all of my work I just have to help some friends because you're all asking me to help them with their work  okay so now I just change and I'm going to eat a salad for lunch it's just a premade like Caesar salad it's so good I definitely recommend it so I'm just gonna eat that for line also I just wanted to quickly mention on another favorite of mine is a ginger salad if you guys have a Makoto's near you and you get the ginger dressing from there it's like a hibachi grill it is so bomb on a salad like it's so good so I recommend that if you guys don't want to eat something as heavy as like a Caesar salad that's a that's like always a healthier option    quick the  yo hotel

orange swimsuit underneath still and I'm just sitting over here reading Sadie Robertson's book called live fearless and it's really good it's mainly like kind of based off of faith like how to trust God and stuff and like let go of your fears so I've been reading that and I'm really liking it and I suggest to check it out also I need to turn off the lights in our outdoor kitchen so that I don't get in trouble but yeah that's all I've been kind of doing we played her out with a volleyball a little bit but that's pretty much it I think I'm gonna try a recipe tonight for fried rice I'm not sure if I can do it but I kind of want to try and I know I can cook zucchini and onion so I'm gonna have that and then maybe like some chicken or something like that so we shall figure it out together don't go refill my water real quick though so here's my dinner it's just this fried rice and then this chicken and I'm gonna put some of this teriyaki sauce into it food Hey so I'm about to do some laundry and then I think I might change a new like a little short workout before I take a shower and get ready to go to sleep it's pretty late right now it's like 10 o'clock I think or 10:30 maybe 11
