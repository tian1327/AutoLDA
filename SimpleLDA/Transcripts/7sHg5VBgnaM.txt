 the modern name deep cruel it is Sunday I don't know the date of the week it is that this bill is a Saturday and it's about a old 7:00 in the morning I woke up really early I I just woke up early I've been waking up early I went to bed a little bit early left the bed at like 10:30 and I watched right here and put this up did a breed out I'll see how it turns out if I take it out later today to record a video I'll let you know how it turns out but I any time I wash my hair I guess it makes me sleepy does anybody get the same feeling when they watch they hear you get like sleepy earlier for this lot of work like that watch the condition it will dry it your arms are moving it's a lot especially when you have natural hair so yeah that made me sleepy so then that caused me to wake up earlier today so I figured I wake up I did some cleaning in my bedroom or my pass I'm actually I have some stuff sprayed in there and I'm just cleaning there later I'm going to do some reorganization with my kitchen a little bit my kitchen is very clean this is a rigid apartment guys so I'm not like doing anything extra extra I was thinking about painting during this quarantine but I have to order paint and everyday and I don't know a home to do all that but I thought about it I said painting something I don't know but I have this little cart that I got for Christmas and I can use it as a prep station when I cook and I don't remember my video before I was like I need a like more counter space so I was thinking taking my microwave I'll stuff it in my friend cat about this taking my microwave she actually gave me a little bit of that day of the idea and I was like do that take my microwave put about top of my fridge rater and then use this for prep or like an extra counter so I don't have to do everything of this one counter I'll show you guys how it looks but this is what I'm planning on trying to organize a bit and seeing if it could work up their efforts so it's Santa comet boy I figured I start this early and not have to wait to the boom today but I get lazy enough like I like doing this but I'm trying to start off this week being more productive because last week for the bus I literally was just laid into bed watching Netflix and I had my lady friend I don't like doing I don't like working out during it so I just don't work out during that time so that was made me feel extra not productive so I'll show you what I'm gonna do hopefully it works out and then I'll show you the finished product I have all like short shorts right now so I'm not gonna be showing like everything else and I'm not changing my shorts because I'm just not doing it I like changing people with the jams up and yeah hope you guys don't have anything morning so far whatever your wiseman watching this hoping you're having a good day and let's get started with this organization okay so this is the little cart thing I got from Christmas one Christmas microwave my garbage is there my cat Bowl don't worry about that I gotta put some food and then my federated has all this stuff at the top let me know if you figure a guy stuff at the top like mine do cuz mine does I got I blender up their snacks my proteins breathe by KitchenAid that's back there that I haven't used yet some tea yeah so I use this extra shelf but we're gonna figure this out cuz ever see if I could put some of this stuff down there or organize that a little bit better so we're going to see something that's the project today this right here and this right here I'm hoping it's gonna work out and then if I say hi to blue she'd be a little bad this morning look oh those things for you know could you be a bad oh don't rub on me you know who Oh mommy hey alright alright yeah let me get started I just I just wanted to show the only place at my kitchen that's really organized as my seasoning cabinet I did this like maybe last week or two weeks ago so I have three shelves in here of everything that I use to cook up here it doesn't go all the way back because I stopped pushing stuff all the way back because I wasn't finding stuff and I forgot I would have stuff so I had to push everything forward but this is all my Rice's I need to get like a rice Catina for certain races but the rice is here I have a spaghetti sauce is pancake mix affectionate sugar I think that's how stuffing and another kind of pasta I have corn bread back there honey there's coconut flour I have a cake mix kind of buzz oops I was gonna make a cake but I never made it come down here main seasonings I have it separated by Jamaican food Jamaican seasonings regular Americans seasonings like my ground pepper ground even though it's not American but in my head that's how I split it up lemon pepper this is like the American side this is like my sweet my ground nutmeg my cinnamon all my old days I have three different kinds of old day and then the big real old day back there I have these guys paprika I have garlic salt have my pepper grinders peak Himalayan regular sea salt and this is another sea salt or salt I got for my job this is my sauces that are open and not open so this is my hot sauce my scotch bonnet sauce and there's two not open ones back there and then this is just an extra lemon flavor and then this is my Asian section so I have like sesame oil I have curry paste like my whole Asian section so everything I split up by the world technically and then down here I have my salt I'm just gonna pop it up because it's better these are my cans the cake I was gonna make a dump cake with the peaches but I never did it but maybe I'll do it this time I don't know and then these are the recipe canned food this was for somebody and he's to eat them but and I just kept up there I don't know they're - it's tuna and then this is my noodle section noodles I have soup here really good shin-young owed over I don't know but they're really good my death is in the regular markets and I stay a little spicy if you like spice they're good if you don't you may not be like them that much but you don't have to put the whole packet in there so just don't hold you on the packet and you should be fine but yeah that's my cabinet there and then all of my plates don't judge me yes I have some paper but I have some even now real plates on my plates and glasses are in there which are not bad that's not bad this I'm going to organize a little bit better it's organized but I'm using a lot of the bowl that go in here isn't my frigerator so I started to look a little something right now but we're gonna fix that okay this is about this is the size of my kitchen as you see like it's like from there to there I'm there so I have lots of cabinets on this side this side no cavities frigerator and my little a little counter thing so this is like my little cleaning section and then you walk in I was thinking about getting rid of this I may get rid of this I got I gotta like it's it's coming I may do that this is my little tea section I need to look like Amazon for like a tea holder but I don't know if it's gonna fit all the t's I have cuz I have tea inside there I have tea here I have 20 years so I want something for that my sink situation I have dish soap and I have hand soap I have boats and I love this little thing because I don't like having like the containers on my counter it looks I just don't like the way it looks so I thought I found this and it has like a little thing but to put this inside of here this stuff is the best if you're looking for anything that cleans your stove and your counters like right away especially after you just cooked this is the best fantastic tough grimes when you spray it on there as you're cooking and you won't have to worry about cleaning your sink like that so I have my trainers on my canisters I have all of my utensils I decided to put my grater here I have some spaghetti here I kept just the fish grease don't judge me I showed you guys Zach already stole this I and this was the main area because I wanted to take the microwave from off top of here so I could actually prep food here I put my machines like when you work at you know where I work at if you weren't there you see you get mad like machine so I have like my KitchenAid and I have my food processor my conversion I have my blender back there and my red mixer is there nothing can't really fit down there so I just have my griddler um the baking rack some water and I so like I said I will be prepping food up here I kept the clean wrap in the wax paper so if I need to like put something out on this I will use this so this will be more space for me like counter space wise and if I need to use any of this stuff I can just put it up here plug it in and I can do what everybody to do over here I think that's a good idea this is my car yes in New York we have cards if you don't have a car in New York good for you but I'm a pedestrian so we need our card so I have to keep that their garbage days I fed my cat don't think I don't feed my cat I gave Lulu I know I said I will go feed her and then this is the microwave situation so microwave is able to go up here I'm able to easily open it up it is not plugged up because and this apartment can't see over there I have one slug and I need a three-prong so I have a Miss and an extension cord but it's only a two prong so when I want to throw them a maganda suite I'm gonna order that I put my snacks and stuff back here it's not that much of it so I just squeezed it back there overall it is clean in here in here only thing I did was like straighten up like the bowls like I said a lot of it is already in my Fitch Raiders and once I start cleaning that out and this will be filled back up and I decided to put my mixing bowls up there so everything is all organized the next thing I have to organize what she wanted eat here know that none of the if I say don't touch me yeah I gotta organize this that has to be organized and then I still have lots of bags in here I know they said we're not supposed to carry the plastic bag some places were still giving them so I kept it and yeah so it is 9:52 and I started to say 8 o'clock so this took about 2 hours also because I was singing and dancing and trying to figure out where to put stuff at so yeah it's done I'm proud I got some stuff done first thing this morning and I'm going to wait to continue maybe I'll do this cabinet now to get it over with so I don't have to do it later because I just overdid it I feel kind of embarrassed about it let me do that ok I clean down there it wasn't as bad as it looked I just needed to shift around some stuff but yeah so I have I clean myself under there some cleaning rags I have my wet jet the things that go underneath it I have some sprays yeah so that's what's under there and it's cleaner diaper gonna take them on it looked like maybe 10 minutes not even you wanna see how mean she is look look look see see me look at him be nice be nice put your damn poor down put your paw down rude mean ass that being so mean you gonna make me hit you my bacon inside of this leg to Tina once again I'm all about aesthetic I don't like when the package is in my frigerator I actually do like this thing and then I have my pancake mix inside of this I got a Crate and Barrel years ago like years years ago so you just squeeze it into the pan when you want to make your like pancakes and I do this to like I said make it convenient for myself so about the it's a frying up the bacon and making my pancakes are okay it's not gonna take that long and this morning I want to tea so I'm gonna put them in the tea corner over here and pick me out of tea okay my pancakes will be perfect I don't care that they're not perfect the only way they come out really perfect is if you make a morning griddle and that makes them perfect but I make them in the pan with butter so yeah then I call the perfect but that's my pancakes so five I like to leave my kitchen clean so there's nothing on the stove only there's to take nothing in the sink with a little spatula everything is cleaned up I like to leave my kitchen clean I will not leave out of my kitchen without it being clean before I sit down to eat because nobody want to come back in here and clean up after you've been Anita this is what happens when I try to report a video I'm trying to set up my makeup and stuff and you guys yes I set it up on my hamper and I'm bout to turn the lights on it's tough but you see this cat she just jumped on my leg jumped up here look at this what what is what are you doing excuse me I need you to get down get down look you're gonna have to get down and you go thank you bye-bye so as I wait from my battery to frickin charge I thought it moving some stuff around on my living room of course  selfies in the mirror so that's why the light is there so I was taking pictures there I moved before like when I showed that I was watching Netflix I had too much greenery going on there and I just put that stuff there but it wasn't really cool to stay there I really want a new console and I have one at my job that I really want to get it's like baby blue and it's a lot higher than that this guy is low but I'm plotting on that if the trunk check come I may get that with the truck check but anyway I have this empty space here this mirror used to be here but I moved it here because I like having the background look better because you know I have my bookcase in my bed so I like that better hello blue how you doing with moments and she goes yawning you tired - doing what anyway yeah so that's why I put that there my plan I'm thinking I'm gonna go on Amazon and look I want a big fern like a big faux plant to go there and that will take up that space right there because I want to also block those wires and in this corner I have this Voss here but if I can find something a little bit taller than that to go there I'm not sure what I would want to put there if anybody has any ideas no but I want something else they're here I can't technically click anything I know if you're looking at the sofa you're like well why don't you put any table there I don't really need an end table this is where that soft box goes when I'm not using it and I turn it around and it actually looks like a studio when it's there so it's alright like it still goes with the aesthetic cause it's still black and what like it's black so it still goes and these are not like an ugly like bright ass color that don't go and then I'm looking for something to go above this wall and this is my sofa don't look at the pillows I am believe me I know the pillows are ugly I need the pillows pillows are very hard to really decide on so these gotta go believe me I know sofas too pretty to have them ugly to have a lovely clothes so I need something to go above this wall I've been looking at some canvases that I really like one has the lips and it's like graffiti on it cuz I want something with color the only hard thing with these walls is because there's molding so you either have to get something that's the same or something that's similar or I could do a picture gallery but I don't want to do a picture gallery because I have one there so I'm gonna I don't want to I really don't want to do that I really just want two big canvases to go right there so that's what I'm thinking I'm like looking around and I want to put a chair here so I tend it like I want to put a nice chair here and then I really want these Ottomans to be right here they're kind of like Capitol office like this is where the liver will kind of start so if that makes sense and move my coffee my coffee table booths here and there so it's alright and then my ring light technically my ring light could probably just go in that corner and just be there until I'm ready to use it so I don't have to put anything in that corner I could just have the plant here and then I'll be done with my living room I could find those pieces so but I really want this like this thing to go away like I wanted to go because I have another vision and I'll be in this apartment for another two years so I need to really I want to upgrade update some stuff so there's a little setup don't judge me that is a hamper use what you got to use it so you guys you get what you really need it's okay but my hamper is a good height so kind of like a table I have a table on my Amazon cart or whatever so I'm just I'm gonna I'm gonna adventure the order it's like a folding table and it will be a lot better when I sing like that but I have this softbox like it's by full VTech I got this from also Amazon all this stuff I got from Amazon by the way except for the camera tripod ring light the softbox all got it from Amazon so if you put the softbox on like and I'm still figuring out the softbox a little bit but that's there I have it all up and it all goes around that way you come around here and this is what I have my makeup set up at the camera I don't know what is missing here but for some reason this does not stay up like it used to I don't know what I don't know so I just put kosis there don't judge me that's not the way it's probably gonna because I have to play around with where i'ma sit my levels and all of that kind of stuff and then my little background I have there I am going back and forth between if I should get one of those pilot backgrounds but I really need more space to do that so I think I'm just going to stick with what I have because like literally I would have to get like a rod the paper to put behind me but I was thinking of doing that in my bedroom not necessarily here because I like this and I don't want to mess with this oh yeah and then my laptop is there because I have whatever's on my laptop well whatever's on my camera bounces back to my laptop so I could see myself and I can adjust the settings on my camera from my laptop because there's a specific app that goes with your camera to your computer so yeah that's what I have that's the softbox just gonna look a little funky but that's the softbox ring right and everything like that and then I sit in this chair I'm also looking for a better chair so a table and a chair soon come it will happen I just gotta get it together but for now this is what I use to record the bad and this is what I was talking about as far as being able to see myself on my laptop for my camera and I have the settings there so I can change the settings I can change like if I want to take a physical picture I could go to the picture setting and just put it on timer all that good stuff and my light is there I opened up the curtain a little bit and yeah so thank God for this and being able to see myself it works out really well and I am sitting here wage training do you see my way street we've trained it on and I'm sitting in my chair okay so I'm about to look for it I have my lights set up I'm looking at the camera right now I think I look fine as far as like the setting I was trying to play around with the settings with it anyway too much I'm still learning and yeah it's it's a little scary when you start playing with the settings and you're like wait do I look too bright do I look too dark and you know making sure you make you could see like if I turn it down yeah I'm gonna record a video I'll be doing my makeup and just sitting here chatting cuz it's great to you guys and I'm just speaking about things that's going on and then I'm gonna take my hair out see how this looks if I don't like the video you will not see the video if I like the video you will see it so let's just hope the footage comes out good okay move it come on you can do it you can do it   so the it girl is hungry the girl is hungry I don't know where the time went it is already like past 7:30 I made breakfast I think as I had a late breakfast I walked some all-american then I started to record once it started to record that took up mad time I looked at the time it goes like 5:30 once I was doing my last video then once I was done with that I had to charge my battery so I took some time took some pictures dance announce the music waited at least 30 minutes 40 minutes for my battery tried a little bit and wasn't even charged 100% and I finished recording a second video I'm gonna roll today and then look at the time it's like 7:30 I didn't eat nothing if you're in the stall but I got this training them on about the bus this thing a little cuz I can't breathe anymore and I gotta bake some food I did I have some turkey burgers I made them last night or I like molded them seasoned them I had one yesterday this was already gonna be the plan for me to eat today but not at 7:30 I don't like eating past 6:00 a pop usually so this is a push for me but that's alright because I I have a productive day so I'm gonna let this slide so I'm gonna prop me up this burger cheese burger real quick and french fries and bless this food down because I'm spark okay starving Happy Easter hi I need to go solve it only thing that's gonna suck tonight is I gotta take this makeup off I have it take it off makeup and I got a free brain my hair that's what they I don't this okay I'm such a girly girl yes I am but the maintenance to retwist this and I'm gonna retwist it cuz just in case I think of another video idea I'm gonna keep this makeup on until after I eat and then if I think there's something else to record while I still got this beat on I'm gonna do it just so I could get it over with so so far I'm gonna have three videos go up not at the same time I'm gonna have a vlog I'm gonna have a get ready with me kind of like in talk about the world it was going on and then the third one is gonna be my top ten that's like pics so look out for those videos I told you I was on a roll today now about to fry me up this burger real good burgers in the oven right now I'm heating up the oil for my fries this is another thing I do not skimp on another thing I don't skimp on I like potato rolls don't come to me with that cheap bread that fall apart as soon as you put the hamburger on it it's not it's not gonna work for me I need these and I do and I was talking to my friend cat about this I need them to start selling this impacts those two or four I have two more burgers left imma used two other two burgers later next week and I'm gonna have full rolls left what am I gonna do with the other four rolls like why do they do that I don't need eight but I have no choice because they only sell it at eight and then I put two pieces of Muenster cheese on each side because you don't want cheese on one part of the burger and not on the other part like that just doesn't work so you don't we bout to hook this up right now check  the burger  all right so we got a quick little meal here cheeseburger season the fries and my iced tea I
