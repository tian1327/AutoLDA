  good morning so today is day 1 of working from home I don't have any makeup on and my hair is not brush but it's about six fifty five and five minutes I have to login so I thought I would document my experience my company decided to close down their office in downtown Chicago for the next two weeks until this coronavirus in Chicago hopefully flattens out our curve whatever the hell that means later but right now I just wanted to show you like what my first outfit of not going to work looks like so I have a hoodie that they gave me I'm covering it up here because it has a logo on it and sup hands and then a pair of Crocs not the cutest but I'm definitely comfortable and then usually I have a Dunkin coffee so I actually woke up like at 6:45 and I still got my Dunkin so I will be it'll be like a regular day for me I also don't have like a standard desk at my house look at my vanity I have my vanity but I don't have a computer desk with the computer chair that is as comfortable as my the one I have in my office but I am gonna use my dining room table for now and then maybe clear out my vanity later this week so yeah got my water got my coffee I'm gonna log in and try to do some work I'll check back in with you guys so it's been about two hours since I've started and Wow I look like a mess but yeah but I opened up my Cortinas my mom's curtain so she has in the living room and we're about two hours in my chef's been pretty good so yeah it's interesting working from home it's very quiet I think I'm gonna put some music on and continue to work but this has been my setup so far so I have just my phone some laptop 'wipeys a banana my purse and Jesus so it's about noon and I did a little bit of work very good productive morning still don't have any makeup on because I just what's the point but now I'm gonna buy oh now I'm about to go on lunch at noon and I think I'm gonna run to the store and he guys for my car I get a 45 minute lunch so we'll see how productive we are so I'm gonna run out and get some stuff either way I still need some things like laundry detergent and just other little things so I have my list and I might bring new guys with me but yeah that's the plan I'm just waiting to clock out and tell my team then I won't be online for the next 45 minutes but yeah so far working from home has been good there was a little moment where the girl downstairs I'm assuming she didn't have class because I think CPS might have closed here in Chicago or they're doing online and she was a little bit loud but I did do one call and I didn't sound like it was too disruptive but I like to work quietly anyways I had a candle going music on low so so if I'm loving working from home honestly it's I'm very thankful that makes my company was able to do that and yeah
