 hi everyone right now I'm in my dorm I've been here alone for like a week right now when I'm filming this it's like in the midst of all the corona stuff happening and everyone at my college was ordered to like move out and go home except I'm from New York and my schools in California so it's not that easy for me so I'm still chilling here until I can figure out how I'm gonna move out and go home definitely enjoy myself I'm literally the only person here I do be social distancing without even trying cuz there's just no one here so I figured in these last days in my freshman dorm room I'm gonna make a video that's just like a day in my life while in quarantine just kidding um this semester ended so early I never got a chance to do like a dorm tour or like enough day in my life College videos so I figured I'd pack all of it into one video right now am i standing still so I just woke up let's say our breakfast shall we let's do I got in the fridge there's a bit of a juice left over from pressed juice tree that I got like a week ago that definitely does not taste like it did last week um if you're wondering this is an apple pineapple lemon and mint juice oh I'm so sad let me just say what my experience here has been like you can watch my video that I just previously posted where I Delia princess Polly Hall but I talk about second semester in it and I'm like oh my god I'm so excited for this semester I can't wait to go to the beach to the beach the beach at the beach the beach that'd be I'm so happy the semesters like so much better than first semester I finally found like really good friends I just met a bunch of new people everything's just so much better like I'm so happy here oh my love being here and I say like over and over again cuz when I filmed that none of this had gotten like super crazy yet and then like as soon as I posted it in my school like shut down and then I was like Oh plans cancelled so it's been like a really sad two weeks personally and just like thinking about the world in general like I just think about all my friends and I won't see them again until August which was awful like I've been just crying for like two weeks straight but then also like to think about everyone else that's being affected by this it's so bad obviously everyone's allowed to be sad about their own personal losses but like we need to remember that there are people in like way worse situations right now so do your part as an individual don't go to public places wash your hands please just be considerate it's honestly crazy like I did not know I could cried this much like I was so excited for like everything that was happening here and like the people I met and the things I had going on ah and I lose this room I love this room if you guys watched my previous video I talked about how my new roommate has an emotional support dog who is like the sweetest little puppy named Ziggy she just moved in and now she's leaving and it was like so much fun having her and Ziggy here and now they have to move out anyways none of this is about me I think I'm gonna go fill up my water outside my dorm and then we can get going my day we ran outside good morning Chapman University how are we on this wonderful day I'm just walking to the nearest water station on my campus crazy I can just film here cuz there's literally no one the freedom I have oh it's so pretty here I'm gonna miss it so much look at like what the heck we're on our way the weirdest part about all this is how there's no closure it's such an important year of my life everyone just had to dip immediately I didn't even get to process anything and they went to shower now   out of the shower now in case you guys were wondering what shampoo and conditioner I use I use function of do you need I've been in there for a while me and Ashley both have my sister if you don't know functional beauty is its custom shampoo and conditioner made just for you based off a little two-minute quiz you take online you just fill out your hair goals and your preferences and you get to choose like the color and fragrance and everything which is super fun they don't use any parabens or sulfates GMOs toxins all that and it's 100% vegan and cruelty-free which is right up my alley so yeah they're really good quality and you can customize to put your name on it so mine says like function of amber as you can see and they have other products too like I this little hair mask that I use like once a week and it just keeps my hair nice and hydrated so yeah function beauty's been working so well for me for the past like probably like eight months it's like the only shampoo conditioner that's actually made like a substantial difference in my hair because I was able to customize and I want my formula to like enhance my curls and lessen my frizz so yeah my hair still works I like just got out of the shower but their products have held my hair so much because yeah I shouldn't try out function beauty could link in my description you can get 20% off your first order anyways I'm filling my hair air-dry and I'm gonna starts with my homework now hi everyone do you notice anything different now my roommate just came back and fully moved out now I'm all alone I'm just kidding I was already alone she just stopped by for like an hour to pack for 7:00 leave another room so empty I'm losing my mind you guys want see something funny look how and I'll show you what my size room looks like this is totally fine anyways updates 6 p.m. I've just been seeing my dorm all day eating dim mints and vegan fruit snacks and writing my 6 page paper that's due tomorrow should I do a dorm tour cuz I never got to do one I'm going to very quickly clean up my room and then do a dorm tour oh there are two houses let's start the dorm tour this is so sad I was so looking forward to actually doing a real donor card but this is the closest we're getting so let's start out here Lucia I start in the hallway hi guys here's my door because I'm moving out so soon I'll expose where I live if you know anything about Chapman are you interesting going to Chapman I lived in glass Hall this year room 305 I got the corner room which is really fun as you can tell this is the very end : of the hallway and because I had a corner room that means 2 1 biggest rooms in this dorm so let's enter it so this is a view as soon as you walk in obviously very weird right now so start with the door shall we so here on the door we have this little roommate schedule that I drew up it had all three of our schedules like mixed on to it so that we would know when everyone's in class or like when the room would be empty Lola all that stuff next to it we have some hooks then trash and recycling mini fridge just has some nice little junk in it this mini fridge was especially tiny so I never really had that much stuff in there then we have our microwave then we have Katelyn space so this first bed is where Kaitlin was I put my clothes there cuz I'm trying to organize all my stuff when I'm packing so she had her desk then there was the closet that her and Ella shared her bed whatever then we have Ella's space this was her desk that was her bed there's the a/c right here and the nice pretty window above it it looked out onto the common area for glass as you can see there's like some benches in there it was really pretty so yeah this was Ella's bed and then across from her bed you go into deep bathroom very fun those are my things up there this was our shower this toilet has overflowed multiple times it was so awesome and I loved every second of it then we go out and it's my space so if you watched my video when I was moving in you'd know that I got here first so of course I picked the nice little corner bed so I just have these nice Jersey cotton bedsheets they're like t-shirt material so they're really stretchy and fun then I have this little orange throw blank on top of it my pillows a hoodie and this is the greatest investment I've ever made in my life this is my little toy bear named dog because at home I have a dog named bear so here I have a bear named dog and it's this giant toy there's a picture of Andrew hugging and we first bought it and it's so funny but yeah it's like the perfect size he's huge and I spin him every night he's from the store mini sale life it's like a Asian sort I think this is only like 12 or 15 dollars like it was really cheap for like the size that it is and I love him so much he keeps me company here then I have some nice pictures on my wall some flowers I have hanging those string lights I'll turn on see ya that's what that looks like when they're all nice and setup then we have the desk and I'm not gonna go that close cuz it's like the messiest it's ever looked I'll show you how I organized the drawers first drawer is essentially a junk drawer it has a bunch of my printed film photos my negatives and stuff like that random boxes then we have this drawer which is all like bathroom type stuff and like vitamins electrolytes neurology this knife I use for everything then down here is my favorite drawer it's so loud such a mess right now this is my snack drawer I will tell you my key snacks to have in the college dorm so basically what I lived off of this year was peanut bar Ritz crackers Annie's vegan fruit snacks complete cookies they're like vegan protein cookies nacho hippies baked Lay's chips and I also had a lot of hummus and stuff like that also my school has a cafeteria I call it the CAF so that would provide dinner every night but then sometimes it was bad obviously I'm vegan the options were not the best so a lot of times like me and my friends we go to like Taco Bell and stuff like that so funny and also I went to Jamba Juice on campus a lot and like Einsteins and Qdoba anyways moving on the tool here I have something inspiring notes AHA don't watch me closely one of them is a card from Ashley here's my closet there's two closets in my room which is not common for Chapman usually they would give everyone one really long big closet with no doors when said they gave us two closets that have doors covering them that's the bigger one so Ella and Caitlyn shared that one and this is the smaller closet so I got it to myself I have way too many clothes a bunch of junk up there I think that box has all my bathing suits dirty laundry ha ha ha it's fine I guess I'll go over this stuff now I just realize I skipped all of it this blue rug is from Ashley's apartment back when she had it I just brought it over here and when Ziggy our little puppy was here he used to love to sit on it then on my bedside stand I have I don't know why I have this year but I have my belt lip balm hand cream hair ties water then this shelf was old textbooks I don't know why they're there and then here I have my reusable bags for groceries sunscreen and my vitamins then we move to these drawers so this first drawer is my like bras and underwear and socks and stuff this one's all of my long-sleeve shirts and then this one's like my athletic wear then the bigger drawers this top drawer is all of my short sleeve shirts this shirt super cool my friend Charlie Prince his own shirts so I bought one from whom this has the Kardashians on it then I have an Alex G shirt because Alex she's my favorite artist then I just have like other random thrifted shirts then this drawer has all of my pants and bottoms so I've owned my denim random other types of pants my skirts back here then this bottom drawer is the most jam-packed this is all of my hoodies sweatshirts and then so most of my thrifted this one's my merch I'll have a link to it in the description ahaha I was wearing earlier to the grey version I have some Chapman hoodies on my leggings and I have an Alex G sweatshirt that Ashley got me for Christmas a bunch of stuff in there oh I have this window here which is so nice cuz I do be valuing some natural light it looks straight out into orange high school there anything else on my desk that's important I have my keys here I my film camera here I carried this everywhere when I bought on eBay it came in this little bag so I just carry that little bag everywhere I use a Pentax IQ zoom 115v but I have a whole video about film on my channel if you want to check that video out I said I gotta say my color scheme I'm still a big fan of it I love burnt orange and like a lot of white and then some green and stuff like that so yeah I think that concludes the dorm tour section of this video I'm so sorry it was done like this so sad anyways I think now I'm gonna make some soup in my dorm while I do big homework I got my vegan soup carrot and ginger  soup done alright hey ginger why do I buy that when it clearly says the primary flavors like carrot ginger why don't you this I'm not so foolish I just have really an idea because I'm trapped in this room I'm gonna have my desk be the relaxing desk I'll sit there when I go on tape talking stuff like that Ella's desk will be my eating desk and then Caitlyn's desk over there will be my homework desk this is awesome I will be so productive and I'll have like divisions of space and I'll function so much better I am a genius so right now just an email soup and I'm gonna eat it with some hippies and my water heeey hi everyone it's 10 p.m. I'm still doing homework okay so now I'm gonna make another food cauliflower mac and cheese is vegan my dinner my dinner my dinner my dinner my dinner my dinner homework by now almost 3 a.m. I just finished my paper that was do not a very eventful day but this is one day and my quarantined life looks like at college tomorrow morning my mom flies in and she's gonna help me pack up and leave this weekend so now I'm just gonna head to bed and I'm gonna continue this video into tomorrow and like the rest of this weekend where I move out I probably won't film too much because it's gonna be like chaos I'll see you tomorrow morning when I pick up my mom from the airport hello everyone is the nice day we just got the storage unit that we're gonna store my car and all my belongings in over the summer I'm kind of losing my mind or having a good time so we're gonna keep on packing  I just realized something so weird I was like digging in my drawers there's a letter here that says open once you finish your freshman year I wrote this on my own in my dorm room but in my orientation group we wrote like actual letters and our oels our orientation leaders were supposed to deliver it to us at the end of our freshman year but now that we're all like moving out of here we're never gonna get them and I wrote like really good stuff in mine I don't remember what exactly I just know that it was like super good and now I only have like this crappy version but like hopefully this is enough - like filming that's so weird I want my other one I'm not gonna read out loud I'll read it yeah I'm gonna read this out like there's nothing that personal in it hello it is Friday August 23rd 2019 which i think is the last day of orientation family left last night I feel good I love orientation I think he will look back at this time and wish you could feel it all again I've met so many cool people people here are awesome it might take a while to make friends but I know they are here that's where I smile that when I read it the first time I'm excited to get into a routine I hope I can really get on top of my sheet I feel very comfortable here I hope I make good friends to make it more fun I hope I'm productive with working on YouTube and film / TV stuff I am excited here that's so funny my second letter I wrote was like wild it was like a full loose leaf paper from back I think orientation week was like one of the happiest times my life you can watch my video where I moved across country shows all my orientation stuff I think already said that earlier but like that videos there and I was like so happy during that time and the letter I wrote was so happy I might want to like DMI oels I'm friends with them on Instagram there's no way they could ever get it to us dang it that's so sad one of them probably has my very personal intimate letter somewhere in the bottom of one of their cabinets or something at least I had this one there's always kind of bland though I got to say here was my name card during orientation week I can't believe I found that what like a weird dramatic way to find Italy I was literally moving out and entirely forgot until I just picked this up anyways I'm gonna keep I'm packing all my stuff this packs away so I think we're gonna move some stuff into my car right now and then tomorrow we're gonna do most moving into the storage unit so I'll probably see you tomorrow hi it's our last day of moving out and the dorm is fully empty right now I'm gonna remake the first clip of me moving in in August watch this hello
