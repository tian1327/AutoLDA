   hello everybody this is Kelly stamps I miss blogging I miss going outside I miss involving strangers in my shenanigans I kind of what you know it's just keeping me down keeping a sister down and to be honest with you many of us YouTube creators don't know what we're supposed to upload right now I've turned to youtube and do my part-time job here in my isolation so I thought why not give the Stampede what they deserve give them another vlog just this is gonna be a day of my life in quarantine vlog action here we are welcome hello everybody - sky stamps I have risen I have risen from the ashes of my sleep I wake up promptly at seven o'clock or 7:01 usually every morning without an alarm why because I'm crazy I just think earth is so peaceful and beautiful when you just hear the birds chirping and it's still a pretty dark out now it's ten o'clock but I did wake up at 7 and I did already brush my teeth so don't think I'm nasty I'm messy but not nasty well I am nasty but I can't talk about that because YouTube guidelines alright so I'm gonna open up my laptop I have to put my password in okay we're in Oh that window okay hi we're on YouTube studio right now I'm looking at my analytics for my last video titled I blew up on YouTube and it changed my life it's doing very well it obviously as of right now it has sixty eight point five thousand views and I knew it would get a lot of views because people want to live the American dream which isn't necessarily going to college and getting a full-time job in buying a house anymore it is becoming a youtuber according to a bunch of children all across the world I usually spend 45 minutes or so every other morning just looking at my analytics seeing how I'm doing a lot of people click on my videos when they get recommended it's just they can't get enough of mine is a Booma foo stare my blink expression and my monotone voice I'm gonna check my business email now okay I just want to share something with you all in case you didn't watch my bag review of that purse which a lot of people didn't because who cares about first um I mentioned in the beginning that somebody named Christopher motley sent me an eat alii gift cards so Christopher if you're watching let me show you this man Christopher motley sent me a $100 gift card to eataly you know what I did the same day in the video if you go watch the video on the purse I actually took my purse or a full-on suit went to eat away and spent about thirty dollars on it I got tiramisu some shrimps shrimps some scraps and pasta because of Christopher I now have a $100 Eataly gift card oh and excuse my clothing situation right now the top is from muji I love it but the shorts these are actually not shorts they're fleece lined leggings which are from a figure-skating brand or serious athlete it's like myself I don't own any lounge shorts for some reason I don't feel like buying any I'm happy to spend $200 on a meal but if it comes to me just spending ten bucks on a pair of shorts at t.j.maxx I'm like hold up ooh okay something exciting I just got an email from YouTube my subscriber plaque my 100,000 striper plaque is coming it is on its way it will be here in two to three weeks so stay tuned for that unboxing it's way more useful but a college degree okay so I finished checking my analytics on YouTube and checked my business email and my personal email as if people actually email me nobody emails me I got excited because I saw the little red one I thought yes yes somebody wants to talk to me it was just chase calm letting me know that my credit card payment is due alright so I'm gonna close my computer now I don't know why I'm saying everything I'm doing that's weird it's a weird habit no I think YouTube people do it they're like okay guys so now I'm gonna take my glasses off I'm going to now drink some of this it's like you you see what I'm doing I don't have to say that this is my very serious adult planner which I will have when I am president as well I get them from the Japanese market called Sunday today is the 10th for the cent that says film video that's what I'm doing so I'm filming a video I also have some goals here it says goal make $3,000 this month which is easy and that says make 5 videos they should all be greater than or equal to fifteen minutes long not just because it's great for the algorithm like I don't need to care at this point because I have a strong following but it's that I want to make less videos that are longer and better quality last month I was just pushing out videos because people are bored and Quarantine and so I but the quality was declining because I was taking on way too many sponsored videos and I don't really care about this company it's the only company that I really care about is yes style the Asian fashion retailer because they're super good to me and we have a commission program going on together so thanks to those who actually bought clothes from that video because I have a bad Commission now I can't turn the credit the commission credit into money or I can use it for future purchases so it's a win-win situation I will always work with yet style yes now that I have over 100,000 subscribers I would like to start off new a fresh start to my channel so here is my Muji notepad this is where I keep all of my video notes I'm literally write essays every single week and I just make them come to life and I turn them into videos this is a new start for my channel I actually wrote the words new start because it's okay to change up your channel you know it doesn't have to stay the same thing and what I'm experiencing is you know times are a-changin clearly you we don't know what's going on in this world and I think it's silly to have to stick to one theme your entire life for your channel I do have five distinct playlists now there is inspirational stamps Kellie's passport stamps feminine stamps toys food stamps and won't understand stop support my goal today is to write out some Theo ideas for the rest of the year but they will still relate to the main theme of my channel which is being okay with introversion independence and adulting basically I have a chaotic good lifestyle at least I'm told I just do whatever I want I want with my struggle bangs some thinking of doing some sort of a intellectual discussion on the pursuit of happiness when you're in your twenties like what is success what makes you happy is it going to school and getting a job which is what society tells us to do or is it pursuing your own interests because that's what I'm going through and my channel is always going to reflect what I'm currently going through it's not going to be it's going to change and somebody mentioned in the beginning of my channel it was different it was more like loud expressive I was trying to be something I wasn't which is just more extroverted and wild this is probably boring to listen to if you're still listening at this point right the word platypus in the comments    hello it is time for me to fulfill my weekly pasta addiction I'm going to go and post meats alright that's on its way I'm going to take a shower because I love showering so much fun is I have a little concert in the shower hello what's up everybody I just took a shower and I covered my entire body in coconut oil as usual because I like to be a big ol Brown greased up cookie ready to go in the preheated oven this is my outfit of the day I'm wearing my Handmaid's Tale looking hasn't taught and I have my mask because I'm gonna go on a walk don't come at me please just kidding you can because it's YouTube you can say whatever you want I'm not here to censor you      oh my god I love you I love you I love you  you
