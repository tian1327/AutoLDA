 welcome to my life in quarantine March 2024 hello darlings welcome to my first monthly vlog it is March 14 happy pi day 3.14 it's also national potato chip day as you may already know I'm based in Washington and because of the thing that must not be named I heard that if you say the infamous c-word and YouTube videos if you get demonetized and you know what making videos is a lot of work so I don't want to make this demonetized so I'm going to avoid that c-word but if I say C word that's that's this is what it means if you watch some other videos you know by now that I will not be traveling internationally the next few months I do have a backlog of travel videos from the past year but if only just upload those I'm gonna run out of content so I'm gonna be doing these monthly vlogs and share are the things aside from food and travel and you know there's been changes in my personal life things I want to incorporate more into this channel so I'm thinking doing these monthly vlogs is a great way to introduce those things something smells really good I love your hair mommy oh what did you put in it sorry gonna try the meandering Hill tiniest olive oil so um maybe I have no reason to be putting makeup on or getting dressed originally I was gonna go to my friend's birthday bonfire but you know Washington we got the break out of the c-word so we just decided to stay home dressed up with nowhere to go but even so dressing up versus not dressing up makes you feel a little different makes things feel special dinnertime salmon over sliced cabbage while eating I'm gonna read this graphic novel never heard about it before it just went into the library randomly walk to a section and pick some comic books up I rarely read comic books these days but I like to change things up once in a while  this used to be so easy to play but now I'm like looking at some notes I'm like where is that I am in desperate need of a musical GPS and the music world these hashtags are called sharps so I've been thinking since we're gonna be staying home a lot because of the C word what are some things to do now I'm a homebody but like while I love to travel I also love to stay at home although staying at home for like 10 days straight which have a ton before does make me get a little antsy you know cabin fever what are some things you guys are planning to do while we are in self quarantine I'm thinking maybe I'll master this song moonlight it's by it Ludwig van Beethoven also it's been a hot minute since I've done some weaving I have a smaller loom which if I just sit down and focus I could finish it one tapestry in about 3-4 hours if I don't care about the design it's like super fast but if I'm like thinking about the design the colors and textures then it takes me a while but that's the fun of it designing so I'm going to do some weaving again other things to help has time board games behind the TV we have a jigsaw puzzle thousand-piece puzzle got it at Goodwill a couple months ago Snow White and the Seven Dwarves theme it's really cool because it looks like it's a book for the rest of the day I'm gonna be editing videos and take plenty of breaks my butt and my legs fall asleep so easily just found out that the yoga studio I used to go to in California they're hosting live yoga classes in the duck / cabbage salad with soaked walnuts happy Friday not that I'm going out transcoding my video files my daily breakfast includes avocados with strawberry blueberry and raspberry finish episode two of containment highly successful people would probably advise against Netflix thing in the morning but I'm a Red Bull normally I don't watch Netflix in the morning but so what if I do video files still transcoded I'm gonna be doing yoga with adriene on YouTube breathe in breathe out breathe in breathe out ha ha doink doink doink doink mommio cut up the grape for the skin and let them dry this one is orange whoo I could smell it from here I like to

word rare do you know Selena Gomez yeah you know something ago vez yeah singer did you know her album name is rare I just got rid of two E's and an A and look what happened mom I have three eyes in three E's and one you   listening to the podcast called guide to happiness this episode is about six ways to build your resilience it's quite a large loom and today I added about 20 lines I did a Bab pattern with this light gray blue and white for this piece I don't have a set design in mind I'm just going with the flow after putting some lines then I look at it and think I think this color will go really well next or this texture so here are some pieces I finished a couple months ago this one I put in like an abstract Sun it's in triangles this one I had a lot of fun making it also has a Sun but with softer thread I put three pom-poms and made the pom-poms from scratch okay good night to you sweet dreams finally out of the house to go grocery shopping the rice and beans are nearly sold out what sorcery is this I can't believe my eyes there's actually toilet paper it doesn't matter what goes on in the world flowers just bloom as if there's no pandemic I'm gonna edit videos for the next few hours and then at 6:00 there's another online yoga class all the yoga class is up until this point they're hosted by teachers from breathe together yoga when I lived in San Jose that's the studio I always went to regularly this is my favorite studio of all time so it's so awesome to be learning from these teachers again from the convenience is my home I don't need to drive anywhere I just boom go to the mat and start practicing if you guys want to learn with me I'll put the link in the description box no this is not sponsored I'm just supporting breathe together studio a lot of businesses right now are closed because of the quarantine so while the yoga studios and fitness studios are closed we can still support them somehow one of the ways is if they're hosting online classes like this you could donate money to help keep their business afloat so I donated some money to my yoga studio you're just doing it what you can and help keep businesses alive doing yin yoga with Lindsey what is that Mommy Oh tofu kimchi nunchaku massage and the protein is sardine I feel lighter now my body feels more awake it is Monday morning and I am ready for some video editing hardcore video editing the past few days I've been using Netflix as a way to escape but the funny thing is we're quarantine ourselves from the virus but containment is about virus thing quarantine II so it's not really escaping from reality I guess so today one of my missions is replace Netflix with master class you guys heard about master class it has come a long way I remember the time when I first joined the master class they had only two courses and I was taking one with Jim Patterson but now there's so many courses things with filmmaking making music I need to binge more on master class instead of Netflix lunchtime and master class David Lynch almost 9:00 p.m. and I'm done editing for the day I'm gonna spend time with Mr loom gonna weave about ten lines and while I'm weaving I'm gonna listen to a podcast hosted by Life kit this episodes on making art is good for your health here's how to start a habit there are weeks where I'm really good at balancing out my life and having art weaving or drawing be part of my daily life the past few weeks I've been editing a lot more than usual because the videos recently have been really long thus these days I've been having a hard time weaving every day we're doing something creative other than the digital world I'm looking forward to getting some ideas on how to make art my daily life no matter how busy I get with work feels like a little pet interesting there's an episode on how to have a good weekend thinking to add some pom-poms I think tomorrow we will make a family of pom-poms  makes like skip this one  finished editing a video and also did some other work and my eyes are feeling really tired thankfully it is time for you and yoga  it's currently 9:40 and I'm gonna make some pom-poms for my weave I'm gonna listen to NPR shortwave it's okay to sleep late but do it for your immune system they look familiar don't they like seed heads appetizer appetizer number two they I wrote and recorded voice mom you and I playing Scrabble and look at the situation again I have all bowels and mama yo has four consonants so basically we have the same problem but with different letters what board games does your family like to play let us know in the comment section and also what are some good board games for two players  15:1 is start here start while like as a guru in attendance   by everyone and recover well good fuel story today that workout was live-streamed by Kevin Bey Oh who is my besties brother he has big arms he won some bodybuilding competitions before he trains people but right now because of the quarantine he is doing live stream training there is about two at six seven other people in that group chat and he was just keeping us accounted if we took too long a break you play hey what are you doing oh my oh my Wow I finally finished are they oh this video is almost 30 minutes long and it took me a really long time to edit I feel a little bit closer to burning out so now I'm gonna do some yoga I should take a selfie from this angle and put it on tinder  it probably looks like I do yoga all the time or something fun or something relaxing but most of the day I'm just on the computer but nobody wants to watch a person staring at a computer screen all day do they it's Friday night and I am excited to show party in the tub yesterday I didn't shower the thing is more people are washing their hands now and for longer it's recommended to wash your hands for 20 seconds but when you're rubbing your hands with the soap you got to turn the faucet off if you have the water running that's wasting water but I'm guessing there's gonna be a lot of people who are gonna have the water running for 20 seconds and it makes me conscious of how much more water we're using right now so if I'm at home all day then I'll skip every other day to shower but actually personally I do like to shower every day I might just feel dirty if I don't shower even for one night but anyhow I'm gonna shower today and it's gonna be great happy Caturday Saturday I finished the David Lynch series on masterclass and now we're gonna start the Ken Burns I've been watching a little bit of master class every time I eat and now I'm gonna have some breakfast already had my berries in avocado course two is great and free bread and cauliflower rice  it's raining and the crickets are singing its mother nature's lullaby I don't have a tune up bolso okay here's spool of yarn so this is not exactly fitness equipment but we just gotta use what we have  together  because I've been quarantined for days can't even remember the last time I loved the house maybe ten days I don't know I'm noticing that my productivity level is dropping so the speed I usually edit my videos it's way slower usually what I do is I go work out to my studio and then come back and work some more and I feel like reenergized I really miss doing cardio and meeting up with my new friends I mean I recently moved to Washington so I'm finally like making my community and then BOOM social distancing what I've been doing is instead of like forcing myself to keep editing when I feel like that sluggishness falling in I'm taking breaks to re-energize myself typically when I leave I do it at night but I'm thinking why wait until night why not do a little bit of weaving throughout the day while I take a break I got my pom-poms in and have these big spools of macrame this is the thinnest one so I put a couple lines over here and then there's a slightly thick one over here I'm adding that as well and finally the thickest one I'm gonna put over here during this quarantine period do you guys feel like your productivity level is dropping as well do you notice other psychological and physical changes I definitely am feeling it on all kinds of levels here's the thing when the quarantine is done and over with how am I gonna feel when I step out of that house you definitely I'll be excited but then like how am I gonna feel about myself and I be gonna be like I became the worst version of myself by staying at home all day or is it gonna be I did the best I can in that situation and I actually grew as a person I became a better person now physically I might not be as fit by the time this quarantine is over but mentally or like spiritually did I grow did I learn something from this experience can it be proud and see I did my best or is it just gonna be I only did Netflix you know there's some cool stuff on Netflix but it's good to have a diversity of activities not just Netflix not just watching media like I feel different when I just watch Netflix versus reading a book or like extra sizing it's good to have a balance because I do love my Netflix and that's okay the great thing about Netflix and books it transport you somewhere else so yeah like we might not be able to hop on a plane and travel freely without worry but at home through your mind you can travel go somewhere else into worlds of fantasy or whatever world do you want to enter somehow it's already the last day of March how did that happen just like most months this month went by really fast yet also very slow there just being at home all day every day the days start to blur they all feel the same you just working on the computer watching some Netflix video chat with friends glowing screen after glowing screen I wanted to do some reflection just being at home and not exercising as I normally do I feel slower I'm having lower motivation I'm concerned I'm gonna have consecutive days where I just don't want to get out of bed couple months ago I overcame that it was symptoms of depression I am a bit wary that those symptoms are gonna come back I know I'm not the only one going through a bit of a tough time there's a lot of people out there going through even harsher times than me but everyone is affected by what's going on right now on varying levels and diverse ways whenever I feel poopy I think about the people out there everyone as a human collective it's not just me who's suffering it's not just you who's suffering it's all of us going through this together and during this suffering there are always moments of joy and we could always practice gratitude in ways that we can and I'm so thankful that a lot of us are practicing social distancing and doing what we can on our part so in the past few days I was thinking how can I make the best April I can out of this situation what can I do and then when the end of April comes do I really want to have the same conversation about oh I watched too much Netflix again oh I feel even more lorem evasion I feel even slower than last month do I really want to go down that path no I don't think anybody wants to I think everyone wants to have a great feeling amazing feeling when they step by the house after this is all over so next one I've got a plan stay tuned for the April vlog before I end this video I have a question for you have you developed a quarantine routine what are your favorite things to do at home what are some ways that you've become a better version of yourself what's something that you've been working on let us know in the comment section I wish you all health safety and Happiness during this time remember to subscribe and hit that notification bell for food and travel in Korea check out my other channel sweet and tasty TV toodles maan noodles  one thing I've gotten good at is no matter how busy I am I always journal every night it was not easy to build that habit but I finally have it as a habit now I just realized something the difference between how I journal in my life and do art the thing about journaling I don't tell myself I'm gonna set aside one whole hour or just write indefinitely I tell myself I'm gonna write one page so it feels very doable you just need maybe 5-10 minutes just as I do with one page a day in my journal I'll do like 10 lines for my weave instead of being like I'm gonna try to finish his weave today or like I'm gonna try to finish this notebook today do manageable bits to make it into a daily habit at 10 lines per day on this totally doable I made quite a thick band here from this yarn thinking to add some pom-poms my goal was to do 10 lines but I ended up doing more like 20 and because my goal was quite small and he did double I feel very accomplished whereas if I said I'm gonna do as much as I can and I still wouldn't reach that top not even halfway and then I'd be like oh I didn't do much so if there's something you want to do every day set a number if it's writing maybe you do one sentence or one page if it's doing art maybe you do one page of drawing or it depends how complex it is but in terms of weaving you combine lines don't make it a huge goal make it small but doable and then when you do more its bonus  today I deleted over 15 internet tabs and I say that with great pride because it's not easy just to close out a tab sometimes it's a journey you've got to watch 15 minutes of a video to close that tab other times you got to read an article here like I need to know more about this thing sometimes you're like is this very important no but I must see it I must watch it sometimes you might think something is not so important but later on that little piece of knowledge just might come in handy you just don't know so if you're interested in something you want to read about it you want to watch something about it you just want to learn more about it why not get into it sometimes what is practical what is logical is not always the right thing sometimes you just gotta go with your gut instinct you know
