  first time out and like literally a week grabbing some food there's like nobody in this part this is this Plaza is like the emptiest I've ever seen it like truly  so we got our food we're just gonna eat in the car because there we can't go into any of the restaurants and I think a lot of the restaurants are on a to go only a policy at this point so it's gonna be kind of hard to like navigate how to eat this I'm I guess I get to get home but we have a lot of late errands to run anyway so I'll have to deal Oh hey everyone it's though I think it's been about a good two weeks since my last quarantine update Wow what two weeks it has been spit theory right home people in house not gonna lie it's pretty scary seeing all these shelves pretty empty I don't I'm kind of really like grasp the magnitude of this because literally everything's empty parently they're giving out these bags for free because they think it's safer than bringing your own bags in hey oh my god I just finished shopping at Target it's a gloriously beautiful day it's not too hot it's not too cold I had this huge fear of like going outside but now that I'm outside it's okay like I think we just need to get over fear and just go outside sweating though I try so good I don't know why I'm like sweating like a pig right now so out of breath there's one more pit stop making up for all the errands I didn't get to do well in quarantine let's go   you so currently a target to shop for some school lunches so we can assemble them for nonprofits thing that they're doing or they're trying to feed or they're trying to get 1,000 food damn it okay we found the Capri Sun Ayala now where is that's the 3000 man I don't want the 30 pack good oh my god one I mean there's a bread right here but different lighter bread  and no idea that market had these brown bags that you can use so amazing there's why I got so far free snacks bread capri-sun butter weird ice cube things life is basically yeah bullying from inside the house to Target back inside the house to a target so what's up I'm Alex from hikes we are doing a sack lunch program right now because everyone's staying in indoors we're asking people to make lunches at home and then we're gonna pick them up and deliver them to unhoused neighbors especially people who are normally serviced by like churches and other organizations who are closed right now because of safer at home we're trying to make sure they get their food so thank you too so yeah we're reaching 2,000 meals this month that's our goal a little bit it's your partnership with Paula's pantry Melissa a sedara Poulos pantry and then Covenant House is one of the organizations were partnering up with to get Neil one house young people cool thank you        that's how good that looks time to mix it  so I don't like this every day but I take a pretty long time to make breakfast so I'll make sure that it is like the biggest meal that I'm gonna have for the rest of the day only because I don't know why I've been like hankering for a breakfast dude all night and so I'm really excited to wake up in the morning and make breakfast I'm always thinking about like what should I make my usual go-to is our potatoes potato skillet I guess this is what it's called I've been making those Korean Street sandwiches with the coleslaw and sugar and this guac is amazing I've been currently reading the artists way I think this is an essential book for all artists it's a workshop book where they basically dig deep into your soul and make you uncover all your insecurities what you worry about what you're scared of as an artist and it kind of brings to light what those things are whether there are roadblocks to your creativity what you can improve on and just like how to be a better human being and listener and person so it has been a full years since I've started but I have not been able to finish like it's just so hard to even open it and start reading and then doing all the exercises but I thought today be a good date is start that I thought I'm like this I look like a monk or something it's very chilly yeah but it's really cool I really like all what this Julia Cameron is the author and she really taps into how we behave as artists and why we procrastinate and our sphere to do certain things and things like that like I said I've been at this book for a year and I'm only a week seven I'm going to eight weeks are there you're supposed to technically do one week every week so I see all right you're obviously supposed to do this in consecutive weeks but it's also kind of hard cuz you have to confront a lot of your feelings and have to start the exercise you're like okay here we go again so sometimes a lot but it's been nice yeah
