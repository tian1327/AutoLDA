 good morning everyone it is Friday March 20th 2020 it has been a week now since I have been a social distancing or self away and been getting a lot of stuff done but it's been a lot of the same randomness I have eight thousand or I had over eight thousand photos and videos on this phone one of my goals was to transfer them to my hard drive so I can free up some space they've got like 64 gigs of space on my phone and it was up to like 59 gigs so I was like I need to do something I need to get these transferred over oh that's what I'm in the process of doing every day yeah yesterday I really didn't do much of anything today is gonna be a little bit more productive I'm eating breakfast right now it's a frozen strawberries and bananas that I put in a blender with a spoonful of peanut butter and just a little dash of almond milk and blend it all up and then put it in the bowl and then it put some granola and fresh raspberries on top so yeah it should be very very delicious I'm excited for it that's what I love about having a place that I can cook or prep food because I can buy stuff for meals that I'm just like really excited about and that way it's kind of a motivation to get up in the morning like my number-one motivation is usually that I have to pee after that I get excited when I think about you know breakfast and stuff I think I excited about lunch and dinner it's nice to just to have little things like that throughout the day that I can get excited about I know you think that I like haven't showered since last week but I have I just I this is my favorite sweater I just live in it even when I'm not social distancing I wear this thing almost every day all right I'm gonna eat up my breakfast then I'm gonna get on to the photos and videos well I've already done the videos videos are done except for the last few videos from the vlogs that I need to transfer but and then I think I'm gonna do a little bit yard work and then I'm gonna go down to the park that's near us I climb a tree and read a book for a while and enjoy my artist date I will see you all in just a bit yeah I just did this meditation session with this app called sink tuition right now it's just the free version but I did it twice back-to-back like the first one the first time I spent imagining certain things that I want in my life and just walking through places and like just really feeling it the second time I tried to just control my thoughts and it was interesting the things that I came up but um yeah just my body feels so amazing yeah I contemplated taking about a 20 minute and a half just no because I'm like so depleted but like in a good way I don't think I'm gonna take a nap but I think I'm gonna lay here for just a like 10 minutes or so and just chill cuz hoo boy I felt good I can't wait to do this at night that's gonna be really nice to do at night right before I go to sleep boy I can't imagine what kind of nice sleep I'll get after that but yeah I want to check out I know there's plenty of like meditation sessions on YouTube as well some people have recommended some to me I have to go find them I still have to transfer some photos which I don't think will take me that long today and then go out and do some yard work and then I get to do my artist date so I'm excited for the rest of the day yeah it should be should be good times so due to everything going on with coronavirus and everything I think my landlord is a little panicked that she is not going to get her rent even though I have repeatedly told her that everything is good at least for the month of April so we devised a plan where I would do some yard work like an hour day for each hour that I worked she would take $20 off my rent so I figure I'll probably work like a good five days or so and get about $100 off my rent yeah why not I mean it benefits me because it's less that I have to ask my parents for an assistance and if we end up getting these checks then it'll benefit me as well because then you know I won't have to pay as much so yeah and as a beautiful day I hear and I've been stuck inside for the last few days so it's kind of nice to be outside and just listening to my Sokka station on Pandora of course what else would I use to get my energy levels up yeah after this I'm going to cook some lunch and then take a walk down to the park I just had to come on here really quick because I just found myself like village it just started crying I don't know is one of my favorite songs playing on Pandora and it's just so beautiful Zach today I just I've been doing all of this emotional work I just feel so happy I don't have any things I know we're stressing about having to work so much I don't have deadlines I don't have obligations and just it's great ponds boy I've never felt this happy I just wanted to share me good I'm usually always crying because I'm sad or angry or frustrated I think this is the first time ever that I've cried because I'm just so happy I'm just so happy in a situation that doesn't involve like feeling like I need to be loved from another person or getting that receiving that love from another person because that's the only other times that I've ever felt the genuinely happy but this time is different because this time it doesn't have to do with anybody but me I wonder how many other people are feeling this way how many other people are like tuning into themselves and just relaxing and realizing that life is so much more delicious shitty jobs that we have and all the stress that we take on alright I want to go back to being happy you get   so one of the things that I have to do for the artists way is to go on an artist date we have to do something by ourselves once a week that would excite our inner artist child so something that we used to do when we were younger that just brought us so much joy and it's just a way of reconnecting with that inner child and to eventually get to a point where you can explain that everything is going to be okay that you've got them that you know that they are going through so much and they're in a lot of pain and they're they're experiencing suffering for the you know either the first time in their lives or like ongoing suffering and yeah just letting them know that you're your adult self has them when other people or our parents or our friends abandon us or you know treat us like we're disposable or don't like us for certain reasons our adult self can you know just wrap our arms around our inner child   I won't lie today is the first day that I don't know what day it is I think it's some day yeah it's Sunday I'm just playing it's like five o'clock in the afternoon I haven't vlogged it in like two days because I've literally been doing the same thing every day just get up have breakfast started working on transferring some of these photos I wanted to get this first vlog edited today because that would be a week's worth of content but I'm just really not in the mood right now I've just been staring at the screen all day so I'm taking some time I just had some food and just gonna do some reading now and eventually obviously I'm not bored yet I still have at least 10 days left I think if things go well maybe maybe I can cram it into like 8 or 9 but we'll see of transferring my photos and then I have logs to edit I have books to read so there's still a lot more things on that to-do list and I would like to get caught up with before all this stuff I don't know nobody knows what our new reality is going to look like but it's just kind of flowing I don't even remember oh no I went out when did I go out Sunday no today is Sunday I'd went out Friday I think to the park yeah I'm not really sure oh this is gonna get fun the next couple of weeks hey good afternoon it is Monday March 23rd 2020 and it is my technically my tenth day of self-isolation since last Monday one week ago from today I've only left my my yard one time and that was when I went down to the park a few days ago for the most part I've just been stick in my room and just getting some stuff done but I think it's starting to hit me because today like I just I couldn't be productive at all it was just fighting me so hard I laid down to take like maybe a 30 45 minute nap and I ended up sleeping for I think over two hours and I just I was like I don't know if you've ever gotten into that state where you just like you just cannot wake up it's like your alarm goes off and you hit snooze so you hit end and it's just like physically impossible like your body won't move and your your your brain is like we're not done yet I don't know I've just been very anxious today like my body is kind of jittery and I think that's one of the things that led to me not really being able to be so productive hey I'm gonna go out and go to the grocery store because a lot of my food is running out yeah just restock for another week or so I don't know for some reason I like my body thinks that like I think one of the another reason I was anxious like my body feels like in three or four days time like this is all gonna be over and everything's gonna go you know I can go through dog walks again and I'm just like panic because I'm not anywhere close to being done with my projects that I want to be done with and I have to convince myself like no this is gonna go on for a while you know I think to all of my bills and everything will be taken care of for April but going into May I have no idea what's gonna happen update with the stimulus bill is that Democrats and Republicans are fighting back and forth because the Republicans are the ones who drafted the bill for the stimulus package and they put in the bill things regarding like bailouts to large corporations and banks and very little repercussions for companies if they receive aid money and then do stock buybacks yeah and then it basically was only giving regular people like a thousand-dollar check basically it just wasn't it was a bill for the corporations and billionaires and the wealthy and the elite surprise surprise yeah so they still haven't reached a deal it's been several days now they've gone back and forth the Republicans are trying to lie and tell everybody that the Democrats are holding up their money and all this kind of stuff and it's just like it's so ugly it's so frustrating and it's so like just mind-blowing that these are the people you all elected it's infuriating I hate the u.s. so much I wish on so many things that I was not here in this country for this pandemic that I was somewhere else because this country it's such a piece of but anyways let me get dress and head out to the store and I'll bring you guys along with me and we'll see what it looks like outside so I have to say it's a it's a really weird feeling never in my life have I left my house thinking that maybe going outside was a death sentence I don't want to be paranoid but think spreads fast I'm pretty sure my immune system and everything is pretty healthy but I have had some complications in my past so I'm not sure how they affect everything dealing with this virus it's weird to to like deliberately go out of my way to like get far away from people to to walk on the street instead of the sidewalk or so walk in the grass and try to create as as much space in between us as possible right now I'm at a stage we're not paranoid but I'm also a little bit more stressed than I was before just watching our whole government charade it's just it's scary you know if this whole thing wasn't scary enough and then having to watch them just quarrel like children on water to the grocery store  so it wasn't that bad actually the shelves were empty for things like rice and flour Oh tofu I can't find hopeful anywhere let me find out it's non vegans or vegetarians hoarding tofu let me find out I'm just kidding it's not that serious but I've been wanting tofu scramble for breakfast for so long now the only thing that I was affected by as they didn't have any strawberries or blueberries picks up where they did have organic strawberries what they were like people like ten dollars or something like that yeah or even smoothie was six I don't know I don't know six ten something like that but way too expensive for me so yeah I skipped on the strawberries and I got oranges instead to make really good smoothie bowls with frozen oranges and bananas  I'm is so good I love freezing fruits I usually either do like bananas and strawberries or this is the first time I've tried bananas and oranges so I cut them up put them in a ziploc bag put them in the freezer I just did this yesterday so I already frozen overnight break them apart into little chunks put them in a blender I had some vanilla almond milk or whatever type of milk you would like I prefer plant-based I usually add granola because it gives it like a bit of a nutty flavor and some crunch to it or you can just put the smoothie right into a cup then drink it if you want but I like to put the granola on top and then put some fresh sliced fruit or I like some sometimes I do blueberries or raspberries or something like that but I think I had um raspberries on there the other day but yeah it's just a very healthy breakfast and it's almost like ice cream so I can kind of trick my brain into thinking I'm eating ice cream for breakfast when actually I'm getting a lot of healthy nutrients so yeah it's a win-win  all right so update for today oh it's getting more and more fun as these days progress so I woke up to I guess either yesterday or the day before the governor I think of taxes some some guy in like a of course an older white man and in Texas in some position of power had commented that grandparents should be okay with dying for the economy so there's that and then we have the former CEO of Goldman Sachs tweeting that within a week or two or those that are the most likely to survive should start going back to work and then we have our president President Donald Trump saying that the same thing that soon all of this will be passed and now within about two weeks or so people can start opening their businesses again people can start going back to work we can get back to business as usual these people don't give a about our lives they don't care they don't care if we live they don't care if we die they never did and now it's more apparent than ever you know those of us have been paying attention I've been telling you guys this for a long time like a long long long time but I think more and more people are starting to really see it - it's like blatant now before it was like kind of subtle and you could still if you're paying attention you can still recognize it but now it is like there's no coating to it at all now it is just literally them letting us know they want us to die they want us to be put at risk so they can make more money as if they already didn't have enough they finally passed the stimulus package but the text of it has not reached the public yet so no one is sure like how much money they're going to get and they've been fighting over this since Sunday it took them days actually when this first first happened it took them less than a week to give a 1.5 trillion dollar bailout to banks and to other corporations they did that with the quickness they both both parties agreed on that mad quick and then they stalled and I was taken two to three weeks after this has started for them to even consider what it is that they're going to do for the poorest of this country because they don't care about us Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats maybe they went to battle for you know a little bit for us but not much they're literally fighting over how many crumbs they're going to give us the Republicans wanted to give us nothing pretty much and the Democrats are like wow let's throw them a bone or two and oh and also I'm just really kind of finding out about this is that our government knew that this crisis was was happening they knew about this information and there have been several people who have been caught doing insider trading so they they had this information these sold stocks because they knew what was coming and then a week or two later is when they decided to tell the public I don't know how actually how long the duration was but they knew for awhile and they didn't tell us they didn't warn us about anything you know and they did their their business on the side got rid of the stocks because they knew everything was about to drop the stock market dropped I think it was two thousand nine hundred ninety nine points within one day was his largest drop and in history either in history or the second largest drop in history like I can't remember not only one is that not safe for people to go back to work but I'm warning you guys when the US government tells you that it's safe to go back to work if deep Donald Trump tells you it's safe to go back to work and like a week or two do not do not listen to him this is going to take a lot of time because of people just automatically this quickly go back to where it can start interacting with each other again we're gonna be in the same situation as we were before you know even just reading some of these articles people are still calling it a China virus and it's so racist stop thankfully I haven't heard normal people like regular everyday people were calling it a China virus thank goodness but all of these people some of these like conservative journalists and conservative you know politicians they're still calling it the China virus there was literally I think near the photo the other day of Trump's speech and there was a picture taken from above his shoulder of his speech and he had crossed out coronavirus and wrote China virus on his speech as if we didn't already know he was a racist bigoted  the movie outbreak that I watched several days ago was released in 1995 so me as they shot it in like 93 94 you're telling me that you didn't have any idea that this could be a possibility you didn't think to maybe have a plan in place if you're right for your country you're running an entire nation and you didn't think that maybe you should have this in place in case you know some went down other countries are like all non-essential businesses have been closed mmm they automatically started giving their citizens like you know about $1,000 a week or a sir certain amount of money per week they've they've got out they've done rent freezes mortgage freezes basically all almost all bills are are on a freeze right now so people can literally stay home and if they don't have to work and they don't have to worry about anything you know and they're these countries are actually taking care of their citizens which is what you're supposed to do you know you just saw I saw an article the other day I forget which one it was that I was reading but it was a quote by Mitch McConnell saying that you know calling this still calling this the greatest country the greatest nation on earth like mind blown how in the actual is this the greatest country on Earth it never has been never not in my lifetime not before my lifetime not since its inception it was literally founded on the genocide of indigenous people and then you went from there and you went to the I'm gonna get all of this out of order because I I don't know I know history rather well because I went to school here in the United States you know in the Industrial Revolution where you know you the exploited emigrants from all over the place you know paid them horribly for like the horrible conditions that they had to work in most of them couldn't vouch for themselves or couldn't defend themselves because unions weren't a thing and you know they didn't speak English very well if at all you know yeah and then you you know you had slavery you know and then from slavery that just slavery never ended slavery just transformed my head own you had Jim Crow laws and then you had redlining you had segregation you had you know and now mass incarceration which has a loophole that says that if someone is convicted of a crime that then they can be put to work so you see all of these people there's literally I think the last quote the last statistic I read was 2.3 million people in prisons and jails and prisons in the United States a lot of them are making products for corporations like Victoria's Secret like there's so many corporations brand names that we use that people use on a regular basis that they have no idea that a prisoner made those or you know if it's not a prisoner then you have you know slavery in other countries India Bangladesh Guatemala Mexico China mm-hmm people working living and working in horrible conditions you know and even like some some businesses like lock their employees in and they have suicide nets you can google that like there's suicide nets on the outside of these these buildings so because people were jumping literally jumping to their deaths because they would rather die than to you know be exploited this way I'm just not that I'm surprised you know but I am I am like it's it is kind of shocking to hear the rhetoric not be you know in dog whistles no now they're just like coming out and saying it all but saying that I don't care about your life you know but that's exactly what they mean by in a week or two business will be you know will go back to business as normal and you guys can all go back to work and everything will be fine well let's you know that doesn't really so many people have lost their jobs already like if you have an economy that you're trying to get back up off the ground these people have nowhere to go these people don't have jobs anymore these businesses have closed permanently you know and and I was just kind of disgusted when I woke up this morning and I I've been reading all of this stuff and talking to several of my friends and you know it's just I felt like last week for the vlog I I just kind of showed what the beginning stages were like you know stating inside doing the same thing every day you know going out once once a week to go to the grocery store and this week for the vlogs I kind of want to go more in depth and so I didn't really record too much the last few days if I did you'll have seen it right before this but for this week I want to really like dive in and get to like the like the root of some of this and because this is an insane time that we're in like my brain didn't even compute that something like this is possible you know but now that it's happened I'm like that makes sense you know like it's I'm surprised I didn't think about that but unfortunately the left doesn't have a plan for what happens next so this would be a perfect opportunity if we did to like rush in and be like alright you know hey like time to implement this plan I think more and more people are seeing like what is essential and what is not essential rich people make extraordinarily rich people who exploit other people for their riches not essential edge there's only one David Moore later on or tomorrow once I read some more and I make some more talking points and so I don't just ramble on for 18 minutes and 19 seconds now all right I'll get back at y'all later are you camera shy  and I'm not even going to show you the end result of that guacamole because my avocado was not ripe and it is embarrassing had already set everything out already got my mouth ready for it and yeah I was gonna say like as soon as he felt the avocado I was like this is not it's not gonna work but I made the best of it and I'm still gonna enjoy the hell out of it damn I just remembered I left my chips downstairs well I can't eat chips and guacamole without chips so alright I'm gonna go eat now first I'm gonna go get my chips and then I'm gonna go eat
