 hello and welcome back to my channel as you saw in the title this is a attempted blood first time doing that we'll see how well that will happen um I woke up like 15 minutes ago and I'm still on the bed oh really that's me every day since the quarantine I've been like I laid down on the bed for like an hour to next to my kid she's always next to me wherever I go it's like ridiculous um yeah I just laid down for like an hour not doing it I mean what can you do I really can't be like productive that much but yeah I mean by any means find ways to be productive don't be like me I usually look at the phone so like at it like half an hour or so and when I start scrolling um on Facebook it's sad as he or she just focus dude okay it's saddens me that I still see some weird posts someone was saying that all like quarantine shouldn't be called quarantine because it's just for the sick and all jobs are essential no no why are you saying this people doing your hair is not essential designing is not essential for your life you're not gonna die if you don't do your hair for a few months or forever you're gonna be fine like really people you can't even like grasp this little concept these stay home till we can go out don't risk your life yeah so anyways I look like do you know when you wake up or like really like but the worst like I hate this anyways um but yeah um okay I have some things to do today I have to get some groceries um I hate it every time I go get groceries it's like I have to wait for like 40 minutes outside um yeah I have to wait like half an hour every time I go get food and it's very annoying um but I have to go take a shower and then um maybe do some chores do some laundry clean up a bit before going out and um take a shower of course I need a shower I'm not sure like I'm a person that takes a shower and the morning when I wake up and by the way it's 10:30 now I woke up at 10:00 I probably like just stay in bed till like 11:30 yeah that's bad um but yeah um yeah I'm I'm a person that takes a shower in the morning cuz I don't know I don't wake up to like take my shower I know lots of people that take shower at night before they sleep because it's very relaxing I get it but I really can't wake up without taking a shower and I feel like sticky and icky but sometimes I take shower twice a day I know weird but I do that because I don't like washing my hair in the morning I like washing my hair at night and give it time to like drag this in the morning I usually have to but since the quarantine I've been watching my hair in the morning cuz I have time to you know let it dry I really don't have a lot to do and I don't have to wake up and go to work so I do that in the morning these days but usually I just leave that for the night cuz um anyways um I'll see you later maybe when I get when I go get groceries or oh yeah say path day probably show you luck my cat cuz she's always around me it's ridiculous ok bye bye see you later
