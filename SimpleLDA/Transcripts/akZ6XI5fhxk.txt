 currently social distancing the majority of the country is or should be with my husband and my seven month old who you might hear from the bedroom because I'm in the living room recording this my husband is watching her right now but I am in the epicenter the u.s. epicenter downtown Seattle King County which has most of the cases of the corona virus I'm using an actual microphone for my phone so I'm really really hoping that it works because my volume has been an issue and I'm really trying to up my video game your game so I'm hoping that works because I tend to talk kind of like soft in these videos so this will be the test but as I said I'm here in Seattle you can see in the background I haven't left my house and like I think today is the 15th I've been left in 15 days no more actually okay usually it's a long story mr. ho mom I usually go out on the weekends well my husband's at work during the week this has actually been like 20 days I actually didn't take it too seriously at first I thought you know I was hearing conflicting reports about not as that you know it's like the flu do what you normally do flu season kills a bunch of people every year this is just something new don't freak out I would read stories like that and think okay whatever like flu season this is something similar just it is what it is but then you would hear other stories of people freaking out and saying that it's like MRSA and SARS and that it's a respiratory you know it's killing a lot of older people and then we referring to notes because I don't know if my memory was that great before I became a mom but since I became a mom I am scatterbrained and I have trouble getting organized and I need to try and stay on task so my video was not 45 minutes long because nobody won on what wants to watch a 45 minute long video about somebody living in Seattle all right hiding from the coronavirus feel like it wasn't until the first death in from coronavirus that things really started to spiral I think it was a man in Kirkland Washington which is about 30 minutes north of Seattle who died from a February twenty-ninth that is when things people will seem to take it more seriously because I think that was the first death in the US and then of course the corona virus came in through Seattle from China so this is where it all started this seems to be where it's the worst in the u.s. Oh on that day I remember Danny Danny was supposed to go and get me Cheesecake Factory after dinner but then he's like okay well they're sending everybody home to work from home things are starting to kind of get serious and so we started ordering some non perishable things things that you know we can freeze all of that and you know I'm he was I was definitely rely on him to keep up with everything because he reads and hears more than I do it's like you know I think this is gonna get bad and I was like no no no because the end like I was just I was hearing conflicting things you know some people naturally are gonna downplay things and other people are just more prone to freaking out and so you really don't know what to really believe and how much you need to prepare because I don't want to go buy a bunch of food that I didn't need Oh in preparation for this video I decided to kind of look up what is known about the coronavirus because I was just hearing some many conflicting things and so I thought for the purpose of this video I should know a little something so I took some screenshots of some things that I found and if I can up my editing game I'll learn how to like put them in as I'm talking about them we'll see if I can do that so when I first searched the coronavirus hey there's a map that comes up when you search it and it shows you know where it is in the world and it's just about everywhere China and Europe looks crazy and then my first so I went on experience day rcg is calm and it showed this was as of yesterday it showed 142,000 649 confirmed cases over 5300 deaths in over 135 countries so but then within a day I went to that same website and looked at that same picture and the confirmed cases had jumped to one hundred fifty-three thousand 648 with 52 over 5700 deaths 546 countries so it is snowballing and it's scary because I mean obviously the more people that stay at home the slower and then eventually it'll stop but it's I don't know how long I'm gonna be in this apartment basically I looked up what is the current virus and I feel like it well it is a new virus and so people are just learning about it as more people get it and they come in for testing so it's not something that's anybody's ever seen before but it just belonged to a large family of viruses that we've heard about before that are extremely deadly so this this is either from the CDC website or the World Health Organization website but what is the current virus family kernel viruses are large family of viruses that can cause illness in humans and animals and they cause respiratory infections ranges from the common colds more severe seizes diseases like MRSA and stars and co vid 19 which is the current virus that we're dealing with right now is the most recently discovered corona virus and it says what is co vid 19 and so I'm just gonna bring the laptop here so I'll have to look off to the side there's a little extra light from the laptop okay so it was not known before its outbreak in one China and December 2019 and this is that the most common symptoms are fever tiredness and dry cough you can have aches pains and nasal congestion runny nose sore throat or diarrhea they're usually mild and begin gradually and of course some people that become infected don't show symptoms and don't feel unwell over 80% of the people cover from the Z's without needing special treatment but one out of every six people who get it becomes seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing older people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure heart problems or diabetes are likely are more likely develop serious illness and it says if you develop fever cough or difficulty breathing you should seek medical attention what I found online was saying that you need to stay three feet away from somebody who is infected because it is spread through droplets on somebody coughs and it can live on surfaces for I think hours or up to days after it's been infected and antibiotics are not effective in preventing or treating kovat 19 because antibiotics apparently do not work against viruses only bacterial infections working on a vaccine right now but they to my knowledge don't have one yet and I saw them advertising like I could be wrong but I believe I saw something advertising people my area there were one in volunteers I think they were gonna give me like a thousand dollars a person to be tested to find a vaccine fit another question on this website was is coping 19 the same as SARS and it's saying that it's not I think it's related to it like it's in the same family but sorrow stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome and that broke out in 2003 so Cove in 19 and SARS are related genetically but the diseases they caused our different SARS was much more deadly and much less infectious than kovat 19's there weren't as many outbreaks but it was deadlier and according to this there have not been any outbreaks of SARS since 2003 the incubation period for covin 19 is between 1 and 14 days but accordance website it says that it's the average is most commonly around five days and then I think initial reports were saying that somebody had caught like the initial person had caught code the 19 from an animal and while coronaviruses are large family viruses that are common in animals typically when people get it it spread from person to person through those droplets and someone coughs and so it says for example SARS was associated with civet give it it spelled see I ve T cats and MRSA was transmitted by dromedary camels so this is possible animal sources of covin 19 have not been confirmed and it says if you're visiting live animal markets avoid direct contact and surfaces that those animals have touched and then ensure good food safety practices when preparing raw meat they do not think that you can get kovat 19 from a pet there was a story about a dog in China I believe there was a dog infected in Hong Kong but there was no evidence that the dog or a cat can transmit to a person I think I already said that it can live on surfaces from a few from hours to days but if you receive a package for anywhere that Co bed 19 has been reported this is the likelihood the infected person packing the your items is low and so the rest of contracting the virus is low permit a cage that's been moved traveled I supposed to different conditions in temperature and then there was some like you know other articles that I saw about how China is supposedly saying that Cova night team came from Army personnel from the US who had visited their part of China in October so like you you'll you'll Google and you'll find a bunch of stuff so just in my area I found some numbers about the positive slash confirmed cases and so this is saying there's over 700 confirmed cases in Washington which I thought was six hundred and another source that I saw but anyway the majority of them and I'll try and put this up on the screen the majority of them were in King County which is where Seattle was located and there have been 420 and it also looks like Seattle's had the most number of deaths at 37 and so this information I got yesterday or today and there's also some information on the confirmed cases by age and like they're saying that's typically older people that have it and then how many people will have been tested and then whether the majority is female or male pretty I mean pretty soon after the man in Kirkland died people were staying home at least up here I know that it can look a little bit different around the country it's interesting I'll be looking at social media in there there are still people out there who are just going out and living their lives and maybe they're taking more precautions but they're out there I'm not I left my house all of March so but around here I remember seeing shortly after they were telling people to work from home if they could there were a few restaurants in my neighborhood not too far from my apartment that shut down because they were down 70% of revenue and so restaurants you know anybody that relies on people to come to their business have been shutting down laying people off and it's crazy just how fast that can happen I mean it doesn't even feel real you would never think something like that could happen in this country to this magnitude and let alone you know just wrote me as worldwide and so you know when you look at a map as jarring and it really is out of a movie anything worse that you know not that kovat nineteen's not bad but I mean you know you see how he Azam B apocalypse movies and shows and everything like can you imagine a more deadly crippling disease getting out and I mean they don't even know where this one came from and how it got out I'm sure they'll find out and but I'm kind of just almost at a loss for words because I've never seen anything like this I don't think any just have any of us have you know an Earl in our lifetime at least the game my generation my parents generation maybe two anyway when all this first started kind of like really spiraling I remember hearing about you know there's a facebook employee that they found to be tested positive for coronavirus Amazon employee and I am right in the heart of downtown and so this is literally in my backyard and even though it doesn't seem to be necessarily affecting babies and kids I do have a seven month old and I don't want to get sick day doesn't want to get sick we don't want to pass it along to somebody else who we may encounter in the building that who knows may be compromised in some way may be older maybe you know has some underlying illness that would make it harder for them to battle the infection so it's pretty scary like we're right here in ground zero so when it really started escalating and the person died and people started buying up the so I mean that's you know people started buying at the stores and you know I was flashing back to when I lived in Florida and there was a hurricane coming and just the panic and I you know I tried to get toilet paper and it sold out everywhere I think that you can still get it in stores but they won't ship to you and then you know you go in someplace like Amazon and what tow paper you can find there like you know six rolls for $75 like it's insane to me hurt when I saw Tom Hanks and his wife tested positive for coronavirus while they're in Australia everybody was like oh  like our most beloved celebrity they're trying to take from us somebody protect Betty White like put her in quarantine right now and I saw also that the Canadian prime minister's wife tested positive for coronavirus we've been comparing it to some 90s movie called outbreak that I never saw but like now I kind of feel like I need to watch it but we when things started really getting serious we try to order off Amazon fresh and they had either completely booked up all their delivery times or they weren't delivering at all because we couldn't use them I had to use instacart for the first time and there was a lot of product that was low and then of course when you order from something like instacart it's somebody that's just going to a grocery store shortly before your delivery window and purchasing these items so if they get there and they're sold out you don't get them it's not like when you order from Amazon and you know electronically you get put into a queue and you somehow reserve what you've purchased it's not like that witness to cart and so and then we purchased another we purchased it we put an order on Amazon pantry for a lot of non perishable things and then when Amazon fresh was delivering again we got a some fresh stuff like I was craving strawberries and tomatoes also ordered some more non perishable things and I think that we need to place another order again because people are going crazy someone on my facebook was talking about how I think she lives in Colorado and they didn't have any chicken like they people will just win stockpile chicken because on Friday when things started spiraling so today is Sunday this past Friday was Friday the 13th I totally wasn't even like intending to like wear this and like how that correlation but I have so much Friday the 13th and I'm around I'm straight like classic horror stuff that gods are on any given day I'm wearing this I tried to place an insta car order on Friday when I puts it on Friday they did still have toilet paper but my delivery window was until 5 to 7 and so by that time people had gone and taken it all for themselves so I have like a little conversation with instacart person like there's nothing left he's like the paper towel and the toilet paper aisles are D but the memes are pretty amazing on Friday 13 so like on Friday 13th everything started ramping up and more people started staying home and said like the memes oh my god that means they were so good like I've got one of Chucky from child's play and then Jason because you know it was his day and the coronavirus overshadowed it so it was just it was funny you got to find humor in situations like this and it was kind of like the beginning of the situation and so people were just kind of like didn't know whether to laugh or cry basically but I think for me when it really hit me that it was getting serious was schools were sending their spring breaks the NBA was canceling everything my best friend had a trip to Disney Disney World to close down concerts were getting cancelled Broadway was closing down I think when I saw these like official businesses and and things that were like we have to close up shop it's dangerous out there I was like oh my god like I can take that because when you hear these stories you know out there and you don't really know what what to believe or how to act for me and you know because I've never experienced anything like this before my mind is okay well things will get better like I don't really want to like abruptly change my routine if things are gonna be okay but when these big businesses that make a lot of money or like we are shutting down because of this thing you have to take notice and then you know it's really serious I saw also that they were putting bands on large gathering so like you know those are there were large or large examples of people canceling but like cities and things were also canceling you know smaller scale things that were over a certain number of people and then of course the US declared state of emergency to use I guess funds to health situation and the thing that makes me so sad is that there are a lot of people out there that that this is affecting that don't have the ability to buy up all the toilet paper or all the food in the grocery stores maybe you don't have a support system especially you know the the people that it that the disease is seeming to target more which is elderly somebody posted a picture of this older woman with a cart in the grocery store at an empty aisle trying to find supplies and people forget about others and times like this and people get really selfish and terrified and just think about themselves so now I don't really know how much longer all is going to go on the more people that stay at home the faster it can be under control and yeah I'm still in shock basically just how widespread it is and I kind of don't know what else to say about it but I am staying inside and hopefully I can continue to get items you know sent to me so I don't have to go out I don't I mean I've got we're on our last roll of toilet paper I've got some paper towels and I've got baby wipes so when those are out and unless more items get back in stock online that can be shipped to me I'm gonna have to brave the streets just to get to a paper so I definitely just wanted to make a video about it because I feel like this is a really important scary time in history of the world and even if nobody watches this video at least it's something that I can look back and say yeah like do you remember when we went through the coronavirus like that was insane here's hoping that you know people get better and we don't see any more deaths and ironically while I'm sitting here and I have the time I'm going to be recording a bath and Bodyworks hall slash body shop also it's kind of ironic that I'm gonna be talking about soap in the next video but there it is so your watches the video watch the next one and like comment and subscribe if you will I sure would appreciate it see you next video     you
