 tonight the Chinese city of Wuhan and nearby towns lockdown californian is 40 million residents are in lockdown to try to contain covered 19 Queens in New York is the worst infected district in what is now the world's worst infected city and the doctors and nurses don't know what hit them I kid you not in January 2020 the world was hit with one of the largest viral pandemics that we've ever experienced by March the death toll would reach the tens of thousands with a global infection rate reaching millions people started to panic grocery stores ran out of household goods like meat rice and toilet paper people hoarded hand sanitizer cleaning products and masks leaving little protection for those who really needed it but in spite of everything going on life kept moving along this is our story of living through one of the worst global pandemics in history   alright guys good morning this morning we are on our way to run a couple of errands and take the dog over to the vet because unfortunately she's got a couple little lumps and bumps that we need to have looked at and today is April 7th 2020 I'm sure if you guys are anything like me you are living in a kovat 19 lockdown situation so everything right now is a little bit weird and the phrase I keep repeating to myself is it's a really weird time that we're living in there's a lot of strange stuff happening a lot of social distancing people having to keep away from each other grocery store is only letting a certain number people in it running out of stuff you know schools are closed work sites or closed offices are closed people are having to stay home and I wanted to document some of this just because I think it's so interesting and it's such a time to be alive it's I mean this is gonna be a time in history where people are talking about a pandemic that we have not really had a pandemic in you know several several almost 200 years 1918 I think was the last massive pandemic that killed millions of people that the 1918 flu pandemic and then of course we had SARS and h1n1 more recently but those were not at the scale of what we're seeing with coronavirus arc Ovid 19 happening today so we're gonna go take the little puppy dog for her appointment and check some stuff out and just kind of document what life is like during this pandemic because it is a really interesting time to be alive but I hope you guys are all staying safe and healthy and happy and grateful out there let's go get on these errands and see what the world looks like so one example of things that have completely changed since the world global pandemic of kovat 19 is that we are actually at the vet right now and we can't go inside so what I have to do is actually call the vet they're gonna come out and get the dog and then bring her back for her appointment which is a little bit strange and kind of sad because I don't really like bringing in her bringing her there or leaving her there by herself but I know that they're really good here and she really likes them so it's gonna be okay right right you like the vet you don't care do you well at least she gets to see people she likes so we are all done with Callie's vet appointment I just wanted to come over here we're over at Carolina Place mall right now now normally any day the week weekend doesn't matter this place is chock-full of cars it's very very busy mall one of the busiest in the area probably one of the busiest in the southeast and I just want to show you guys what the world looks like right now because it's it's kind of eerie I mean right now I'm just sitting at a stop sign at the mall and no one's behind me there's no one at the mall there's no one around and that is because we are under what's called a stay-at-home order now that means that really unless you're doing something essential like going to the grocery store going to the hardware store to pick up supplies for your house or something like that you're really not supposed to be out doing anything so no shopping no dining out nothing like that because we are trying to really slow down the spread of kovat 19 and do what's called flattening the curve so we talk about a curve of infection rates we want to set that going really really high and keeping the peak we want to keep that as flat as possible so we don't exhaust our hospital resources and staff with people who are gonna need you know ventilators or intensive care or anything like that from this disease but let's go take a little ride around the outside of the mall we're gonna stay in the car we're not gonna touch anything but I just kind of want to see what it looks like because I think this is again a really interesting time to be alive so let's go check it out  all right so we are back at the house from the vet appointment and this is one of the other things about being in this epidemic that's a little bit weird it's that all the gyms are completely closed because we're not allowed to have anybody in groups of bigger than 10 in one place at one time so that means all the gyms are closed all the fitness facilities are closed and if you know anything about me you do know that I am a I love to workout I do love going to the gym and lifting and hanging out with my friends there I can't really do that right now so we've been working on doing some really quick just like 30-minute workouts just to get moving to keep my mind occupied and we're gonna go hit one of those right now so I've got some power blocks just some weights I'm gonna see what I can do with just one weight in about 20 to 30 minutes and see if we can get a good   super-quick a little chipper kettlebell swings and then I swing ground to overhead who done those a long time I'm realizing I'm Way out of cardio shape Oh guess one good thing about this pandemic he's uh I can do more stuff like this alright guys good morning and welcome back to the video so everything is shut down no one's really allowed to go anywhere we're really just allowed to do like a central shopping and things like that but you know we can still get in our cars and drive around we can still kind of do some stuff and some essential businesses are still working now luckily one of those essential businesses is construction which means our house is still coming along and on schedule which is amazing we were super worried about that happening we were thought there might be some delays and either us getting into the house or the actual construction of the house but we haven't showed you guys an update of what's been happening in the house in quite a while so figured we'll take a run over the house today I'll show you guys what's been going on since we actually closed a couple weeks from now let's go take a look at how things are shaping up and give you a tour of our pretty much finished house  with so much changing the world around us the few constants have been our focus on the house and our new baby we've been so fortunate that we haven't experienced any delays in our build and then we've had a place to stay while our house is being constructed in our downtime we've had long conversations about raising our children in this house and how we see ourselves staying here for the long haul we're so grateful to be able to be a part of this process building our dream home where we can raise a family have new experiences and create so many amazing memories while this process hasn't always been easy we'll always be grateful for the people who are involved and help move this thing across the finish line in spite of the huge challenges that we all faced and through all of this through everything and in spite of everything I'm hopeful that we'll all come out of this more grateful more fulfilled and more dedicated to our families we'll see you guys in the next video
