 you guys matter welcome back to my youtube channel and welcome back to another quarantine vlog we have a pretty fun day plan we have a couple things we need to do and I'm just gonna take you along with me we're gonna go back into the bathroom and do my skincare I wanted to record that for you guys and show you guys some of the products I've been using so let's get up the only thing I have done is brush my teeth and pop on my contacts and I also made my bed as you can tell so now we're just gonna head into the bathroom and finish my skincare  alright guys that so for breakfast I'm gonna make a smoothie and I'm also gonna make some avocado toast and some eggs I'm in the mood for that today so today's breakfast smoothie is going to contain some mango chunks chia seeds collagen peptides this stuff for vital proteins is so good for you some spinach some kale we're gonna also add a banana some apples carrots cucumber and celery and we're also gonna make some avocado toast and an egg so we're gonna start making that egg now as well I'm just gonna throw everything into my brand-new blender this is the Ninja one it's amazing I've been using it for the past two days and I'm a huge fan it's so good  a lot of you had commented in my last vlog that it would be better and would taste better if I mashed up the avocado as if they'll work walk with some salt and pepper and that's what I've started to do and it's amazing you have the egg in the pan so we're gonna put this on top really quickly and the smoothies ready I'm gonna pour that it this is like every basic girls breakfast but you know what I used to be like everyone has avocado toast I don't get it but you guys it's honestly so yummy so easy to make in the morning if you're like feeling lazy yeah it's just like delicious I used the whole avocado instead of half and I'm like realizing now that I put way too much avocado but it's like the egg is almost ready and I'm gonna pour out this smoothie really quick I'm gonna save some for later cuz I don't drink like another one of these snack so this is breakfast we have some avocado toast with some egg and a green smoothie have already had a couple of sip because my dad called me to check on me and I couldn't resist so yeah but this is breakfast  okay guys so I finished breakfast and I was just scrolling through emails basically this morning and now I'm gonna get ready and do my makeup I'm just gonna do my everyday makeup pretty much and I literally organized my entire vanity last night like super late at night everything is nice and organized which I'm so happy about so I'm just gonna do a quick little voiceover of my makeup we'll see what I do I do a little every day might add some color we'll see where has the time gone so I posted our video finally of me and my sister I will link it down below if you haven't seen it and Nicolette got her flowers in the mail which I'm really happy about well done the mail but they delivered it to her house and right now I'm gonna make some lunch I also filmed some tik toks this is today's tik tok outfit of the day so my top is from Mayra swim let me actually show you guys in the mirror this is today's tik tok outfit of the day my top is from Myra slim it's actually swimsuit top but I wear it as a regular top and then my sweats are from boohoo which you guys have probably seen in the try on how I did and another vlog that I think I posted already and these are super comfortable super high quality I've been wearing boo boo forever if you guys want to get really good cheap sweats this is like the best quality ever I used to spend like 80 $90 on sweats and they wouldn't even last through the washer and these are amazing we are actually going to be eating some meal prep I guess I'm from get eat clean and I'll tag them here so you guys can check them out they're amazing if you're in Miami or South Florida they're amazing my friends put me on to them shoutout to Vanessa Christine Shep shows a youtube channel which I will also link down below so I think today we're gonna eat some drop out Vienna yeah I'm in the mood for some Cuban food throw probably how really is the mood look so these are already come prepped all you have to do is heat them up in the microwave and you're good to go but yeah guys that was really excited about my Smashbox campaign I'm actually wearing just barely from they're always on cream to matte lipsticks I absolutely love them and the formula you guys should check out the video if you haven't seen it I'm so proud of it and Anna and I had so much fun filming that this is not sponsored by the way I just absolutely am so happy that I'm doing this I'm trying to eat as clean as possible so it comes with some ropa vieja some I think this is fufu lip blot on all and then some green beans and lunch for today I don't know if anyone has this problem there's fridge I think there's like a wiring issue but my water takes so long to get out of my fridge and into my cup it's probably gonna take me like two minutes to get all this water out and no maintenance person could come fix it until this whole thing is over so yeah look we're still making not even halfway there so grazie also I don't put ice in my water anymore I feel like the forum water is just better for my digestive system I have a really sensitive stomach so if I haven't eaten anything all day and I drink like really cold water in the morning I will literally have a stomach ache it's so crazy that happened to me once when I was in high school and it freaked me out so now I just try and make sure there like drinks lukewarm water it's like my stomach is a little empty if I had just like woken up but you guys I also poured up some of the green smoothie that I had made earlier today and we're gonna eat our dough Buffy huh this looks so yummy and some water you guys no one understands like my love for ropa vieja and it's so hard to make like the way my mom makes it is so fire I need her to like properly teach me how to use like the pressure cooker can make it fun this is amazing this is super healthy and it has all the nutrition facts on the little thing but I honestly just eat these not like four calories or anything I've never counted a calorie in my life I think it's like a mental thing and it's so bad for your mental health I think everyone struggles with their body and you know there's things about our bodies that we may not like but I have never tried to like suppress my eating or anything like that because I know what it's like to really want to eat and not be able to because I struggled with like a really severe anxiety a couple months ago so now I just try and eat you know obviously as clean as possible but I'm not gonna like suppress hunger or like suppress like wanting to eat food to look thinner I just want to try like going on walks and seeing how that goes and obviously like the meal prep is amazing having green juice eating as clean as possible but you can have a cheat meal you guys wanna check them out and put them right here this is amazing so I know a lot of us aren't Florentine and you guys are trying to find things to do and a lot of you guys have reached out to me and I'm so happy that you guys are all taking this step that you guys want to start your YouTube channels and I want to help you guys to the best of my ability obviously so I'm going to teach you guys how to make a youtube thumbnail because I was working on the thumbnail today that I made for my sister and I was like you know what if I would have known how to do this like I wouldn't have struggled as much as I did when I started my youtube channel yeah I'm not doing anything super crazy interesting so the best I can do is obviously you know show you guys something I guess so what I used to create my thumbnails is PicMonkey I've been using it for years I actually have the membership I pay monthly for it's nothing crazy I think it's like ten dollars a month so I'm gonna show you guys what the website would look like if you were to create a thumbnail this is what the website should look like this probably wouldn't be on here you have to create an account so this is my account Amanda then when you will get on the website you go to create new and you're gonna go on blank canvas and this is the page that you're supposed to land on and then here it says create custom so what you're gonna do is put sixteen hundred so one six zero zero by nine hundred pixels so these are the dimensions for a youtube thumbnail and then you're gonna click and make it and you know you don't have to do any of this you just put create so once you get on this page right here you're gonna go to add an image you're gonna go to computer which is this right here or wherever you might have the photo so it could be here in your downloads or it could be in your photos so here we have our photo and as you can tell there's a little border here that's still white you're gonna make sure you fill that all the way up it has to fit the entire thumbnail so we're just gonna zoom that in until you feel that you know the sizing is adequate and this is what we're trying to do to it so we're gonna do like this curved text thingy that I did and you're gonna start off by going to this sidebar right here and there's a bunch of different tools that you can use and if you have the membership there's just a lot of different text that you can use that you wouldn't be able to use without it but honestly I didn't have the membership for years and it makes zero difference it just says sometimes I downloaded Fonz off the internet and I use him on here and you can't do that without it so we're gonna go to the little two T's that's next to this so this is text and you're gonna go to add text and you're gonna type whatever it is so we're gonna do get ready and that is what we're gonna use on this side so we're gonna basically minimize it we're gonna put it up here basically and we're gonna go to this little sidebar that comes with this you can actually move it around and here is basically where you can customize the font the sizing the color the drop shadow so I like to do for my thumbnails like personally I go to effects and I go to drop shadow it could be a black color you can like literally pick any color that you choose we recently used this red one so that's what we're gonna go with and you're gonna basically play with it so you can like do the fade where you can make it really vibrant or less vibrant you can really play with it so I add intensity and a little bit of food and the angle is perfect you don't really need to play with it and then you're gonna close the drop shadow and then you're gonna go to curved text so this curves it you can really mess around with it so we're doing this get ready so we're basically going to wait let's move this to the side let's click on the text and we're gonna play with it so you can you know move it shake it around so we're doing get ready right here we're actually gonna move it a little bit more ready and that is the get ready portion of the thumbnail or actually going to minimize it just a tap there we go and then we're gonna do with us on this curved part so we're gonna do the same thing and repeat it so we're gonna go to add text and then we're gonna put with us and we're gonna go here drop shadow you know minimize the fade a little bit add some intensity and color we're gonna use the red and we're gonna go to curb text and in order to get the inverted curve you just go to curvature and you like go like this and then you're gonna close it up a little bit just to like minimize and then that's maybe a little smaller and there you have a thumbnail basically I feel like I can like fix this a little more but yeah that's just kind of like the basis of it and that's what I do usually when I make my thumbnails so yeah I hope you enjoyed that quick little thumbnail tutorial you guys want me to do an in-depth youtube video on youtube 101 and how to get started I could totally help you guys um I guess I'll smell some tea in this video so that's what I use for my thumbnails and to edit my videos I use Final Cut Pro you definitely don't need to start on Final Cut I've been using Final Cut for like three years now two and a half years I think three years already and I started out on iMovie and you don't really need like a crazy editing software to start off like if I'm being honest you can edit on your phone I know a lot of my fan accounts make the craziest edits and I don't even know what software they use they get really creative but I've been using Final Cut for years um you need to have a MacBook Pro and a MacBook Air like cannot handle that software there's a lot of really helpful tutorials I will actually link them down below for you guys if you guys you know recently have purchased Final Cut my friend Alexa recently just started using it sorry my translator just texted me that's another thing so as obviously my audience is expanding I actually got a translator that's working on Spanish subtitles so he translates the majority of my videos and you know he does a great job and yet we've been working together so my audience that speaks Spanish can obviously understand what I'm saying but yeah I've been basically using Final Cut for years I absolutely love it you can use Adobe I feel like Adobe's really complicated and I just like simple you know things so you could download plugins on Final Cut which I like and yeah it's really it I can do an in-depth tutorial one day or include it in a vlog or something but you know just little tips if you want to start your YouTube channel absolutely love putting my thumbnails on PicMonkey and sometimes all facetune them on my phone airdrop it to my computer and voila you know but yeah guys that is it for this little tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed I have been making tic TOCs and watching them all day that's pretty much all I freaking done but I want to get started on this book which is called the thousands floor by Katherine McGee I've had this forever so I'm gonna take a little while to get started on this book I'll let you know how I feel about it but this book is really interesting as some of you may know I love to read I have like the biggest book collection these are my current reads right now I don't know if you guys are familiar with the 39 clues I think that there were like multiple authors for this series amazing I barely remember it but I'm rereading it and I bought all of them so I can like start reading them again and then the selection by Kiera Cass is a staple I have read this series so many times and I'm obsessed with it so I'm gonna start this bad boy right here today and I'm excited I've also been watching money heists and on my blog amazing I'll touch base when I'm getting ready for dinner doing something interesting I'm not doing something crazy in this vlog but I will be making dinner tonight and we might be deep cleaning a closet and my house so high so I'm being responsible and doing the dishes really quick I had totally forgotten to do the dishes earlier today  okay now that that's done we're gonna get started on dinner I'm gonna be making some orange chicken it's already kind of pre-made you just kind of have to like pop it on the stove I was gonna do some salmon but I am not in the mood for fish right now I don't know I'm just like not feeling it too much so we're going to make some orange chicken and we're gonna I think I don't even know what I'm gonna eat it with what do I want with it I do have some homemade mash we can make some rice I'm gonna call Ali cuz she's coming downstairs to eat dinner with me maybe I'm gonna see what she wants cuz she loves my orange chicken so let me ask her hi thank you I'm making orange chicken oh my gosh okay what should I make with it should I make rice or something I don't know rice okay I'm gonna have a little bit of rice I'm just like not in the mood to eat like rice I'll see what I do well if you want to hang out later you can come over maybe come over No okay attitude if you want to come down you can alright so I don't know I'm just gonna make the chicken I'm not like super crazy hungry so I'm just gonna you know make the orange chicken in my next vlog I'll teach you guys how to make my occasion salmon which is not easy but I'm just not in the mood for fish today I'm sorry so I'm taking some damp paper towel and the chicken to defrost will the chicken that we're gonna be using and we're basically popping this and put it in there for about like 40 seconds just so it defrost it's been defrosting for a minute already like on the countertop but I just wanted to make sure that while I'm cooking it it's not like cold inside even though it's a crispy outside so I do this just to make sure that I'm not biting into cold chicken even though I've been cooking it and then we have the sauce over here I've already used some of it because I made orange chicken the other day and it's really yummy I get mine at Costco I instacart it it actually and that's gonna be dinner I'm also gonna make some tea because I'm gonna go to drinks I'm like lavender tea to like calm me down I'm trying to go to bed earlier but I'm struggling guys it's nine o'clock so I think what we're gonna do is we're gonna cook this chicken and then we're going it to Swiffer the house and broom it a little bit and then we're gonna try and self tan because I'm not tan enough alrighty so you're gonna grab your olive oil or a vegetable oil or whatever it is you may use we're gonna pop some onto the pan now we're just gonna put the all away and I'm putting this unlike medium to high heat and then we're just gonna pop the chicken in there so this is what I like to drink at night it's the yogi honey lavender stress really and I really like it or I'll have constant comments it's really yummy as well you have to you know do your little tick-tock down while you're cooking I'm so lame I know you guys even watch me at this place chicken is done on the court into the plate

you know my makeup to the ultimate test tomorrow so I want to have like their face from the night before I do that to my skin that's like the equivalent of falling asleep with makeup on and trust me understand about everybody I really have to do this but I think it'd be a cool video idea and it'll be a fun little thing to do while we're in quarantine you guys look at the studio heart looks it's so crazy it's literally empty you know this is our little project 114 over hold on I'm looking for self tanner oh I have up the two overexpress or I can do where I fell asleep with it on not sponsored I love this stuff they've been sending it to me since I was like 15 or 16 I have the self tanner on and I'm going to attempt to put self tanner like where I would contour slash bronze for like natural-looking definition I'm scared I'm gonna go get a makeup brush really quick and yeah so the tan is on you know having a robe on and we're gonna let it develop for two hours    we're watching Jonas LA this you to do my favorite Disney show I used to be so boy crazy - the Jonas Brothers what what's your favorite save now it's Nick right oh my god I picked up no one wanted Kevin I like him and his wife and his little daughters are cute this is my face right now still you know developing right well touch base later Amanda's making me her famous oatmeal dessert we have camera woman out of a on Zack we're gonna make my so Nicolette kind of introduced me to this I usually have this for breakfast but I kind of have it as a dessert when I don't like to feel like you know eating too trivia whatever Amanda's a great cook so whatever she makes I always liked it some berries some milk II need some milk now that I have to clean this don't want any of the orange chicken good today so the key to this is to not put a lot of milk you kind of want it to be like thicker so you're gonna do two packets of oatmeal and then put it in a little bit of almond milk or oat milk whatever you might have and then you're gonna put it in the microwave so that's the consistency you have a sandwich moody what was that I throw that ass back in let me see you do a split oh god I'm going to says got three on the -  I'm on your ass back why is everything good so see that it's like thick it's not like fully wet and then you're gonna put honey you're gonna get almond butter like the chocolate one it's very yummy the key is to eat it with this because without this you're missing out then we have raspberries and blueberries and those are our toppings and then it's like a really quick and easy dessert yummy chef Amanda in the house okay you got anyway I'll scoop it for you you gotta get a good scoop of almond butter of this and then get a raspberry a little raspberry  get the Alma but you have to get all good I love it so much it looks like it would taste weird but actually it isn't really good yeah juju shucks well shut them in those ten out of ten recommend Nicolette Grey's oatmeal recipe
