topic of the vlog hello oh okay oh she's back here hello are we gonna walk yep do you like the work from home yeah we stopped down is it cold yeah Oh chilly okay good thing I brought no jackets good thing with you good anyways I just got back from my trips to LA and then I actually impromptu book to fight from my latest Salt Lake City to see my boyfriend so I just got back from all that and I will be like self isolating everything I think it's everyone social responsibility to do that so I'll be doing that and half them home and a half from school because classes start oh basically just to play guys let's just sit let's date and have a chat okay so I'll go like this basically I let's just start from the beginning future Kendall if you're watching this and you can't really remember like what was going on there is a outbreak a pandemic and it's just rocking the world and so it wasn't that serious when you went on spring break and now it is and basically everything's like on the verge of a locked out everyone's supposed to be social social distancing themselves like up to six like six feet away no large groups all of that good stuff so what that means for me is halfway through my actual spring break to LA my school was basically went online for the rest of the semester and they extended spring break for one week and she banned flights were super cheap and it wasn't really that bad yet so I bought a flight to Salt Lake and flew there for four nights or three nights I think three or four and then I just got home yesterday and it is the 17th and it's like looking a little sketchy with terms of like lockdown so stuff like that so yeah because I've been traveling so much I don't want other people at danger so I'll be participating in the quarantine you necessarily because I don't need to be quarantined but the social distancing self quarantine type of situation and yes so I'll be doing this week here and then next week at Tech because school start school starts and I want to just maintain some sort of routine so I'll be doing a lot of videos of just like how to do that or how I'm doing it but today is day one of my social distancing kovat 19 lifestyle I'm at home and I really don't have many clothes because they're all either dirty from Spring Break or all I brought with spring break for California clothes yeah my mom and I gonna gonna walk and that's why you just saw her peepin and then I will update you guys on the rest of the day  hey nephew I throw it just got back from our walk we did actually pop into Whole Foods and get a couple lesson in the groceries but we like wiped everything down with the PLA after we touched it and before and whatnot so now Stein's dice I mean it's that's technically like we're not in courting but we did practice like social distancing or whatever while we were there so that was just nice it like added some normalcy to the day so I'd recommend just doing something that makes you feel normal whether it's like driving through with Starbucks so to like have that or whatever but I'm going to probably like unpack and do some laundry I need to get on my laptop and do some work I also kind of want to film a fashion video I'd love to do today Wow hello I am getting ready to take pictures actually I know I said I was going to do like literally everything else but I'm not so I gotta take some pictures
