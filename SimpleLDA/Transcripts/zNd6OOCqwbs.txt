 all right we just stocked up on a ton of food yeah this is absolutely this is actually our second trip here about food yeah we got all them out we got eggs sweet we got this huge chicken and then we got two of them more of them chicken down there because Kyle yesterday came just in time and they were bloating out the chicken but yeah obviously you guys know the corona virus is going on and Kyle and I are thinking that where you are gonna be under quarantine just like Italy was so we're just being prepared here because yeah I mean I think there's going to be like a two-week quarantine for the United States and you know I'm in contest prep right now and I just need to make sure that I'm still staying on my diet and we will hopefully I'm pretty sure the gyms maybe closed I really don't know as of right now though yeah today Kyle and I we're gonna get in a workout Kyle's cousin lives pretty close to us she does have a gym but was like minimal equipment she has like some dumbbells and some stuff so I'll definitely be sharing some at-home workout those you guys if this happens I don't know for sure yet I'm just pretty positive it's going to happen so comment below if you want to see like the at home workouts and our tips for that it's pretty basic but we'll be sending it out to our yep so I am trying to stay positive over here you got to like focus on like you know the good things at least we have air in our home and we have electricity and yeah we work from home but I know it's really stressful for a lot of competitors out there right now I mean I totally understand what you guys are going through people that are probably 2 or 3 weeks out from their show not knowing if it's going to be canceled or not you know and the service industry a lot of people like away from the hobby of the sport but people who make a living right there Giles sister it so sucks for people who you know whether they have medical bills coming up or older people family members or jobs that they're not going to get money for so that's kind of a bigger picture that you need to realize - oh I know I know but I just know I have a lot of people that follow me because competing and I just but obviously yeah there's other people are being affected by it - I mean what we do is it is a privilege and we're choosing to prep and compete but everywhere ok well I can't eat that bark thins I'm excited got the other ones - yeah I mean we just I just stocked up on a lot of frozen veggies now we got to get the coffee chocolate ok you're showing like I'm on a hundred carbs so it's different for me here today is a refeed - yeah yeah guys we just got the basics here I mean I got some oatmeal too and some rice cakes CT yeah here's my oatmeal my dumb can't live without my gum and yeah so we're gonna unload this and then we're gonna head to the gym how all this lost us okay that's the chicken plus look at this order I got in the mail today I am set for the proton here as you guys know I do all of my own tan when protein is not at my event but I got hooked up the overnight competition with the super dark and then the topcoat and then this is when you have like back-to-back shows and you need to get rid of your tan this really really gets rid of it it's the tan remover get prepare yourself yeah she's just hanging out of there and I'm gonna try this it's hair away so you don't have to shave I'm gonna try this maybe all my arms or something it's like Nair so try that out this two-minute tan is amazing by the way if you need a quick tan this stuff's legit use code Oh Dan 22 get 20% off open up that post-workout meal 10 ounces of potato airfryer about 375 for like 20-ish minutes probably than that but I'll keep an eye on them good yeah 10 ounces potato okay and then for toppings I'm gonna do sugar-free ketchup and mustard what are you doing  what are you doing are you working so have you told YouTube about my stuff clothes in the next few weeks on MPC so yeah I wanna be seen well a lot of my clients say it's pretty good because a lot of them aren't competing a lot of right 12 weeks our 14 or 20 you know later on so I only had two clients that were competing in about seven weeks so obviously those shows are cancelled up until May 10th so what are you doing with those clients that are sure sooner yeah I mean I told one of my clients that we're taking a diet break right now honestly it's better like for these people because you just have more time now uh-huh so there's always a positive like there's more time now I'm actually pumped about it like and then a diet break is perfect are you saying alright yeah yeah I'm still prepping here just because I don't know your show wasn't going to be now I feel is not the next six seven weeks so right now I'm just going to continue party because I don't know this thing could be over in two weeks or it could be over in in eight weeks from now so we're gonna continue because I can I can so do my cardio and so that traffic I'm sure so what happens if they close the gym for two weeks what are you gonna do that's gonna be fine we could do that home workouts I can get some good some good full-body workouts using the band's piles ant as a home gym my cousin has a small home gym yeah we can definitely make it work even with my clients right now meanwhile just broke up this really great full-body when's your next photo time and then okay I was trying to be attained my or I'm at right now we might do a diet break for Lauren for next week or something like that but we'll see we'll see you know we're just taking a day-by-day right now I know a lot of people are kind of stressed out and I was stressed out but now I'm just like okay I don't think I just really do not think this is going to be lasting more than three months I mean come on I think we've in the next eight weeks this whole thing should be okay but yeah I mean Kyle and I already booked all of our stuff for our shows you booked everything who booked a hotel we booked a flight so I mean obviously we're praying for the best we're bunny trucks goodbye but you know it's sad like I want to compete in these shows and hopefully they don't old but if they do the motors compete in June show was later in the summer well that's when we're planning on doing shows anyway so later in the summer so it's all good yeah so if you're prepping right now I totally understand they're coming from if you got a show if you're here if you have a show then actually yeah if you have a show in the next four to seven weeks and you're already really really lean start doing a diet break or slowly tapering up and kind of get a grasp of how you're responding to that go reverse diet behind intuition yeah I'm doing a diet break for my client there's a show in four weeks and it's cancelled so now she used to wait until May so it's fine she can do a diet break and then get leaner shortly enough anyone you know if you want help with an at-home workout we made one so direct might suggest our comment below we get send it to is if you're our client it's on our Facebook group for our clients put your you know I already use you know yeah that's what I mean yeah my potatoes are cooking okay oh you're dead what up guys so it is March 17th right now and so I got up this morning and I checked my phone and my gym it still was still open I follow them on my Facebook so I woke up this morning I I did my cardio I just got back from cardio so I did that took a shower now I'm about to eat my first meal but yeah my gym is still open so I'm praying that it stays open if not you know I can still make it work with doing you know at home workouts and stuff but that's that's awesome that it's still open so hopefully it stays open I know a lot of people right now live in the United States I know I have some clients that their gyms are completely shut down you know clients that with in New York and Colorado just other other states but for some reason I guess here in Florida you know where I'm following like st. Pete area a lot of the gyms are still open I have two memberships want another gym that I have it's still open they're just like having a cap on the amount of time you can be in there like an hour so yeah what we're just gonna see I'm just gonna take it obviously day by day here but I'm still prepping guys I'm still prepping okay I'm gonna keep going through with this and so I'm about to make my first meal here I am back on my low days now yesterday and the day before I had two back-to-back refeed days but yeah now it's back to the grind now back on those low calories so the show just must go on okay so yeah   what up so it is dinnertime now and I thought I would show you what I'm having for dinner what I am looking up here it's not my last meal of the day my last meal of the day is like a little treat meal that I do a little sweet meal but right now this is dinner so I'm gonna show you what I have a whuppin up to here here it is I haven't added any seasoning on here yet which I'm going to but what it is is a serving of this simply potatoes it's hashbrowns I like this brand because it has less sodium in it sometimes like that alexia brand has a lot of sodium so there's zero fat there's 15 carbs and two protein and there's only 55 milligrams of sodium in one serving here which is 83 grams so I mix that with only a hundred grams of cauliflower rice here so yeah that's what I'm doing right now and then I'm obviously gonna throw in some I'm gonna make up some chicken as well and a salad but yeah this is my meal number four okay so in terms of dinner here's what you got going on I have salad and then I put some cheese because I had some more fact macros so I just ended up putting a slice of cheese on top of the hash brown the cauliflower and the chicken right there so four ounces of chicken cheese and there we go this is what I'm doing for my last meal here this is this obviously helps my sweet tooth I was dieting - why are you dieting why are you dieting front foot prep okay yeah potatoes after 70 carbs - 330 a day
