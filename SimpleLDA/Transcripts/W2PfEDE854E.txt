 oh my gosh guys today we're gonna be doing my corona virus quarantine routine I figured what better first video to put on this vlog channel then something facilitating the panic of the current I'm just kidding I'm not trying to fill the taint the panic but I figured I would show you guys how I'm handling the quarantine what I'm doing I live in upstate New York Buffalo area for those of you who are wondering I'm kind of hoping that this video gets a lot of views from around the world so that I can see what's going on in other places when you guys comment so today is what like March 20th or something like that it's Friday so this has been our first full week of like official government-sanctioned like can't go to work kind of thing I'm gonna be taking guys with me for some things that I actually do have to leave the house for today um but just to let you know like stuff I've been doing inside um I put together this piece of furniture from Ikea I have like this ugly ugly thing so I wanted to you know get anyone so I put that together I also bought another piece of furniture the Alex 9 drawers for my bathroom but I haven't put that together yet that's still sitting here on the floor I completely cleaned my filming station and then trying to clean my apartment because it's like what else is there to do this is toilet paper that I ordered online involved because it's all sold out everywhere and I actually didn't have any so and it was mad expensive too I'm gonna have to meal prep later today but the best part about this whole thing I totaled my car on Monday on my way to work so today I think the second thing I'm gonna do as soon as we leave the house is go to the collision shop and get all of my stuff out of my car because it is totaled and I got to get my stuff out of it I did get a rental car I'll show you that when we go outside I have a couple of errands to run and I'm just gonna show you guys how I been living my life I did my makeup solely for the purpose of this video I'm obviously not wearing makeup during the quarantine because I'm not going anywhere and I'm not doing anything all right I will be back when we're in the car and we'll talk more okay so the first thing that I actually have to do is pick up a package from the post office and I think it's the craziest thing that they're making me do this instead of just dropping on off they're like oh it requires a signature I'm like you know what damn Crone virus like can you give me a break or give yourself a break because you think I wouldn't want people coming in I forgot to show you my rental car I'm going to show it to you when I get out at the collision shop I love the Rhino car it's a Ford Fusion and I've never had a backup camera I've never had any of these luxuries because I Drive a 2007 Chevy Equinox SUV I'm in love with this car and I love the way that my camera fits there too it's super nice and it's such a cheap car to I could buy one but oh my camera doesn't fall please don't fall please just I don't have time for that um I could but I'm like screaming sorry I could buy one but I want a Dodge Challenger and I'm very specific in the cars that I want and to spend money on and I want a not challenger so I'm either going to get one or I'm going to buy my grandma's used car from her for like nothing and then continue saving money and depends on whatever I decide to do but I do really love this car and I love the space because the Dodge Challenger doesn't have this much space in it why yeah I do really like the space I don't know I have a lot of thinking to do maybe I'll just take my grandma's car and go from there so they've had more time to think I'm sorry it's like a dark right now it's so nice outside I'm you know it's so crazy with this whole virus thing going on because it's really like kind of depressing so for people who struggle from anxiety and depression which I do it makes things a lot more difficult because you can't see your friends you all of the Sun events take that plan I had a spring break vacation in Miami I had to cancel I had a concert and all of my friends from back home were coming up I had to cancel that and it's just really it's not easy so I'm working from home so I'm a middle school counselor so working from homes almost impossible you know I'm answering emails checking my we found a way to answer like check our voicemails from our cell phones like our work voicemails things like that but there's only there's limitations to what we can offer our families as counselors and students during this quarantine so that's difficult and then I'm trying to figure out the master schedule which I've never done before and now that I can't be in the building and stuff there's limited health so I have to like make some appointment over the phone was like a BOCES to do that so that's difficult that's the what work is looking like and then other than that I mean this just happened I don't even know what the routine is gonna look like to pick up the sting package I'm trying to like okay I'm gonna park right here because the Lighting's a little bit better this car is so nice in like the parental think it's like a little button down here off to show it to you a little while it's like you just twist it like this it's not like this literally a button that you just twist I decide but I'm at the post office I have like this lip and you know what's even more depressing about this when I'm picking up is literally an outfit that was for my Miami vacation that's what this is so that's depressing too I'm gonna try to leave book vacations for summer because I expect this to be at least manageable by summer and if it's not manageable by summer screw it I mean oh my god so let me go grab my thing from the post office I'll be right back oh my gosh my hair is all messed up it's so windy outside so I'm just gonna open my package because why not  music started playing I don't want to get copyrighted here um so like I said this is one of my outfits for Miami hopefully we'll go I was never able to go and pick it up until now and they weren't able to return to sender either because of everything so that's good so this is the top can you guys even see I know that the lining is so not great it's a fringy top it's so cute and it actually feels super stretchy and better quality than I was expecting so I'm happy about that and me and my best friend Heather both got the same thing in different colors because we wanted to like match you know um so hers I think is a mauve color so here's the bottoms it's shorts with fresh all over from back super cute I think it's gonna fit I got a size 4 I'm excited well whenever and then I got some exciting let me first of all see I'm not used to driving such a nice car like it doesn't vibrate or like making the waves or anything so I'm like is it off and it's not off I'm gonna try to get a better angle to like face the Sun yeah no I can sit here for a second it just got better I wanted to tell you about my car accident so I was on my way to work and the highway on my way to work is 65 miles an hour so everyone's going like 70 75 I go like 58 60 because I'm always early to work and I don't want to get there like mad early so I Drive a little bit slower but that has nothing to do with anything because I was still driving like just like five under the speed limit or I was just going 65 right that's a speed limit and a guy behind me rear-ended me on the Thruway I don't know how fast he was going I'd say probably at least 70 my back still hurts so he rear-ended me out of nowhere I didn't even see him coming hit me from behind total both of our cars he was a kid like 18 from out of state driving home from college in Buffalo to Wisconsin because of the coronavirus so was not a good day for him either even though it was his fault you know it was not a good day for him either he did get a ticket it was 100% his fall 0% mine I had to go through my insurance though because he's out of state and it would have taken forever so I had to go through my insurance pay my $500 deductible which they will fight to get back and I had to pay for my own rental car because I don't have rental insurance so they told me they can submit submit receipts for my rental car but there's no guarantees so I got this rental car until Sunday which is in two days I've had it for a week and I paid for that and then my parents are actually gonna drive up here and give me my mom's car because my mom is retired this is such a local like it's so crazy so my mom drives a Dodge Charger so that'll be fun to drive um they're dropping that off for me and I'm gonna drive that until I either get my grandma's car cuz my girls on vacation or until I buy a new one so they totaled out the value of my card a little bit over $4,000 which for you know my cars for 2007 it had 230 thousand miles on it I'm happy with that that's fine it was in good condition I had all other seats sunroof heated seats - had everything so even though it was an old car had everything at the time it was bought you know what I mean so anyways my I had back in neck injuries but the actuaries all came back clear and they told me just to kind of monitor it so what I'm gonna do I need to put that colors and shop in my GPS and we'll get moving you okay so Oh they've got it um this is kind of annoying I wanted to show you guys the damage on my car but they've got it like turned backwards and all of the damages in the back and it's right up on that gate so I'm not even gonna be able to show you the hug okay well I guess I'm just gonna get my stuff out of it and then I'll show you my rental car after I guess start or anything either so this was my car I came and took everything out of it this is my rental car I love it it's a like I said it's a Ford Fusion it is so windy outside I can't deal I'm gonna do one last look and make sure I got everything out of it I guess I'm gonna have to get a new like suction cup because this keeps falling off the windshield was just really annoying um so the cars taken care of I got all of my things out of the car they said I could leave anything I didn't want which is convenient so the cars totaled it's done like I said I'll be driving my mom's car after I give this rental back and then I either I'm gonna buy a new one or I'm gonna buy my grandma's off her and then save to buy a new better new one that's better than I can afford I guess I might try to go grocery shopping oh I literally have been avoiding the stores just because it's just annoying you know what oh no I do have bag okay um I have a reusable bag because New York made the reusable bag law where you can't use plastic bags anymore it's like now is not the time okay um but it's actually easier grocery shopping with that because you can more and one reusable bag then you can in like three plastic bags so I'm actually okay with it um so I think I might go back to the island get groceries and then that's it cuz like they can't do anything else I might film the boxycharm video back at the house um I don't know I have a regular channel so I have a regular channel but I wanna just start a vlog channel de and my hope is that the vlog Channel will be my main source of YouTube what's going on here um but I feel like I make my money off of the other channel so I need to keep it going until this one takes off if this one takes off so anyways cuz I know I just threw this random vlog out there I figured though that like the whole coronavirus thing would be a good way to start a new channel um hopefully to get some news and some people please hit subscribe if this video happens to do well when people are actually watching that please hit subscribe and thumbs up I'd be so happy um my dream is to have a vlog channel that I can live off of and just you know make vlogs and not have to only do sit-down videos because I just love to vlog um so hit subscribe and in the meantime I don't know I guess I'm gonna try to go get groceries and OH
