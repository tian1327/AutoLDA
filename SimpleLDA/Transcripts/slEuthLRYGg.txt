 hey guys it's Amanda and welcome back to the quarantine vlogs I am so excited to be back and finally vlogging again I finally feel like I have a purpose and a weird son the reason for the delay was because of this bad boy right here this bed it took so long to come in and I'm so annoyed about it but I'm obsessed with it so it was kind of worth it guys I've been sleeping on my couch for the past five days if that's not evident right now and I actually slept on my couch last night and really uncomfortable I'm finally glad that I can sleep on my bed on my mattress but it's super cute it's from Haines you know don't make the mistake I did and just order the headboard cuz I had to return the headboard and then ordered the whole bed all over again it was a nightmare but it's finally built it's finally here I'm so happy with it and yet you guys so I had an early start to my day I basically brushed my teeth popped on some contacts and I just cleaned a little bit because the house was a little messy and I didn't want like to vlog with the messy house so yeah we're gonna go ahead and make breakfast now alright guys so these are the ingredients for today's it green smoothie I'm gonna put some green apples in there a celery tumeric actual tumeric which I've never used in my smoothies just the powder so I'm excited to see how this is ginger apple cider vinegar a tablespoon of matcha or a teaspoon really small amount and a lemon banana collagen powder some spinach some kale and some celery of course and a cup of water  so for breakfast I'm gonna make some scrambled eggs with a little bit of cheese and ripped-up turkey broth so I'm just gonna put this all in this bowl I'm just gonna pop this on there look at some cheese and mix it up so I also went ahead and got some mandarins I got two mandarins peeled them and that's gonna be my breakfast for the day the green smoothie ginger shot some lemon water I also eat my a quick touch-up stone no not everyone does that but that's just how I eat them guys ginger shot time I probably should have taken this before breakfast oops oh my god oh I'm the hatch guys help as well I'm gonna finish this up I made it a super thick today I feel like I still have like the other half so I think I'm just gonna drop the gunk of it and just drink like the actual liquid guys so I'm just hanging out here I'm listening to music I'm probably gonna play a little bit of guitar in a little bit I am just kind of cruising through my music playlist and seeing what song I want to learn on there I finally got my strings and was able to fix my guitar so I can play and now I've been playing it for the past couple of days and it's been really fun and it's been awesome but I am really rusty and I'm trying to get my calluses back on my hands so this is definitely a little painful but I really am excited to get back into it and I love music I love singing I love playing guitar I was supposed to start my vocal lessons again but obviously because of kovat I can't see my vocal teacher and you know it's just something to pass the time and something that I can you know focus on is realistically if this wasn't going on right now I probably would have never done this and fixed my guitar so I'm glad that this is pushing me to you know do things that I've always wanted to do yeah I'm just gonna hang out here for a little bit and I'll touch base when I'm doing something else I've never really played for anyone before um I've been playing guitar for a really long time please don't judge me I'm super rusty I haven't played in months like really close to a year it literally hurts me to play right now because my fingers aren't used to it anymore like I said I'm not a musician I'm not like a singer I just like to sing four five I've had really bad confidence issues with my voice for a really long time and I'm finally getting out of that she'll and yeah please just don't don't leave any like negativity about this because I do this for fun yeah this is just something I like I've never shown this side of me to YouTube so I hope you guys like it we're rusty you know we're getting back to like the easy basics  scared  I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations oh my friends are turning green you're the magician's assistant in the dreams  and make size ticking away through the dark side I wanna be your man I love you when you singing that song and I got a lump in my throat cause you're gonna sing the words my voice is super a speak but that's how you're getting it I haven't played in a really long time so please don't be hard on me I don't even know why I'm doing this I'm so scared but I I just kind of felt like I should yeah I just felt like doing that I haven't played this bad boy in so long look at my fingers y'all they're super irritated they're like super swollen because I haven't played in so long I have to build the calluses up again sorry I'm like when I played the chords they were a little streaky I don't have that much strength in my fingers anymore so it really hurts when I apply a lot of pressure onto the strings and these strings are killer so but yeah I'm gonna go ahead and get ready for the day I haven't done my makeup or anything I've just kind of been chilling at home but we're gonna do some quick little makeup I'm posting and everyday makeup routine sometime soon so I know you guys want more in depth and makeup looks in the vlogs which I will do but this is like really simple  this is the finished makeup look just really simple it's like my literal everyday makeup and it's Cinco DeMayo today so I'm gonna make some tacos for lunch I'm super excited for them and yeah we're just gonna gonna head start on though hey guys so I'm gonna make some pressed juice before lunch so I'm gonna make my tumeric carrot orange ginger basically vitamin C extravaganza and I'm just gonna pop this in the press juicer that I got on Amazon and yeah I don't have a huge like pitcher so I have to like put it in different cups but yeah   hello so first things first that e Cinco DeMayo we're gonna make some tacos this is my famous taco recipe that I have been making for the longest time now I promise you I'm not even hyping this up people literally come over just for this and it's a crowd favorite I am missing one of the ingredients which is a bell pepper because it expired and it wasn't my fridge so I thought I had it but I don't but I do have an onion 1/2 avocado I got you know all the good alright so this is what you're gonna need taco seasoning mix I mix the mild an original cuz I don't like them too spicy you're needing an onion you need some avocado salt and pepper ground beef onion powder tomato sauce sour cream and cheese and tortillas and these are the ones that I like personally they yeah  we're gonna take some olive oil medium heat and put that in not too much all right so I like my seasonings I'm CUBAN you know my mother raised me too overseas in my food basically my mom taught me to always seasoned very well and some salt and pepper honest I'm gonna put our original taco seasoning in there too we're basically going to mix this is why I said to take off like your rings and stuff because this gets messy I love what I'm talking as if I was doing a makeup tutorial we're gonna blend and yeah that's seasoned I'm gonna wash my hands really quick okay now we're gonna pop in our onion and we're gonna pan through these for a little bit like two minutes three minutes until they're like a little lighter and clearish so I put the meat in it's been cooking for a little bit I haven't put anything else in now I'm gonna pop in the tomato sauce and I feel like some people think this is super weird but trust me this just elevates the flavor of the meat okay so the meat is cooked so we're gonna get started on our guacamole so we have some avocados it's fine if they look like that I also cut up some onion and some tomatoes I'm just gonna mix this all in here okay guys I'm also squeezing in half the lime in here and I'm just gonna mix this all in nice and launched was expired because I'm terrible and I didn't check but really good for the tacos I'm on the phone with Christine say hi Christine  Christine is only Cinco DeMayo companion okay I just put the tortillas over the stove and I'm gonna flip them in like 30 seconds and get them nice and crispy too you know basically set up the taco all right guys so there is done so I'm just gonna place it over the tortilla no I think this is good it's just me so I'm gonna grab the clock that we made and place that on top now we're gonna grab some sour cream and cheese all right this parts optional but it's an essential for my tacos visit we're gonna crunch these up and put them on top it's like a powdered flavoring it just makes it a little spicy gives it a kick and it's really yummy and there you have it guys super yummy happy Cinco de Mai yo and this is the pressed juice we made it's pretty good I wouldn't have the grapefruit again just because I feel like I made it super bitter but it is super YUM haven't had my cockroach in so long wow wow they came up so good you guys just came out ten out of ten if you guys end up making these tag-me because they're fire and let me know how much you like them because they're amazing ignore the kitchen in the background it's a disaster I have to clean it I don't know why all of a sudden I just crashed and I'm super tired I also did only sleep five hours last night I just didn't want to sleep in I'm trying to fix a sleep schedule you know it's a struggle I'm going to pick out a book to read because I've pretty much finished all of them you see I have a bunch of books that I just haven't read okay I think we're gonna start damsel I've had this book forever and I haven't read it it sounds really interesting basically the part of this is basically like when the King dies in this Kingdom the prince has to go slay a dragon and you know rescue the damsel in distress which is this girl who's gonna be the princess basically but this girl is basically kidnapped and she has no recollection of her past or how she got to that Tower and she's stuck there and I guess he has to rescue her and you know we'll find out I'll keep you guys updated on the book when I read for a little bit probably take a quick little nap also I'm so tired I feel like I'm just really worn out from like doing that Beyonce dance for literally two hours I'm not kidding I tried to do it again and refill my was like my hair like this super cutie y'all go like my little savage remix Beyonce dances because I worked hard on them I took talk as a manatee as I put here yeah I'm gonna read this book a little bit and taken up because I'm really tired guys I just woke up from a nap it's like 11:00 oh my god I'm still gonna keep the vlog going even though it's like 11:00 I'm gonna stay off because I fell asleep for like five hours which I don't understand how that happened but maybe I think it's the fact that I haven't slept in a bed in like five days and I'm sleep-deprived I've been sleeping on this couch for the past couple of days and it just has a minute for my sleep but I'm gonna take my makeup off I think because I feel disgusting right now and then I'll just come back wow I look crazy right now like actually crazy but so I already washed my face and use this before in the vlogs this is the Kate sever milk goat milk moisturizing cleanser this is great because it doesn't strip your skin from like the moisture it has and I'm going to use a Paula's Choice omega-3 complex serum this is amazing it has chia in it and it has flaxseed it's super moisturizing I have really dry skin I cannot believe I took enough in my makeup like that's so Wow cuz okey I was like hmmm I might not take enough I'll like read a little bit and I literally like read like two chapters of that book and I dozed off I was not expecting that I take the top to do a skin cream this stuff is amazing this is literally my lazy girl skincare right now but it's still skin care you gotta take care of your skin I'm taking this the recipe of akkad amount retinol i sleeping last and last but not least the grande lash md lash enhancing serum this stuff works you guys it's amazing you guys it's insane how fast my lashes have grown and they're so long and healthy hey guys so I wasn't going to talk about this it's like a weird t-money kind of situation but I've been a birth control over like two years it helps me regulate my period as this condition called other stall nose syndrome it's called EDS it's something I've lived with my entire life and it's something that hasn't really affected my life and like a really intense way but I have a thinner blood than like the normal human and I have hyperelasticity in my joints and basically like a lack of collagen which makes my skin almost rubber like and that's why I'm super flexible and I can do this weird thing with my arms that I might show you guys I can basically like grab my thing and like just bring it all the way up I'm not gonna do it because like that literally like a freak people out I've been on two different birth controls they're kind of the same generic it's like ortho cyclin and then I got on spring tech and when I first got on it I just remember having the worst mood swings and it literally just drove me insane I didn't experience the side effects I'm experiencing now which is weird got on it for the first time in three weeks today and I'm feeling these side effects right now I look them up cuz I never looked up the spring tech ones and oh my god queasiness and like vomiting and headaches you're like the major like side effects to it I really hope I don't throw up I don't think I am the nah just kind of passing I just have a really bad headache and I don't have tylenol on me right now and I can't take Advil because it didn't stop my blood and it's really bad for me and I learned that through my henna the-- stop you know these vlogs are like something new for me I'm just being really open and vulnerable and saying is how I feel I can't just pretend I'm not feeling this way and like cook for you guys and act like I'm fine I literally feel like  right now but I don't want this day to go to waste because I know how I am the vlog isn't up to my standards I'm not going to post it so I just wanted to be wonderful with you guys this vlog definitely it's like me opening up a lot more but yeah I'm sorry that I'm talking so much but I'm trying to clean up the kitchen from the taco mess I made because I never cleaned it up and I feel sick I'm gonna try and clean it up and I'm probably just going to cut up some fruit and eat that because I feel like if I eat dinner dinner I'm gonna feel worse I'm sorry I was gonna cook again for you guys but I guess I'll do it in the next vlog but yeah I'm gonna try and clean up the kitchen I'm drinking some water that's like not super cold or anything because my stomach feels sensitive um yeah we're just need some fruit because I feel gross right now hey guys so I'm cutting up some fruit and I'm gonna like take off these pomegranate seeds I'm on the phone uh hey honey shehas helping me feel better I honestly don't feel like eating a super like full dinner I feel really gross right now I need something light so I'm just gonna cut up some fruit and like I think that'll be good but you know I'm just gonna cut this up to like this you're both gonna throw up or not and it's not happening so I'm gonna brush my teeth and try and just sleep this off like I feel horrible I'm sorry that this vlog was not what you guys might have expected for me I was not expecting this either no birth control is kind of like a weird to have to a subject that people don't like to talk about and I personally didn't want to talk about it just because like I know how people might take it but I genuinely like take it for my condition so which is something I also want to talk about on my youtube channel I've thought that ehlers-danlos my whole life it just basically it's affected me in a weird way like I bruise easier like literally the slightest thing can bruise me like my cuts don't fully heal like if I do injure myself like these scars on my forehead I don't know you guys can see it I do have a scar here in here I've broken my head like twice in Cuba and it's definitely something I've lived with my whole life like if I were to get surgery in the future like my doctors need to know like I can't do unnecessary like dumb surgeries because my skin like cannot take it one thing I've always wanted to do is fix my nose oh my god I'm really getting into it but one thing I've always wanted to do is fix my nose I have a really deviated septum and I just never really fully liked my nose if I'm being honest and in the future it's something that I've considered doing but because of the risks that would come with surgery with my condition like it's just something that I've been battling with back and forth cuz I don't know if I'm fully gonna go through with it but I wouldn't do anything else because it's unnecessary you know what I mean gonna floss I totally killed the vibe for this vlog I am so sorry I'm really sorry this logged in and the way that we all expected I didn't expect this ending either hopefully I can sleep this off I'm not feeling my best obviously but we all have our days good and bad so I'm showing you guys everything the good days of quarantine the bad days of quarantine
