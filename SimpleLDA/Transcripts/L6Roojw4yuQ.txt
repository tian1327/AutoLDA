 hey guys pragmatic prepper here just checking in for day four installment of my coronavirus series today was a little bit interesting decided to go into town see how things were go for a walk it was very eerie as I stated in the last couple of videos all the bars and restaurants are closed you could still get takeout but the entire like main strip of town just had signs that all just said curbside pickup only he's really weird I saw I saw a couple trying to get into one of the restaurants like asking if they were open I'm just like it's it's pretty pretty common knowledge if you've been awake for the last week that nothing's open so I just kind of laughed at that maybe they were from out of town or tours or something but this isn't the kind of area that you would be you know visiting on vacation or something like that but anyway I thought that was interesting but it was creepy to see everything sort of shut down that way took some notes for myself again because throughout the day I was just making some observations the other thing was they talked about the social distancing everyone was really really far apart from each other which suits me just fine I don't like people getting all that close to me anyway but it was it was as if like they were back sides of a magnet like you could see people and they would pass yourself there weren't many people out to begin with but you could see people when you'd pass someone on the street they would you know sort of veer out of the way which is just really really weird and my buddies have come to join me again so that was that was interesting come on bud come on this is it's my buddy red red dad's making a video it's making a video sorry about that one of the one of the latest developments is a lot of people I shouldn't say latest but a lot of people have obviously been getting laid off but people close to me are there at currently at 50% which is what the governor mandates sort of was but there's a lot of people that are potentially losing their jobs completely which is going to affect me and the people around me rather dramatically I know the government's talking about some stimulus packages and whatnot I'm not sure that my profession is going to qualify me for that without getting into too much detail so that's not great as I said business is better very slow it continues to be slow the post office is moving slowly a lot of packages are getting mis-sent or just held up in general so that's frustrating I understand it but it's it's frustrating and like I said a lot of online retailers have been you are paying have been holding funds Amazon now is only doing deliveries for essential things they're not doing anymore non-essential deliveries at this time as I said II Bay is effectively you know customer service and everything is closed it's just crazy so I've been dealing with that as well what is someone that's you know an entrepreneur and small business owner self-employed this this is hitting me hard financially and like I said I'm not sure that this stimulus stuff is actually gonna do me any good I don't believe in the government doing that anyway I'm just gonna put that out there I also don't believe in government mandating that businesses need to shut down so on one hand I don't think they should do that on the other hand I do understand that if they do sort of impose sanctions on businesses they should be liable to compensate them so in on that and I do understand that but you know as far as things like in the passive bailouts and stimulus packages and one on stuff like that I don't support that so I'm gonna make that very clear I've had some socialists commenting on my videos talking about how socialism would be better if you want to test if you want to test run for socialism take things how they are now and multiply that by 10 and that's every day for you okay so thumbs up double thumbs up to you guys out there who think socialism Marx it doesn't and I do have friends who lived in formerly socialist countries and they're here for a reason so I'm talking to you guys if this is the channel where you think I might support something like that if you think this is that channel it's not you're out that you're on the wrong channel so you can keep watching it helps me and when you comment and engage it just increases my engagement I don't you know I don't mind it I just think it's funny so but I'm also very cognizant of the fact that I shouldn't feed the trolls but I'm currently feeding them so next in line I visited with my sibling yesterday before I before I visited with him I talked to him about if he had been in any sort of contact with the close person I've talked about that is currently in quarantine and he hadn't been in contact with that person since February so then I allowed myself to be in contact with him and his children the person in quarantine is doing fine his his wife and kids tested negative which I think it's really weird that he lives with them and they all tested negative so that's a little bit odd to me not gonna go much more into that I'm just gonna let you think what you want to think about that whole situation but he had he's in a business that he travels quite a bit and he's been to some of the affected areas so I was stopped in his stores a look at some you know what was available people watch a little bit they were rationing toilet paper and and water and whatnot there was tons of water available camp fruit still pretty much gone 12 paper where they were handing out to like packages per person if you wanted to buy it so all the stores are doing that but at least supplies are getting through for now so that's a plus the more people that are supplied the less panic there is so that's a good it's a good sign I don't know if anyone else has noticed this but the Internet and phone service has been really slow I kind of expected that the Internet's been slow for a while now phone service has been really really slow for me the last week or so it's probably the server's being overloaded saying probably with the internet my phone also went froze yesterday for a few hours I actually had to bring it to the store the cell store to have them rebooted cuz it wasn't even that I wasn't rebooting I was glad they were open because not having your cell phone and a time like this is not great I mean I can certainly do without it but I'd rather not as far as keeping in contact with people and doing things like this and all my money and business stuff is is accessible on my phone so that was not fun I went to check on ammo everything in any type of common pistol cartridge you can possibly imagine is gone there's no nine-millimeter there's no 45 there's no 40 38 anything like that there's some odd calibers out there but nothing that you would see people carrying so those of you who have odd calibers are in luck actually shotgun ammo there was there was some stuff available but the out like all the buckshot was gone which I understand people use that for home defense you know some people do know 556 obviously no AR stuff just none but you know I that's expected a lot of Tony til have 22 is available tons of it which i think is funny because that was always the thing that was like I'm complete shorts but there was actually a lot of 22 available so I didn't need any but I wanted to check see how things were there were rumors about Governor Cuomo possibly banning the sale of ammunition that hasn't happened it might happen but it hasn't happened New York City so it still hasn't shut down so we'll see I hope I'm wrong about all that out that doesn't happen I don't be I don't like predicting things and having them be true I'd rather none of this stuff happened I'm I'm not one of those people that hopes for you know in shtf for a reset button or anything like that and those of you out there call for that stuff time you don't know what you're getting into and you wouldn't have it we'll just we'll just leave that there not much else to update I'm doing alright I feel better than yesterday yesterday which is really rundown tired still kind of tired but I feel set pretty much set with where things are at now and I'm looking forward to doing some other stuff video wise in the future if time allows if situations allow for all of you out there who have been waiting for my video my roast video I'm going to get there eventually I'm gonna be doing a roast in light fun of a couple of my favorite channels Canadian proper practices proper prepared mind and a couple others so I'm going to do a roast video of them so keep updated or you know keep keep checking back for that but like I said I'm gonna do this every day and I hope you guys are all well and stay safe and I will do the same pragmatic prepper out
