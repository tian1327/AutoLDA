 what is going on everybody welcome back to my channel today we are joined with a very special guest once again my lovely wife Antony Anna today we're going to be talking about what it's like to move to New York City in the middle of the koban 19 coronavirus pandemic so let's get into it  so we're gonna begin with this video with the reason why we're actually moving to New York City before we start this video make sure you watch all the way till the end because you may see a sneak preview of our apartment as most of you already know I'm originally from there and Michael matched his fellowship back in New York so it's that time of the year and we're heading back home so I'll be heading back to New York in the next couple of weeks and Michael will be coming there at the end of the month I have my orientation at in the middle of June but I wanted to get our apartment set up before my job and as well as the for Michael gets into town yeah it's really nice actually because I have to stay here till the end of June almost and she starts her job before me which means she'll be moving up and also means she'll be driving my mom crazy with helping me set up my apartment yeah I don't have to do I don't know how I lucked out I'm not having to do any unpacking but okay I promise you I'm doing my fair share in the packing process so he thinks so now that you know why we're moving to New York let's talk about what exactly we were looking for in New York City so living down in North Carolina kind of spoiled us because we were definitely able to get a more luxury apartment for half the price of New York so we have to keep that at least half the price yeah so you definitely have to keep that in mind but in New York City as most of y'all know or if you haven't lived there you really have to kind of pick and choose of what you want because there's a good chance the apartment you're looking for is not going to have everything yeah not not every apartment is going to meet all of your criteria in fact it may miss most of your criteria but you may be able to live without something it's the whole city is essentially like what are you willing to live without right yeah that's like all it is so everybody brings their whole list of things they want in that apartment and then you slowly kind of knock off things that you can live without unless if you don't do that you're going to end up paying like $6,000 for a one-bedroom apartment Billy's which I mean not many people can afford that let's just put it that way so we basically were looking for either a one or two bedroom apartment on the east side of Manhattan yes we wanted to be in Manhattan since both of our jobs are in Manhattan even though we could get something cheaper living in either Queens but really convenience is ideal when it comes to being able to just walk to your job yeah we wanted to be able to walk to work and we wanted something right in the middle or we wanted our apartment to be right in the middle of under the Ana's job and also my job right because we're selling both of our cars in the next few weeks and we'll be walking to work essentially we're taking the subway if we need to but yes so that's another thing that we kind of try to play into apartment hunting is even if we didn't have one of our needs or it didn't meet the criteria it was definitely location was key for us yeah location is everything you want to be close to work because when we first met when I was doing surgery in the Upper East Side at Lenox Hill Hospital I lived literally across the street from the hospital and it was like it was a dream oh this was a dream yes yeah waking up and just rolling out of bed and going into work was everything and especially when I'm in fellowship and going to be on call all the time I wanted to be in close proximity to my hospital so that was kind of big on our list and that was one thing we were not going to settle on so that was our location next was how many batches we wanted we were looking for two bedrooms just to have extra storage space but that also comes with a higher price tag yeah so extra bedroom starts going up really quickly we've lived in a one-bedroom here in the last couple years and it's really no different us moving this one-bedroom to a new one bedroom so we have a little bit more storage space yeah a little more sorceress there I wanted to have a two bedroom for the sake of having my own like YouTube area or studio per se where I could just come after work have everything set up and just start filming but you know again you guys will wholly start chopping off things that you want and things that you can live without the end I told Michael I'll set up the camera for him yeah yeah I will in this new apartment which we'll get to I'll have my own little desk area so that was the compromise yeah that was the compromise it's a one-bedroom with a little extra space so you can put a desk so when it comes to knocking off properties for your apartment search we were looking for essentially a couple of different things we wanted a washer and dryer in unit yes we wanted an elevator building I really wanted a gym in our in our apartment we have one here it's really nice to wake up before work and get a workout in but also in the end kind of saves you money with paying for a gym membership um so yeah if you don't have to pay I mean New York gyms can be pretty expensive you know eighty one hundred eighty two hundred fifty dollars I'm up if you don't have to pay that saves you quite a bit of money the other main thing I didn't want to go that was sunlight natural light yes he was so picky with these windows oh my god natural light is so hard to find in New York City because you know you live in these tall buildings and there's so many buildings around the windows and I just feel like all the apartments are really narrow yeah they just go out and then one like window directly if you think about it Manhattan if you have a southern facing window you did daylight or sunlight throughout the entire 24 hours well throughout the daytime but if you're facing east or west or north you may not get sunlight at all or you may get sunlight you know a little bit of the day or the morning or just the evening or whatnot so I wanted something that had full range of sunlight because it just makes you so much happier having sunlight so I wanted a balcony as well but alas New York City and you got to pay for those balconies so now let's get into how we actually search for our apartment I think I was on street easy for the last two months easily yeah every day every day I hate time today having Michael emails or just as soon as I woke up I would just like scroll through just there any new apartment listings and even when I came home from work or downtime yeah and for those who don't know a street easy is it is basically it's a website but it's also an app the other one that we were looking at is rent Hoppus route read hobb com I'm not sponsored by these people companies at all but we use them when we thought they were really good that you can kind of filter by what size apartment you want all the amenities that you want then as direct contact to the broker who is listening that apartment so we pretty much in this time had to do 100% of everything online and over the phone everything was rich so pretty much even though I had family there I really didn't want anyone going into these apartments and looking for us I just didn't want anyone to be like leave their house if they didn't need to so we were really picky with the layouts the videos that they provided and the pictures just because we knew that we weren't actually going to be able to see them yeah I had this whole big expectation that I was going to take multiple weekend trips yeah I hadn't actually planned I booked yeah we had I wanted to have all these flights booked and I was going to bring you all along on multiple different vlogs New York City like searching for apartments there's going to be super cool super helpful to show everybody what it's like to get an apartment in New York City because it's different from literally anywhere else in the US or world for that matter but then this whole probit Fame kind of hit us and we weren't able to go see any apartment yep so we had to do everything virtually the thing with these New York apartments is there is such a spectrum the range of apartments you get is anything from something in the basement of a floor a building with like dingy no sunlight to a super nice luxury apartment or you may also get a kind of crappy apartment that they may look good in the pictures yeah or like your kitchen is literally a fridge as a stove and one cabinet yeah and that is your kitchen it's also like I'm like I can do that yeah I mean I my first apartment my first one but the one I lived in my intern year yeah the fridge was be saline in the living room basically it was it was the fridge I'm a TV stand so the fridge literally was in my living room yeah but that's just New York so yeah so this is why I was so skeptical about renting virtually even though they sing you all these videos and stuff you can't really look at the baseboards you can't tell the floor is even you can't tell if it's a floor I just need to make sure that it's clean yeah either way it's just like I mean some of these buildings are a hundred plus years old and I mean unless you can see them and lay your eyes on them it's hard to really trust them plus people in New York are always trying to kind of rip you off in a way and everybody's always trying to make a buck in New York off of you so you have to kind of be extra cautious in my opinion so I probably inquired into probably over 200 apartments they like 50 okay I probably inquired into about me like 50 apartments that way yeah and the brokers would email me back I'm going yeah I found this apartment quickly yeah no I found this apartment it was beautiful we want the one that we currently yeah and Michael and the broker reached out to me amazing lady she was so helpful just she just gave me everything I needed right then and there she pretty much didn't beat around the bush or try to trick me into pure straight shooter yeah well you enjoyed that um she also there was also no broker's fee which was another plus of ours or less yeah let's talk about the broker fee so for those of you who haven't rented in Manhattan there's this thing that you have to pay for us sometimes call it a broker fee and what that fee is for still I've yet to discover but it's exorbitantly expensive yeah be up to 15% of your annual rent so I mean you're talking yeah 15% of 40 or $50,000 which is not a small amount or it could be your first month's rent yeah or it could be the first month's rent or it could be one or two months rent yeah and this broker's fee is essentially I don't I don't I really don't know what it's for to be honest with you what I got out of it was essentially the broker is like your leasing agent so here we have our own leasing office that does your contract and everything like that but certain apartment making a commission yeah exactly exactly but in with certain apartments in New York I think these apartments hire brokers to do all the in-between stuff with when it comes to finding the right candidates and just sending all their pictures sending the videos giving them a tour everything that comes with yeah but what I have I have a big problem of this because when we're trying to look for all these apartments virtually we're doing all the legwork essentially looking online street easy finding these apartments we're emailing the broker and all they're doing is sending us either more pictures or a video of the apartment and that's it and then I have to decide if I want to lease or not and then I'm supposed to pay them ten ten thousand dollars for what for emailing me they would video give us the tour like any birthing I know but they don't yeah they would give us the tour but still a tour a tour of worth ten thousand dollars I'm in the wrong business because that's that's crazy money sorry I have strong feelings about this so there are there are multiple apartments that do not have broker's fee brokers fees and that's exactly what we're trying to go after and luckily we found that we were thinking about renting one with a broker's fee but it would have to kind of blow me away for me to just kind of go away ten thousand dollars our current apartment didn't have one but our broker was absolutely amazing we actually did a FaceTime video tour with her voice yeah twice and when we saw that apartment we kind of just like let's book it yeah 100% and there's no broker fee love the apartment love the amenities of the building I love the location of the building and it pretty much had everything we wanted except the in unit washer and dryer so you had to do without I need a washer and dryer but the only reason I did that is because they have a ton of like brand new the laundry room is kind of right next door to the gym so I'm like wicked yeah I'm like okay maybe we can drop below and yeah so yeah so we ended up finding a nice one-bedroom apartment having almost everything we needed and we are super excited about it she moves up first I move up afterwards and now since you made it this far in the video I'll show you a little sneak peek about water apartment looks like and then maybe we'll give a little apartment or when it's actually put there yeah and then I that's what I want to do as soon as we're broke there I want to do a full apartment tour let me know in the comments below if you guys want to see that or are interested in it yeah I'll show it to you once we get in and move in and get settled so I want to show it to you all it's beautiful so here's a little sneak peek and you'll see the rest later huh  so
