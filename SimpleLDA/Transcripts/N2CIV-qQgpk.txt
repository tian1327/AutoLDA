  whirring oh it was really safe I'm basically a personal trainer now I've started running hmm and use for any meter sprint intervals withdrawing in between and hill sprints hi we're back and sweaty ER and redder than ever that's good though howdy how's it going I showered and got somewhat ready for the day I figured I would do a little like very chill isolation vlog of sorts I keep catching myself watching other people's Quarantine vlogs and I find them quite soothing to watch I'm at a time like this and so I'm thinking you know what I'd make one obviously quite mellow here I'm not doing a whole lot but just some like wholesome things at home I'm gonna be donating all the proceeds from this video to a Red Cross or an effort to hopefully help a little bit let me know moving forward what types of videos you want to see in isolation because I think I'm gonna be here a lot longer in California than I originally anticipated so we're here for the long haul I clean up a little bit get some work done and come along     I got something very exciting oh I'm scared you're screwed on it okay I will disinfect after so basically I made a bit of a semi rash decision so many of the things I do I base off their level of productivity I do things based on like the end goal and how productive it will allow me to be in the future I have like four or five months at home which is what it's looking like it's gonna be like what's a skill I've always wanted to pick up but I probably wouldn't pick up in like a normal day-to-day routine and not for me has always been electric guitar I love rock all types of rock classic in the surf rock Thrasher all the things and my dream is to just it's to shred I freakin love to shred a bottle as a guitar and I know this gonna take me like years to get decent at but I have zero experience with guitar absolutely none so we're really starting from scratch here and I hate being bad at things but you know this is gonna be a really good exercise how cute is she all right now it's time for my most important task of the day this actually takes place maybe a couple times each day but it's important that I cross this off my uterus daily and that is to annoy the living hell out of my sister lets go frankerz hey I feel like I've progressed to age 50 which makes me like 10 this is a horrible position for me okay sister Q&A okay well no one else is squished what spill tea a lot of Heber was born on November 11 she's more in Paris France truth be told everyone says she was a terrible baby moved back from France give me some airplane wings we flew back here to dock and then her life changed on June 3rd 2001 when an angel from above took form and she saw a little red baby and she was like wow mr. girl has been changed my life then I like I went to a few different private schools some home schooling we moved to Florida for a year that was random and then we moved back to Southern California you know she made it through middle school and then she did basketball her freshman year at a little tough not the move she did cross country your sophomore year her senior of high school her fame began on its when she created a fan account for Jane to a university that she didn't love so she was bored and she started a YouTube channel and then she didn't like her school so she dipped went to Paris for a year and then she went with Alma and then blogged her surfer skater life way didn't three and a half years smart girl mags uh Combe something very smart lady and then she was like screw California New York here I come although her accomplishments may seem great she gotta forget but the most important day of her life was June 3rd 2001 when this lunch even came to be oh there we go mission accomplished       hey buddy what is kanye west's correct there are families between the 18 offsetting all combinations with carbon savings what is free sorry the correct response is what is neutral let's see what's in store after this many laps we'll call it a mine even though we'll be 30 feet short excellent  yeah  dad's head recommend watching Ryan shoving ttan on live on Instagram because he posts the most fun live dance session but a lot of people tune in on in their school workouts you lizard people is my favorite kind of easy Wow beautiful  what is up I just realized I wouldn't even back in California I guess for a while now it's been three weeks but I'm like fully regressed to the style that I used to are all the time in California hi die baggy sleeve sweater blue high waisted flare jeans living out my seventies dream what's new figured I'm gonna put on a little bit of makeup because I have my makeup and several days and you know I might feel cute I hope you guys out there have been doing well during this quarantine time it's definitely been like an interesting forced reset I feel like the first two weeks I was quite self indulgent of being like I'm lazy and then I quickly got really bored of it and I'm pretty excited to dive into things that I've been wanting to do hence why I bought the lift a guitar and I've been trying to just like limit my time on screens and focus on jus like kind of just journaling and reflecting in a way that I would never do back in New York cuz I get stuck in the hustle whether that be like a work hustle or even like a social hustle I realized so much of my time was spent or either working or jumping from one social event to another without really taking time for myself to sit back and kind of think about what I want moving forward and I feel like I've really been reevaluating how I want to spend my time once I come out of this been such a reminder how precious our time is how we spend it who we spend it with especially like reevaluating some of my goals moving forward and some of the things I want to do like with this platform create more content around traveling and highlighting different cultures they feel like this past year was incredible but it was a year that was really spent focusing on myself which isn't a bad thing by any means but I've always felt this sound freaking cheesy but I've always had felt this drive to really want to like do something more meaningful and I felt like my life is meant to serve others and to hopefully impact others I've been trying to use this time to kind of figure out like what inspires me and who inspires me and kind of fill my mind with those things rather than just like mindless scrolling what you got is fine and I think it's good to have time off the love watching like people's vlogs I don't do that a lot of times to relax like Jenny or like Amy Lee or Michelle Reed but I've been trying to be very intense with how with where my head spaces at each day when I do let myself kind of dream about the future when things go back to normal how I really want to be intentional with like digging into friendships of people that I really missed and pursuing goals that I may be put to the side because I've been scared to really go for them and I feel like I'm just gonna leave this quarantine period feeling more energized and excited than ever such a weird time I feel weird when I do watch the news I feel weird when I don't watch the news I feel super guilty when I don't work because I'm lucky enough to like have a job online and then another flip side you like what I do can feel so pointless at times and I just tried to buying a balance with that that and I keep hearing your friends losing their jobs it's just so heartbreaking and I know it's so scary for so many people out there right now and my heart goes out to you and I mean it's yeah it's just such an insane time and I know so many people are hurting right now and it's so hard to figure out what to focus on I'm trying to focus on the good cuz there's a lot of things to be grateful for and I'm just yeah trying to maintain a positive outlook but let me know if there's like anything I can do for you guys anything that you'd want to see I want to do more it'll definitely be donating the proceeds of this video what you want to do as many videos as I can but obviously something to like pay for my rap back in New York just another thing I have no idea when I'm going back to New York this is so rambling alright here's the finished look this camera does not pick up makeup well now I'm gonna get some work done  Oh    to head to bed just say goodnight I hope you enjoy these two very random days of my life but that's what I got for you guys right now so thanks so much for watching until next time love you
