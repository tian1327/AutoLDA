 hey guys it's Amanda so I'm back with another quarantine vlog I hope everyone's staying safe and healthy and I keep saying Sain because I know everyone is kind of losing their minds I'm here in my backyard I have been spending some time my parents house because my parents went to their cabin in the mountains in their quarantine there my sister lives in an apartment so she just decided to quarantine at my parents house which is bigger backyard I decided to spend some of my time there have kind of been doing half and a half half of my time there with her and then half the time here I know I shouldn't be moving like that but it's just my sister there and I don't want her to be in this alone and I wanted her to come here and stay here but Isabella moved in so there's not like a guest bedroom anymore she doesn't really want to sit on the couch but I think she's gonna come soon I'll show you guys I'm probably gonna film this vlog over a couple days just to catch all the most exciting stuff we can do also update surprise we got a foster dog so it's happening during this time is a lot of dogs or a lot of dogs over in pounds are you know not having a home they're basically being euthanized because no one can go into work it's like being it's very difficult to take care of them all during this time so we decided to foster a dog as we wanted to do whatever we can and this dog we had sent the application right there and the girl was like hey can you come get him now like we've been holding him since 11:00 a.m. and we can't hold him longer so like she she didn't answer many questions on everything but the fact that they were like please like you have to come get him now oh I don't know what that would have meant for the dog if I didn't take him in but he's the sweetest let me bring him out here so this is cash he's super sweet he's grown he's not a puppy he's potty-trained and amazing and super sweet and a lap dog so I'm happy that we got to give him a better chance at life him and Leo are having a great time playing together but he gets really annoyed he just wants to like be on my lap like this it was just like like during this time of fostering him we're just trying to find him a proper forever home Leo's still a puppy and we just got him so I think it's crazy to try to take on another dog but he's very he's very great and easy to take care of he's super cute super cute so that's what we've been up to it's gonna be craziness when my sister comes here because she has Harley so that every three dogs running around but everyone will have fun so yeah basically we're keeping him until we can find him a proper forever home so I'm gonna update you guys on how things have been going around here I'm gonna do so a good morning I have already ordered breakfast from these cult heroes and now I'm sitting out by the pool lounging with cash right here so I'm gonna get like a little tannin I guess but I have to use so much sunscreen because I'm so pale our pool is green though so that's very upsetting just having a very wholesome Sunday right now ooh babe let's move this mirror so we can get cooler photos look who's here my sister came to quarantine so right now we're making pasta basically the nice guy h.wood group and boo who sent this really cute little date night package whoa pretty good huh yeah lemon I say which is like an amazing awesome yummy restaurant so they set fresh pasta so this is a couple days ago so I would have shown you like how it looked all together but so they sent the fresh pasta they sent this sauce which is like so good ezal and then yeah they gave some awesome car but I don't eat cheese all right basil leaves you think yeah like I don't really want to eat a whole basil leaf no no so this is my ugly bowl I get it well you get the pretty one whatever I'm gonna dress use to no I mean like late Holloway I have you guys stacked up I'm on two loaves of bread ahead whenever I do this Chris seems like this is why your camera always breaks I want like one to like hurry up want a bite with you my hair is so long I look crazy I'm coming in block I'm coming from the whole block you're gonna be just even a bowl of truth no I'm now mixing I needs more on top of England all right ready mmm mine's really good oh my god just like itself really good Anna sauce good morning it's actually like two almost 3 p.m. but my defense I woke up at like 8 9 was up to 10 probably and then I fell back asleep then I woke up this late first of all I'm wearing the set active set but I just did some stretching outside on the yoga mat just a little bit of yoga moves that I know I want to be in the Sun and like break a sweat and get moving stretching and I think that's just really important so I did that this morning but got two new huge additions to my household this is a giant like the biggest mirror I could find literally online from Restoration Hardware and then this console table is from Rick's Restoration Hardware as well we're gonna have to mount this because I want it to just be flat I don't really want it to be leaning and it's that way this can be just closer to the wall but I'm just so so excited these are my first pieces I ever got from Restoration Hardware and I just wanted to get something very grand and big and like even if it was expensive it was worth it because I wouldn't have to like focus on covering this whole wallet since it's so big it like almost does it for me so really excite about that I'm gonna have to order like a nice big bowl for like keys and stuff good morning babe what are you eating okay pokey place is called all about pokey it's the best ever I get tofu online like mangoes avocado fried onion all that good stuff I just did this soft hand it like rinses off in two hours I was just so pale and I just was not feeling this super cute because I haven't had Tannen Wiles used this loving tan one which I stole from Isabella I usually use this saint-tropez wine but she was like this one is way better do you have to try it I have a bunch just like take it and try it out then I've tried it out and it really I mean I'm not done with it yet but putting it on already was so much easier like this ain't repay one comes off in a very like streaky rub which it ends up looking fine once it's like all set and you like rinse it off but it's hard when you're like trying to put it on it's all streaking ugh you keep going over and over and over trying to fix it but this one works so smoothly so I'm excited for I have to take the prize right the best the best angles while vlogging it's a joke I literally suck my house is literally almost done I'm so excited you know there's always gonna be things I'm gonna want to change but for the most part like everything is like almost checked off and outside is something I want to tackle at some point but like right now we'll get to it once we finish this and I honestly feel like I'm gonna leave my bedroom for very laughs I don't know I just well I like to entertain so I rather my backyard and like the living space like be super nice and cute and perfect and I don't really mind that much about my own bedroom because I just like to sleep in there as long as it's comfy so while I'm letting this tan soak in and like really work I'm gonna look online for some extra things since you got that new table I need like Kuehl things to go on it and also what else do I need oh no I'm just gonna do some online shopping but these are my favorite websites to go on if you're interested so West Elm is great cb2 is absolutely my favorite which is like basically the vibe I'm going for for my house look at 30% off outdoor furniture and for something that has more inexpensive options all modern this is a specific site that has a everything on the wayfarer but it's just the modern stuff so this is a nice object to go Joe so what do these transformation that I just went through right now so I love the tan it came out so smooth there's no like growth spurts that happen all the time with other tans other self-tans so I'm happy about that it looks pretty good it's not like super dark I was like I started as I thought it was gonna get but I feel a lot better feel bomb how to snatch my makeup but um as you guys may know I have a new roommate Isabella and we were just hanging out in my room for a
