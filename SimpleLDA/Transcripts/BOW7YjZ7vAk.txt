 the coronavirus what else is there to talk about other than the coronavirus obviously just keep your hands clean and wash your hands remember those wipes you guys just to make fun of me for those disinfectant wipes it's so terrible for your hands perfect time to have those aren't you guys so sick of like constantly washing your hands at this point I'm sick of it not that we should not be not washing their hands well when you're like excessively washing them to the point where they're like ashy coconut I hope whoever gave me this wash their hands probably didn't there's so many stories like on the coronavirus like I'm hearing somebody ate bats and like China I'm hearing it's like a form of population control the conspiracies really are nuts bats population control it's like the t-virus from Resident Evil or the g-virus from Resident Evil except we're not mutating was the T or the G I think that yet the g-virus because in Resident Evil 2 the rats carried the virus and brought it into Raccoon City and that's when the whole viral outbreak started so over here the bats allegedly started the virus how many of you guys have lost your mind yeah just sitting in the house so bored King nothing to do not being able to train then like spar with like my teammates man I want to fight every single person that just walks why really drive by me own fight everybody I was gonna say something but I forgot what it was I hate when that happens oh yeah I'm so mad about UFC 249 I'm so mad and I have to say that the damn fight is more important than safety of like the environment like that's this viral pandemic is like the big issue right now but like khabib can't get out of the country you can't get out of Russia yes you can the dude is like close friends with like Vladimir Putin the president of the country you can call him you let me out of the country I gotta fight Ferguson of course you can get out of the country but that aside I'm so mad that they're trying to find a replacement for Ferguson no we don't want that as fans we do not want a replacement for Ferguson either you get khabib involved you get Ferguson uninvolved this is for like lightweight like to know who's the best fighter in light-weight history I have to put on some event that no one cares about I'm not even gonna get get going on a rant about that because that's just gonna piss me off hardcore fan problems and so crazy right as human beings just when we think we have it easy just one's gonna be have it good you know which we do always have it so so good so damn good this happens our asses are locked up in the house for a couple weeks and we start going mad mad like he imagine if like somehow like the entire world lost electricity not even four weeks lost electricity for like 48 hours how crazy would all of us go no phones nothing oh you go nuts people already going crazy not having sports on TV he's stuck in the house you're seeing home workouts being pushed everywhere all over social media nothing wrong with homework cause people should be doing them anyway especially if you don't want to go to the gym home workouts are great right but man that's it's then this is just so much paranoia I even had paranoia getting these freakin Dunkin Donuts these doughnuts I think I wash their hands I'd be like sneezing sneezing all over the ship   even me I'm like filming this video because I needed to get out of the house I want to hurt someone and now we're hearing that like this is probably going to go on to like may or March April May like yeah we have like another probably six weeks of this I'd like to start filming random videos every day me going crazy is there a hair on - do you guys want random videos and become crazy just wrapped up in a chair  I'll have to start filming random videos every day of me going crazy do you guys want is there a hair on my on this you guys want random videos I mean crazy  just wrapped up in a chair I didn't even know I forgot that like everything is drive-through now I'm gonna try to open the door Dunkin Donuts they're all in there looking at me like but yeah hope you guys have been well stay safe wash your hands those of you that are obviously much younger you're gonna probably likely be in much better shape than obviously those before older underlying health issues I know especially for me I'm extremely nervous for like my mom my mom's over 60 she's got high blood pressure she's got anxiety she's pre-diabetic you know so that stuff has me really really really paranoid it's weird I might have been afraid to potentially catch the virus I'm afraid to potentially catch it and then like pass it to my mom that's what has me really paranoid for in fact a couple weeks ago right before the whole lockdown really started I was I started to have symptoms of like what I was seeing coronavirus and obviously you should go to the doctor for that but like I was just so parent and I thought if I went to the doctor they would like the image they probably will did like lock me up you know and like confinement and I didn't want that so I just waited it out and I feel come like way better it could have just been a regular cold I didn't have like dry cough and fever or anything like that but I did have I had like a really sore throat and I had the one symptom I had and supposedly that you're supposed to have on the virus was like I had like shortness I couldn't take a full breath almost like pneumonia and obviously like this is a respiratory disease so it had me so paranoid but I'm completely better now I'm so happy I feel completely better now but I was very paranoid and I probably should have went to the doctor look at me stubborn stupid don't be like me if you have any of those symptoms or anything like what it's supposed to be go to the doctor immediately yeah stay safe guys I love you guys peace
