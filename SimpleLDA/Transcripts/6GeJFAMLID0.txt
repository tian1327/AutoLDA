 hello guys welcome what is my neighbor just drove past me on a golf cart anyway hi guys welcome back to another vlog this is gonna be the first moving vlog I'm so excited if you saw my previous vlog I told you guys that I looked at an apartment and I was really excited about it so now everything is official a couple days ago I signed the lease a week from tomorrow is when I got the keys and can move in and I'm just so excited to get in there and to see the place completely empty because when I went and toured the apartment the tenant still had her stuff in there she's still in the process of moving out so it's gonna be cool getting to see it like totally empty and mine and I can't wait to show you guys an empty apartment tour that will probably be the next vlog I think this whole one will just be my week of like packing and getting ready for the move I really wanted to like bring you furniture shopping with me and buying like apartment stuff but obviously like we're still in the middle of a pandemic and some places have been opening up and in my particular County everything is pretty much closed the only thing that's open is like Walmart and Target and I went to Target yesterday and it was wiped out so I got a few things but actually this chair back here is one of the things I will I have to take it out and I'll show you but yeah I like barely got anything it was just chaos so everything pretty much that I'm getting I ordered online but obviously you know once everything comes in and I'm unpacking and decorating and putting things away I will show you everything but today I wanted to clean my car because it's a freaking mess and especially because I'm gonna need to like pack this up with stuff when I'm moving obviously I need it to be decluttered cleaned out I have so much crap in my trunk got a garbage bag let's put some music on and get started  here's all the stuff that I got yesterday at Target I just got like some basic essential things you know toilet brush cleaner lint rollers a broom Swiffer cutting board some stuff for the kitchen and this is the chair this is also the welcome mat that I got thought that was cute yeah here's the chair I want to use this as my desk chair it's from the project 62 brand this is the name of it if you guys want to check it out good afternoon it's the next day I forgot my car mount so I'm gonna hold you while I Drive real quick but finished cleaning my car yesterday it feels so good my car has not been this clean and I can't even tell you how long it's kind of embarrassing but it just feels so nice smells really good in here anyway I am currently headed to the salon where I work I have a few things that I just have there that I want to pick up and just have it my apartment and I want to take my blow dryer because the blow dryer that I currently use at my parents house is actually my mom's so I don't have a blow dryer of my own for at home and I figure since we still have no idea when we're going to be able to open I may as well just use the one that I have at the salon and then once we can open up all just by my own to have it home but yeah for now just save myself a little money so weird being in here alright so I'm just gonna grab my blow dryer I have this like multi plug outlet thing and I'm gonna take it back also all right so we're upstairs in the last room so I have this throw blankets from TJ Maxx you know obviously this isn't getting used and it's super soft in a really nice size so I am gonna take that I'm gonna of course wash it when I get home and then I have this acrylic drawer sorry for the siren sound but I have this acrylic drawer and this little acrylic organizer thing and I think I'm gonna take this oh you know what I think I'm gonna take these makeup wipes too just because I don't know like I said what we're gonna be able to open and they might dry out by then so I may as well use them and then I'm gonna take these I have just like a regular plastic drawer thing like this I have a bunch of them at home so I will bring that back to replace this in the meantime I'm just gonna put this stuff in this drawer I am so excited all of my stuff has been arriving we got the TV stand the TV my blender came yesterday I got my dining set are we so excited so it's a couple days later ignore the rest behind me I'm in the process of moving you know I haven't really blogged much of this week because I haven't actually started packing or doing much it's been really hot and sunny the last two days so I've just been trying to enjoy that and be outside majority of what I've been doing this week is just kind of like all online like getting stuff set up and ready like yesterday I called the internet company and scheduled for them to come and set up my internet and I had to order like the modem and router and that kind of boring stuff but yeah at this point pretty much everything is ready to go I have everything ordered all of my stuff should be arriving with the exception of my couch that's gonna come like a week after I move in but everything else should be arriving here before I move and everything started coming in this week today as I showed you a lot of stuff came in and I found out from the landlord that I actually can get the keys a day early so rather than moving in on Monday I can start moving in like Sunday afternoon Sunday evening so that is exciting I got a package in the mail some earrings that I ordered from Etsy so I thought that I would unbox them not sponsored at all I just get questions all the time about my jewelry and specifically where I get my like little dainty gold earrings and stuff and I had ordered some new ones and I figured I would share you're interested so I don't order from like any one particular shop what I do is I will go on there and if there's something in particular that I'm looking for I will just search for that and I just scroll through until I see something that I like usually what I will just search is like dainty gold jewelry these earrings that I got from a shop that I've never ordered from before but it came very quickly look how cute the packaging is this shop is called gold spoon jewelry so here's what these little earrings look like this one has a little spike on it and then the other one has just a little like cubic zirconium fake diamond looking thing good morning guys it is of the next day I've just been sitting in bed drinking my cup of coffee and I was watching some videos because one thing that I really want to do when I move into my new place is get some house plants but I don't know anything about them like I have no idea what kind of plant is the best to get you know what kind need direct light versus indirect light how often should you water them how do you repot them went like so I have been doing a little bit of research trying to find like what are the easiest plans to take care of like the best ones for beginners so I was looking on Skillshare and I actually watched two classes on there and shout out to them for sponsoring this portion of today's video thank you so much Skillshare you guys are unfamiliar with Skillshare they are an online learning community with thousands of classes for creative and curious people to explore new skills deep in existing passions and get lost in creativity they offer creative classes designed for real life and all the circumstances that come with it these lessons can help you stay inspired express yourself and introduce you to a community of millions they have classes from marketing crafts productivity videography animation like so many things so I went on there and I just searched for houseplants to see like what classes they had for that and they have quite a few that just teach you about like the basics houseplants for beginners like how to pick the right plant so I watched to like I said the first one that I watched is from the sill called happy houseplants pick a perfect plan that one was super helpful and understanding like depending on your space and how much sunlight you get how the humidity is etc like what kind of plants are best for different environments and then the second one that I watched is five house plants for beginners how to take care of them by mark shorter and I'm not gonna lie his voice is like a little monotone and it was a little dull but the information was really really helpful and he just goes through the five like easiest to take care of plants and goes into a little more detail and like specifically how to take care of each one so I think that I definitely I'm gonna get a snake plants because it seems like that is the easiest and most low-maintenance one to take care of and then once I get a little bit more familiar and more comfortable taking care of them then I would love to get more and just like completely fill my apartment with them but you know I got a start in baby steps but anyway if you guys are interested in

now that I've watched that and had my first cup of coffee I am ready to start packing so I need to obviously pack up my whole bedroom that I also have some things in the bathroom then I need to pack up and then I need to go around and get some kitchen stuff I did order like plates and silverware and cooking utensils and that kind of stuff but we have so much extra stuff in the kitchen so my mom was like just go through I have like triple of so many things so just take whatever you need so as far as like pots and pans and baking dishes and stuff like that I am just gonna take from here oh and then I have my whole filming set up down in the basement but I think I'm gonna leave that for last I'm gonna start in here and I'm gonna start with the closet and then I'll work my way to my makeup and that kind of stuff it's so weird because when I was in college I had moved every single year for like five years in a row and I literally became a packing and moving ex but now it's been so long since I've done it I've been back at my parents house now for three and a half years oh my god Wow what I'm gonna do for my clothes I just got some garbage bags and I'm just gonna throw everything in garbage bags that I found is the easiest way to do it because you can fit a lot of clothes in a garbage bag and then it takes up less space than a box and then it's kind of nice too because then I'll have these big stuffed soft bags of clothes that I can use as like padding in the car when I'm moving like furniture and fragile things you know so that's what I'm gonna do and I don't even really care about necessarily keeping my clothes organized I'm just gonna fit as much as I can in each garbage bag because once I get to the new apartment I have a much bigger closet there so I'm gonna completely like reorganize everything there anyway so all right put you over here  so while I was going through my closet I found this and I remembered that I had this but it was kind of like buried so I hadn't seen it in a long time it says I need you which is so cute so little dish towel and I had bought this like two years ago I want to say at Target I doubt that it's available anymore cuz like I said I got it years ago but I saw it in the store and I thought it was so cute and I bought it and I was like you know what I'm gonna keep this and when I finally move out by myself I'm gonna use it so it still has the tags on it and everything has never been used and I'm so excited to put this in my kitchen anyway um the closet is pretty empty it's coming along I did keep some stuff out so that you know I need clothes to wear over the next couple of days this stuff I don't know if I want anymore so I think I'm just gonna like keep it here and then once everything opens back up I will donate it I still have to pack up my jeans that's all my winter clothes so that I will just leave it how it is and just bring that but drawers are all empty now and then I haven't decided what I'm gonna do about my shoes this is the part that I hate the most like I'm looking forward to getting there and then unpacking everything because it's gonna be fun like organized I just I don't know I love that kind of stuff but packing everything and then having to move it all I hate I hate it so much luckily my apartment is only like less than 15 minutes away from my parents house so it's not like that big of a deal I can just keep going back and forth and make more both trips so at least I'm not going far and I don't have to worry about like making everything fit in one trip and I don't like have to pack everything all at once like I can always just come back and forth so it's a couple hours later I had went out to the grocery store for a bit just took a little bit of a break but now I'm gonna go through everything that I have here at my desk and I know it's so messy just please excuse that so one side of my desk is just all of like you know office type stuff and then the other side I have all of my makeup and then these bins here I just have extra products extra skin care hair products etc I have this big giant bin that is just filled with extra products PR stuff that I literally had since my last apartment so yeah it's been three and a half years since I've gone through this I'm sure that majority of this stuff is probably expired by now so I need to just go through it and throw out anything that isn't good anymore anything that I don't want to keep oh my god I had an extra tanning mitt are you kidding me  here's the other half - that little acrylic drawer that you guys saw me pick up from the salon I've just been keeping makeup in it but I was thinking that I would stack the two on top of each other and store my sunglasses in it I just think that that would be a cool way to store them in a place where they won't accumulate dust but also be able to see them because the way that I've been storing them now they were just like all stacked on top of each other and a big lump so anyway I went through this entire bin I had a huge garbage bag just filled with products a lot of stuff was expired I was like opening things smelling it a lot just wasn't good so there was some stuff though that I ended up keeping and then I just filled up all of these drawers that had all of my makeup in them put all that stuff in there cleared out all the stuff that was in this that had like skin care and hair products and stuff this I think I'm gonna use in the kitchen as just some extra like pantry storage I still just have to go through that thing that I haven't gone through in a while so there's probably some expired stuff that can get thrown out as well in here I honestly hate having to throw products out it feels extremely wasteful I just used to get so much stuff as PR and it was like overwhelming and it was just too much for me to go through and I would have some things that I did want to keep because I was interested in using it but then I would just forget about it it would get like lost in a bin somewhere but now then I'm not really doing like makeup in beauty videos as much I haven't been getting as much makeup and the products that I have been getting I've been able to like keep control of a little bit better so hopefully this will no longer be an issue once I get rid of this stuff I mean I know this bin is huge and it's a lot of stuff so yeah anyway I'm gonna go through those now and then all I have to do is pack up the office stuff I'm gonna wait and get all like the kitchen and bathroom stuff probably tomorrow good morning it is the next day it's actually probably afternoon by now a bunch more packages arrive today at this point I only have a couple more that are still supposed to be arriving either tomorrow or Monday but one of the things that came is my kitchen garbage it's super cheap not the best quality I got it online from Target but it came in this huge obnoxious box and I felt like it was just kind of wasting space so I am gonna fill this up with my hangers just trying to pack as efficiently as possible there we go overflowing but they're in there nice and secure and then I can just carry it all up like this so yeah everything is coming along I went through these bins last night and I had a lot of stuff in here that was expired as well this was completely jam-packed with stuff and I was able to condense it all into one of the drawers and then I went through the bathroom and collected all of my stuff out of there so now in here I have all of like my waxing stuff color supplies extra hair products extra skin care etc Oh hair tools and brushes and stuff down here and I even have a little bit of extra room in this bottom drawer to put more stuff if I need to which actually just put these in there there we go these are some extra blankets and sheets that I need to bring with me I'll probably just throw those in a garbage bag as well I went through all of my makeup drawers to know this is completely empty now I just need to go through this drawer because this has like office supply stuff and kind of random stuff coloring books oh and like cables and wires and stuff and then I still need to pack my shoes and then I still just have to pack up some kitchen stuff and my filming equipment downstairs and then after that'll be pretty much done and I still obviously have all today all tomorrow and then like half of Sunday so I still have plenty of time no rush all my stuff packed up and I even have more stuff in the car too so this isn't even really all of it but crazy oh and more stuff over there how do you feel it's my last full day are you sad are you gonna cry no I could always come in harass you I'll stand on the street corner and be that tonight is gonna be my last night sleeping here which is so crazy for those of you who maybe are newer to my channel and don't really know the story I moved out of my parents house when I went to college when I was 18 and then after I graduated I moved back home for like a year or so and then I had moved out with my boyfriend at the time that my ex-boyfriend and then like two years after that I decided to move back home change careers that's when I went to cosmetology school ended that relationship and I've just been here ever since three and a half years now it's crazy I moved back here Christmas of 2016 I just started from the bottom again and was just busting my ass trying to make money and save up and get my student loans paid off and I just can't believe that like I'm finally moving out on my own and it's my first time living completely by myself even when I've moved out in the past I always had roommates or lived with the boyfriends so this is my first time being a hundred percent financially independent and it's so exciting and feel so good and hopefully fingers crossed I will continue to do well for myself and be okay and not need to come back and of course I'm so grateful and appreciative to my parents before letting me be here and for being supportive of me and you know I know that I can always come back home if I need to and I know that not everyone can say that so I'm very grateful and I don't want anyone to think for a second that I take that for granted but I'm turning 28 next week so I'm just I'm ready and I'm a person who I'm very independent I like my own space I like my privacy so yeah I think I'm going to wrap up this vlog here I will pick back up tomorrow on move-in day and I will share with you guys an empty apartment tour and you know the whole moving-in unpacking the process and yeah I'm I'm so excited I'm excited to share it all with you so thank you for watching if you're not subscribed already make sure you subscribe so you don't miss the rest of the moving
