  finished our signs looked a little bit ratchet not gonna lie but you know it works my girl brought out her dog justice hey guys welcome back to my channel another day another vlog so um before you guys keep on watching this vlog i just want to give a quick disclaimer i just want you guys to know that this vlog is not going to be like my usual vlogs you guys know i try to keep my vlogs very light-hearted always good time good vibes so i just want to give you guys a quick warning that this video is probably not going to be like those other vlogs that i usually do this vlog is going to be a bit more serious so you know if that's what you were looking for unfortunately this is not going to be that type of video so just come back next week a very light-hearted fun vlog should be up i actually wasn't even going to post a video this week because it just didn't sit right with my heart with everything that's going on right now to just post a lighthearted vlog but i thought to myself that i really should be using my following and influence for good my heart feels so heavy an african-american man by the name of george floyd was murdered by a police officer george floyd is one of the many african-americans murdered at the hands of police we've had enough and there needs to be change if you guys follow me on instagram you guys know i've been pretty vocal about advocating for the black lives matter movement but if you're not aware or educated about it i'll be leaving links down below so that you can educate yourself and that we can spread more awareness for it to my black brothers and sisters out there i am in full support and i hear you and i might not understand your pain but i will listen and i will support you and i will continue to add to your voice that's how we're starting off the vlog i guess so today i'm actually going to new york and i'll be taking you guys with me i'm going to be going to a peaceful protest for the black lives matter movement also i am going to be monetizing this video i wasn't at first but if i monetize it i will be donating the money to the black lives matter movement um i know that there are a few fundraisers going on right now i'm not really sure which one i'm going to pick yet but watch through the ads y'all you guys already know what to do let's support this movement together let's add to the voice okay it doesn't matter what color you are you should be supporting this movement too that's pretty much it um i'm sweating as always okay we're gonna get ready to go to this protest i'm excited let's go okay guys so i'm about to get out of my house we're gonna go to the protest i'm wearing all black of course in support of the black lives matter movement i'm also wearing a hat because my friend amanda she said that just in case you know if the peaceful protest goes bad um to kind of like protect my face and stuff so i'm gonna be wearing a mask i'm gonna be wearing my hat hopefully it doesn't get to that point  gotta take off the hoops it's probably not safe in a protest  oh  all right y'all we're back in the whip we're about to go to dollar tree so that i could grab some supplies and we can make some signs for the protest um and then we're gonna go straight to new york city i'm gonna be meeting my friend amanda we're gonna be going to the protest together i'm really excited i'm also a little bit

make these signs for the protest we're going to be waving the ships in the air yes  finished our sign looks a little bit ratchet not going to lie but you know it works it works she spelled hers wrong and she tried to fix it no no that's okay she spelled compliance with an e no but also i put black lives matters and if you could see i changed the end to the freaking exclamation point nyu education out here we're ready this is my child we're ready to go asians for black lives let's go let's go  lina we're walking to the protest right now right now we're protesting alone it's just us too but it's cool guys so they boarded up the cvs because of the riots they've been boarding up a lot of the banks and some of the restaurants see you can see over there and over there they're boarding everything up so that when people are looting their stores and stuff don't get ruined i think this was part of the protest yesterday because it did get violent yesterday oh my gosh coffee break gotta get this energy for this protest  y'all i think we found it  don't shoot don't shoot   i just want to know what this guy is doing in the middle of the fountain  so this is just the memorial that we made with flowers to honor the lives of the three unarmed black individuals killed almond aubrey brianna taylor and george floyd as you guys can tell this protest is peaceful as hell and it was so beautiful to see so many different people from different backgrounds come together in support of the black lives matter  movement so we continued our protest walking towards union square as you can see it's still super peaceful um there were so many people coming together and helping one another there were people handing out supplies waters to the protesters there are people standing outside their apartment standing outside their windows just showing their support banging their pots and pans and this is something that actually made my day this old couple came out just to show their support and you know encourage the protesters and it was just such a beautiful thing to see in new york city and my heart just felt so full this day hello justice my girl brought out her dog oh my gosh that dog is so cute guys look how many people there are i look he lost my voice from screaming so much but we out here we're still wrapping our signs it was so nice to see people that are supporting the same movement it just really warmed my heart especially to see such diverse groups of people coming together good energy good vibes it was such a peaceful protest what you see in the media of like these violent protests yes they exist but there are also a lot of very peaceful protests out here so and it was definitely an experience now we're hungry so we're about to get some food i don't know what we're getting but we're about to eat swell  hello i'm waiting for you to put your face in thank you sorry before we continue the video can we just talk about what the hell that black thing is on my face because it's literally bothering me while i'm editing so i'm sure it bothers you too so i'm sorry i don't know what that is but okay resume to the video we're here we're eating now after the protest got some chicken got the sous ready to eat chicken baby you don't feel my pain please hell yeah chicken  amanda's still eating i finished everything i literally inhaled my food all right time to try these these are healthy because it has calcium in it you see yo this is such a rip-off look at this look at this box and then look at this tiny ass bag bruh are you kidding i could eat all this in one bite this is me this is amanda this is us at our protest today hey guys so i'm back home obviously i just wanted to quickly turn on the camera and say thank you if you made it to the end of this video i know that this vlog wasn't like my other very light-hearted vlogs so if you made it to the end of this video um it really means a lot to me and that also shows me that you actually really care about this entire movement i usually don't talk this much in front of the camera so let me get prepared first i am monetizing this video only because i do want to donate whatever i make from this video to the black lives matter movement if you all keep on watching through the ads on this video i greatly appreciate it these recent events the killings of george floyd briana taylor almond aubry they are just a few of the many many black americans innocent black americans who were killed by police as people as decent human beings we need to support them and we need to add to their voice it doesn't matter what color you are you should be in support of black lives matter because black lives do matter and they are not being treated as such i know that everyone can't protest especially you know with this whole pandemic going on right now my parents were very iffy about letting me go um which i completely understand so if you can't protest use your voice that way use your voice in other ways first you can educate yourself and others on this issue you can donate you can also check in on your close ones who are part of the black community you can use your voice in different ways i just want to say to my black brothers and sisters i love you guys i hear you and i feel your pain not to the extent um but i can i can listen and i can do whatever i can using my voice so we hear you and we love you and we're supporting you all the way i'm losing my voice from the protest and i'm talking hella right now if you want to follow me on instagram go ahead and do that if you're a real one and
