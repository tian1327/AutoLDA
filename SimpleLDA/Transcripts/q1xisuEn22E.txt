    hi everyone so I moved to New York in like six days obviously I'm keeping an eye on all of the travel situations recommendations that being said all of my appointments to start my credentialing process I guess at work are still on for next week so at this time I'm still planning to go out there on Monday and proceed with those until then I have a lot of work to do here if you can't tell by me my room is quite messy this is the current state of my room so obviously I still have a lot of work to do I have to kind of sort through everything decide what I'm putting into storage here at my parents what I'm going to take with me in my three suitcases and what I'm just going to donate get rid of so that's the goal for today is just to kind of sort through everything a migrant picked up so that's what I'm gonna do   good morning guys so I am still scheduled to leave for New York in four days the last couple days I have been cleaning and decluttering finally got everything sorted out so I have all this stuff that is going to be donated I have all of this stuff that I sold on Poshmark then I have all this stuff that is trash latest update on the situation still getting more and more cases and I think that is mostly because they have more accessibility to tests so it's hard to know if we really kind of are on trend with all the other countries or if we are just having a better representation of what is actually going on plan for today is to run all those errands kind of sort everything out and start packing so I will see you guys in a bit  okay okay so a lot of change in the past 72 hours everyone that I know has left New York City I've seen YouTube videos of grocery stores completely empty so I'm a little bit nervous mostly just about being able to get the supplies that I need it's such a densely populated area and it seems to be spreading very very quickly there so I guess we're just gonna take it one day at a time so I'm going to try to pack as much food and supplies as possible I kind of have everything laid out so the next challenge is going to be I think it all in I wish me luck I don't know it is midnight I am very tired I leave in 13 hours I'm nervous I'm excited a lot of stuff going on definitely not what I thought I was going to be walking into definitely not the blog I thought I was going to be making the night before I left for my new life but it is what it is and we're just gonna make the best of it so I need to get all this into here I already have the air mattress and yoga mat so now we just have all that stuff   Oh     every tripod so this last few but I made it to New York the whole travel experience was super weird there was known at the airport there was seven people on my flight there was like two people in the line four overs and usually outlook are dia it's like a million people I mean it here safely so very thankful for that everything is just like super desolate right now a lot of people out walking but there's not very many cars on the street it's like really quiet I'm happy because that means that everyone is like doing what they're supposed to and staying home like yeah I'm excited to be here other than the fact that everything is closed playing at this point is just kind of like self quarantine here until we get the all clear it's safe to like go back to our daily activities like I said I just taking it one day at a time and hoping to stay healthy and stay safe so that's kind of a life update for you guys I'm here in New York City I'll be starting my job in the next couple of weeks I'm really excited to start this new journey thanks to everyone that supported me along the way stay safe stay healthy and stay at home bye guys  you
