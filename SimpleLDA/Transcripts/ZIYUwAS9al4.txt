 good morning it is friday march 3rd and i was successful in picking up a dog walk i'm very cautious about which ones i pick up or which ones i've tried to pick up this one is only like three-fourths of a mile from where i live so no buses are involved i'm just it's like a 15-minute walk there um i'll walk the dog for half an hour i'm a little skeptical i don't know which is better because it says someone will be home so that means they're going to hand the dog off to me i don't know if that's better or worse than me having to go inside their their home and getting the dog i'm not really sure but i know it's a risk but i tried to file for unemployment and i didn't get it in the state of washington so i don't know what i'm gonna do you know i'm just i'm just doing making decisions to the best of my ability every day make a little twelve dollars and go straight back home and hopefully everything is okay i brought gloves with me i'll wash my hands as soon as i get back yeah i'll take take out precautions that i can even if i can just make a little like 50 because really food is the only thing i'm worried about like all my bills they can kick  rocks i need food at some point so even if i can just make a little bit here and there that's that's what i need to do    this is green lake park and this place is usually packed always no matter what time of the day and there's barely there's a few runners and walkers out but it's pretty deserted  so today was a rough day today was the first day that i i kind of lost it not so much being in quarantine or whatever just realizing that like i am so far away from friends and family right now and that if anything were to happen to me like or to them you know i i can't get there they can't get here um it's just really scary i have been reliant on a certain friend of mine to like we talk all day every day for the last week or so and it's really like kept my spirits up and kept me you know functioning and um yeah they were they were busy they had a bunch of people over they live in another country that's not as affected as we are yeah so the communication was not as frequent and i was i spent more time in my thoughts more time by myself today and it really just got to me and you know that's not fair to them that i'm so dependent on their presence to keep me sane i wanted to take a nap but i kind of just like was rested i just like like buried myself under my blankets cried for a little while and it's okay to cry you know it's okay to be emotional during all of this it's a scary scary time but we don't know like everything is so up in the air i hope you're finding ways to cope and to deal with all of this as well the cdc is now recommending that everyone who leaves the house go out with some type of protective mask over their mouth and nose if you don't have the proper n95 masks which hopefully most civilians don't because they're in such a shortage for nurses and doctors and people on the front lines that they're the ones who need them the most people when this first thing when this thing first started uh started hoarding all of these masks and uh protective equipment and stuff like that and now like they're scrambling and uh trump is even um there's there's this law and effect that if there's a like a state of emergency that he can require that certain factories and stuff like that cease producing whatever it is that they normally produce and produce you know whatever is needed at the time so there's a lot of i think like ge factories and um several other factories some of some workers have even demanded that they stop producing whatever it is that they're producing normally and um help produce but yeah we can you know wear just like regular like regular masks or i know a lot of people are sewing their own masks or creating their own masks the statistics right now are that the number of people testing positive here in seattle is has gone down this week but i don't want to you know rejoice yet or anything like that because it's still rising in other places like new york city and los angeles this is the first day that i just i really wasn't productive i didn't i made breakfast and i made lunch and i did that one dog walk and that was that was it that was it um i didn't write morning pages i didn't do any editing i didn't transfer any of my photos nothing i just kind of i just had an off day which is completely okay because that's what we should be doing you know we should shouldn't be go still like going going going going all the time like this is a time that i really feel like it's necessary that we um step back from you know this capitalistic mentality of always having to produce something and really just i hate to say enjoy the time take this time out to do things differently and like get in touch with our bodies and yeah and i'm i think i've been doing a good job of that i've been doing a good job of listening to my body i've been doing a good job of going further like deeper into my myself my emotions my character the roots of who i am why i am but yeah today today was nice to just do nothing and that's exactly what i needed and hopefully tomorrow i can wake up and be in better spirits our stay stay at home shelter in place rule law order whatever has been extended now um it was through sometime in mid april now it's all the way through the end of april or maybe into the first part of may we'll be here inside now for at least another month i'm i'm crossing things off the list slowly but surely i'm working on it it's it's coming coming along pretty well it's slow but it's progress anyways that's the update for right now and i will see you all in the morning good morning everyone it is what day is it sunday i almost said march today is sunday april 5th day 25 of quarantine for me no you're not going crazy you're not confused there was zero vlog yesterday i filmed nothing i just was not feeling it at all here i am still touching my face but yesterday it was just i did nothing like i literally i made breakfast and i made dinner and i just laid around and i dealt with some personal issues as well talked to some friends shout out to shangri i talked to him for like an hour starting today i think that i'm going to start um checking the statistics in the morning and reporting on them because i think it's important for posterity i'm also writing them in my morning pages so right now as of this morning worldwide there have been 1 million 237 420 confirmed cases of the two hundred coronavirus fifty two thousand nine hundred and forty four of those have recovered and sixty seven thousand two hundred and sixty people have died in the united states three hundred twenty one thousand and twenty cases have been confirmed sixteen thousand five hundred and sixteen have recovered uh nine thousand one hundred and nine have died i'm actually keeping track of four different states because i've lived in four different places um i currently live in washington state i've also lived in new york city i've lived in los angeles and uh i'm from and my family lives in florida currently so new york has actually been hit the hardest of everyone in the country um so here in seattle we actually had the first confirmed case of the coronavirus um but since then new york has just skyrocketed the new york state has seen 113 704 confirmed cases and 3565 people have died next up is california with 12 838 people confirmed and only 285 people have died florida 11 536 have confirmed and 195 people have died and then washington state uh 7591 confirmed and 310 people have died so this is i'm just getting these statistics by going to google and typing in coven 19 statistics and all of the information will pop up right away yeah so uh i have eaten breakfast this morning i didn't film any of it because i don't know i'm getting tired of filming the the food i just got done writing my morning pages and i'm in the mood to do some video editing so that's what i'm going to do i'm about to set up my laptop and try to knock out as many things as possible good morning everyone it is i don't know nothing makes sense anymore no it is monday tuesday holy crap what day is it hold on it is tuesday april 7th 2020 i've spent the morning watching uh photography class online there's a bunch of them on creativelive.com that are free and some of them are just uh free for the moment uh just streaming live for like a day or two i've been doing a lot uh personally um working on the artist's way book some more have a scam likely call coming in i typically eat breakfast between like around 8 o'clock in the morning but since i eat so much yesterday and i had this class this morning i didn't really have time to make anything and i wasn't hungry so yeah but now it is 10 55 in the morning and i'm gonna go ahead down my roommate was nice enough to give me a thing of tofu i didn't even ask for it she just asked if i wanted it i was like yes please please please the stores don't have it so i'm gonna go make some tofu scramble and some grand biscuits which are my absolute favorite they didn't have the honey butter unfortunately because of the shortage of everything but i did get the original so all as well yeah we will continue on with our day oh um in more um somber news uh yesterday the united states reached over 10 000 deaths due to the coronavirus i know it seems like every day is the same day because i just i live in this gray hoodie it's so comfortable and it keeps me warm and it's like i don't know i just like the material all right let's go  so normally i use uh like extra firm tofu but seeing as the stores are well at least the store that i go to is completely out right now my roommate was kind enough to give me one of hers that she got from the food bank and it's a silken tofu so it's not extra firm it's like a lot more squishy and but i'm not sure how this scramble is gonna turn out with that but we're gonna find out and i don't care because it's free so that's all that matters so we'll see what happens    wow  so i have decided to pick up a walk is about two miles from here and it's for a dog that i've walked several times before i haven't been outside and honestly i'm like not really not really missing it i'm just thinking that it's best that i go ahead and take a little walk and there's a grocery store that's right next to where the dog lives so as soon as um i'm done with the walk i'm gonna go to the store and pick up a few items that i am that i need that i've run out of or i'm close to running out of yeah so it should take me like an hour to walk there maybe a little less probably like 40 minutes but i'm allowing a little bit more time in case i want to stop and photograph anything i'm taking i'm have on pants two socks uh shoes um i have this and i'm going to put this on and then also my other jacket as well i've taken off my ring i'm not going to wear any earrings because there's just more things for this virus to cling to so i have another pair of pants that are like this but a different design that i'm going to use because i don't have a mask so i'm going to use that as a makeshift mask i'm hoping that it'll it'll work out and i can get it to look decent and i don't look like totally insane going outside i i don't really know how to feel about it i think subconsciously i've been a little anxious because i picked up the walk you know yesterday the day before i think it was the day before so i've known about it for a little while and last night i just like i didn't sleep so well i had some like kind of stress and induced dreams but um physically and mentally i don't feel like i'm stressed but maybe maybe in in some ways subconsciously i am because of everything that's going on so yeah i have gloves that i'll wear when i get there and this will be like the last time i touch my face um yeah i'm just gonna be to use the same precautions as as i did before come home take these clothes straight off do laundry um yeah just the best that we can do all right i am all suited up and ready to go all right so so far so good i'm having a little bit of fogging with my glasses but it goes away within a couple of seconds so it's not too bad and i don't know if you can see it doing it right now but yeah there's no one out here i haven't seen one person oh there goes two people right right down there but yeah normally there's still people out like walking around and exercising and stuff like that but i see no one right now also i didn't check the weather and it's a lot hotter than i remember it's a lot hotter than just seven days ago so i have two layers on right now and i'm already sweating so i guarantee that i think this uh this jacket is gonna come off in just a bit  you
