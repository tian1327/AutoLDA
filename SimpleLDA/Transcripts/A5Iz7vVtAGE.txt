all linked below in the description oh it's Saturday I've been working from home all week I'd only work Monday through Wednesday actually it's not all week but you know it's been a pretty tough week just want to be like open and real with you guys I had a death in the family a very very close family friend who I actually called my aunt she wasn't actually my aunt she's my mom's best friend so on top of the corona virus and now it's been a very tough weird strange week and it's kind of tough and a death happens during this whole epidemic because there's like caps and stuff on funerals and weeks and it's just absolutely crazy it's a madness I can't believe this is all happening but yeah I'm just praying and hoping that we all get through this and better times are gonna come soon I know they well like I really have faith and hope and optimism that this will be over by summer we can only hope anyways on a lighter note like I said it's Saturday I I'm just gonna take you through a little quarantine day in my life I know it's not technically quarantine I keep getting like the ends on Instagram like you're not quarantine your social distancing yes I know but like everyone's calling it quarantine and like I haven't been really leaving my house I also I'm gonna call it quarantine disclaimer I'm sorry but yeah so I just woke up I took my little vitamins and supplements I take in the morning and I just made some tea so I'm just gonna chill out watch the news and drove my tea and then I'm gonna probably do an at-home workout I've been wanting to try Melissa health everyone's been recommending her to me I'm saying that's trier so that's what I'm gonna do and I guess we'll see what the day takes me if so I'm just gonna do a quick little at-home workout with Melissa would health this is my first workout from her I know she has some free ones on her IG TV and so before I do her free trial I'm just gonna try all her free ones first and then I will look more into our program I'm just going to do a 15-minute core sculpting class on her Instagram  not workout was actually so good I did the 15-minute 30-minute a blonde and then I did a lower body one of hers and they were so good sited like 30 minutes total and I might go for a walk later so that will be my exercise for today I'm out of breath I need a smoothie right now though like stat and I wanted to be super refreshing so I'm thinking like pineapple lemon ginger water cucumber oh no I just wanted to be like really refreshing and cold right now and not like not like a creamy smoothie I'm not like a icy juicy smoothie so I'm gonna make right now I'll show you when I decide what I want to put in it I did some frozen banana probably a good quarter of it probably like a cup of pineapple frozen in a whole Clementine I did a little bit of ginger root and then added water normally I would want coconut water but that ain't an option right now so just regular water is what I decided on  movies obviously don't fill me because they are just watery and stuff they just add nutrients to me and refresh me so I need to eat something I haven't had pancakes in so freakin long because I've never been able to find a mix dot was gluten free and dairy free and vegan this finally found this one Maple Grove farms and when I cooked some pancakes up because I've been craving these for weeks hi guys I just got changed I mean shower later because I'm going to meet Joey right now and go on like a little nature walk thing by his house so we're gonna go walk and then just like get out of the house and try to be normal a little bit I guess I don't know um yeah so I'll see you later   we decided to venture out and go to the pressed drive-thru and get an acai bowl and this drive-through line is crazy its way up there like beyond that woman where the window is and I guess this is what happens when we're quarantine in people classic these are always the best to say u-bolts and prep you get an extra spoon yeah that's okay well sheriff spoon because at this point if you get thrown out I get Corona my Roma I just got home I've been at Joey's house most of the day went on a walk we went to pressed cafe anybody acai bowl from the drive-through so it's not that we can't go in but I just got home I got some packages I want to show you real quick so I ordered this on Nordstrom's I bought this at a store in Portsmouth New Hampshire in black and another vlog I posted this week or last week and I loved it so much in North Stearns had it for $15 it was originally 20 I got it for 15 with free shipping and where's having unbelievable sales right now and it's like a cherry red color it almost looks pink looks a little more red in person but I love it it's just the same top I showed you with like the little dainty straps and then extra small small this is the name of it if you want to know and then I go up some stuff from peak tees actually this is from nutri celebrity they just sent me this woman's probiotic I have to like post for them but I got a bunch of T things so they're stick is tea crystals instead of like letting it seep you just mix it and blend it in hot or cold water so this is gonna be great so I can make iced tea I never am able to make my own iced tea at home and they sent me their matcha they're mint green resister jasmine green and oh this is mint green so I don't know what that is I just might be regular mint this is hibiscus what's for gut health is I've got health ginger digestion and then this one is the passion fruit green oh these are so nice oh so nice of them I'm gonna actually make one of these right now I don't know which one I should do I think I'll do the berry passion fruit green I just used the very high that's just want to make my own berry tea and it actually came out really good I mean there's a couple things still at the bottom but I think that's just like the parts of the berry in it and I also just made some cookies they're gluten free and dairy free they're not vegan because I did put eggs in them and I don't know how they're kind of come out so far they aren't really melting or doing anything and I'm very skeptical because the batter didn't taste too great and I always screw up cooking I can never do anything right so I guess we'll see how they come out here they are they taste pretty good actually they just look weird in there very crumbly but yeah I'm my closest or spuma Instagram I'm not sure I'm gonna make a quick little dinner I'm gonna do a brown rice pasta penne and I love love love brown rice pasta it's gluten free I just it's just it's so good in my stomach rather than regular pasta this is the T Fiat I've run and I'm not I'm gonna I haven't tried this brand yet so I'm gonna make that then I'm gonna saut√© up some olive oil garlic and lemon juice and add in some Trader Joe's and a mommy's these are unshelled and then I know they're called edamame but I mean my mom called an edamame right whatever and then a little bit of chopped tomato into it and then I'll just add it all together okay this is the final product to came out so good I'm so excited to eat this oh my god we just made the mixture in the garlic and the olive oil with some lemon and then I poured it over some brown rice pasta I'm gonna add some nutritional yeast and red pepper flakes to it and just listed so
