 i feel like a big part of quarantine and lockdown is all the food that i've been eating good morning everybody welcome to another vlog we are currently i want to say approaching day 40 of lockdown here in seattle i have been here at our house our new home uh self quarantining since march 13. it is now april 20 something and um if you saw my last one of my last vlogs about my routine during lockdown you know that we've been doing a lot of eating and that's what today's vlog is going to be about i've been seeing some vlogs on youtube of people showing what they eat in a day and i thought that since today is kind of a special day and i'll kind of mention a little bit about why in a second i wanted to document and share with you guys what i eat during my average day during quarantine especially since there's something special going on later tonight but if you're new to my channel my name is jerome hi i'm typically a travel vlogger but i'm here at home locked down in the seattle area as i'm sure a lot of you guys are as well they say in washington state they're going to be easing um the lockdown restrictions on may 4 but i think a few days ago they have already said that it's not going to be a flip of a switch that it's not going to be a flip of a switch where all the restrictions are going to be it's going to be a gradual transition which i think is the right approach so that we could test and learn our way into getting back to some sort of normalcy but i mentioned later today i'm excited to share with you guys if you saw a lot of my vlogs every year during my birthday i go to one of seattle's best i want to say seattle's best restaurant called canalis they are a fine dining restaurant in seattle they've been around since the 1950s and they are a prominent well-known staple here in seattle you pretty much go there whenever there's like a good occasion as a lot of you guys know a lot of industries are suffering during this time because of the pause in our economy and restaurant industries are no exception a lot of restaurants are trying to figure out creative ways to be able to make money and gain that capital during a time when in restaurant dining is non-existent and candles actually is doing a meal delivery service where they provide a different menu every day and you pretty much buy online and they kind of range between different prices last week i saw a crab boil earlier this week was like a rabbit ragu or something but today me and my brother and jessica are going to be getting a meal from canales it comes with a mane a side a salad a dessert and we got a bottle of wine we're excited to show you guys what that entails candles is super known for the ambiance of it being super classy super elegant and we're gonna see how how this experience will go because i don't live in the seattle city limit area they don't deliver all the way to where i live so i'm actually going to be venturing out later today to pick up the meal between five and six pm which is fine um they're doing a curbside pickup which is awesome and i'm just gonna show you guys my experience it is the morning time i have a meeting in a few minutes but let's go grab some breakfast upstairs so here we are in the kitchen let me show you guys what i do if you saw last vlog we pretty much start our day off with coffee with the carrot machine my best friend elsie the other day actually dropped off cookies that she got an order from from this place called um low rider baking company they also have been doing uh cookie deliveries which you know back to the whole seeing how companies and restaurants and places adapt to this new normal and i've been having cookies every day for the past like three days for breakfast so we're gonna have a coffee and a cookie for breakfast i think today i'm going to grab this one and maybe grabbing an orange this is like a cutie this is pretty much our breakfast to start off our morning okay so it's lunch time and jessica's making filipino salmon basically like i feel like all filipinos make salmon the same way and like the biggest uh similarity is that there is always like a nice little layer of mayonnaise in which you broil on top of the salmon but um so good last time but here's what you do coating the top of the salmon with some lemon juice sprinkling the top with some salt cracking some pepper chop some onions adding in some mayo mixing both together slicing the lemon having the layer of mayo and then placing the lemon on top of the salmon we'll take it to the oven to cook and we'll show you guys the after  and to top it off we got some steamed rice okay so i am done with work it is 4 30 with the coronavirus still going on the pandemic going on i've been staying home a lot of the times and whenever i do go out i make sure to protect myself and i do have a homemade cloth mask that my mom made me there's a little pocket in here where i put an additional filter so i have a coffee filter on here to add that extra level of protection i have about like three other masks but this one is a zebra print and um my mom also put like you know those kindergarten arts and crafts box that you have um the little wired furry thing she lined the very top so whenever i put it on i could actually pinch the wire to bridge my nose so literally that's how it is um i have two things to go to today i'm going to the drugstore right now to pick up my prescription i have acne medication and another medication and then afterwards i'm going to be going all the way to seattle to pick up the candles dinner really excited okay so i'm in the drugstore right now i look like i'm about to rob a bank but heading to the pharmacy hopefully it's a quick trip in and out everyone's wearing masks and i wonder if you can hear me on my way to candles right now curbside pickup i'll be there in a bit this way i'm here to pick up for jerome uh i can open the trunk from the back thank you okay you're reset great thanks you too so i just got home i'm heating up some water because every time as a routine coming home i remove the filter from the face mask and i toss it in the trash and then i pretty much boil my face mask submerge it with boiling water so that it kills what kills whatever it is on here and then um then i wash it with soap and then i kind of hang it to dry but let me show you guys what we got this is the grand finale we finally got our box from canvas i'm really excited to show you guys what we got let's open it up together so this is what it looks like when you open the box you get a whole oh you get a nice little tulip with a bingo card let me read this really quick so there are two bingo cards wait one two three there are four so apparently every friday as this is happening there's going to be a old-fashioned family fun game that's live stream and uh you are able to participate and potentially win a 100 candleless gift card there's also a nice little menu with a tulip that's so cute and a little note that says thank you for allowing us the opportunity to serve you in your home your dinner tonight is fully cooked so everything here is cooked i ended up getting nana nana's italian sausage with caramelized onions and peppers there's also creamy and cinnamills polenta the famous peter candles salad it has mint oregano scallion romano cheese tomatoes bacon croutons and dressing there is a cannellini bean and root vegetable ragu brioche rolls and the dessert i know there's like five or six different things on this menu is a pavlova with raspberry rose and pistachio and between 6 and 9 p.m which it just turns six right now there is a live pianist live streaming in their restaurant because we can't be there in person there is a live pianist um if you've ever been to candles you already know that the vibe and ambiance of being in there just it's just so classy so um you want to dress up and they they have a live penis they've i will say they've played top 40 hits and i've loved it there's also uh directions as to how to heat this up in the oven i also want to say i ended up getting a bottle of wine in addition they also they had this um we had this special where you could raid the seller and i talked to the sommelier um as to like what do you think pairs well with the sausage and she recommended the curly sellers syrah from yakima valley um so we ended up getting a bottle of that really excited try that out you guys they are live streaming the piano on youtube so we're gonna play this in our big screen this is awesome so i've preheated the oven to 325 degrees to put i'm assuming this is the italian sausage with the caramelized onions and i think there's peppers in there too and then i'm going to put the cannellini bean and root vegetable ragu into this pan and then heat it up on medium is what they're saying i want to get every little bit out of this ah that's so cool medium so this is the creamy polenta we are going to put it in the saucepan oh it's like a little jello i wonder if i should like kind of smash this i don't eat polenta that often but i think it's a little bit less gelatinous and more kind of looking mashed potatoey so we'll get that heated up okay so the oven has already finished preheating let's go ahead and see what the sausage and the main course looks like  this looks amazing so we have to put it in here for about 10 to 12 minutes they're saying so we're gonna just stick it in there as for the salad i think what i'm gonna do is transfer it into this bowl got the peter candles salad we just got to put the dressing on in a bit let's put this down here okay so everything is already set let's show you guys our table so we ended up plating everything in our own dishware but uh got the polenta the bean ragu the brioche buns the peter cat peter cannless salad the nana's italian sausage with the onions and bell peppers and the syrup we'll show you guys the dessert afterwards so excited the sommelier recommended this specific wine for the park oh my gosh so we ended up putting it in our own individual plates like i said they didn't have a option for three servings so we just got two and uh it's actually a lot of food so we're gonna eat up and show you dessert after this there is flowers so the dessert is a pavlova there's a crisp on top that is being separated from the sheets so let's just we can just do that on top oh that's pretty okay yay so got our dessert thoughts pretty good she's floral she's floral if you like rose she's the girl for you it's actually good because the entire dinner was very on the heavy side great polenta polenta amazing amazing amazing the salad amazing even better so having something a little bit on the lighter side actually feels quite nice and oh i wonder how it tastes with the with the wine i think i'm going to end today's vlog i hope you guys enjoyed today's what i eat in a day vlog such a random video but i thought you know we're here at home what else to do but to show you guys our day-to-day life i assume that this pandemic and lockdown is going to be somewhat constant this is going to be the new normal for a little bit and i assume that candles will be doing the delivery service um for a little while i'll leave a link to all of that down below if you guys are interested in the canless delivery dinner
