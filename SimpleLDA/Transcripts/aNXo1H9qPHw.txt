 hi everyone welcome back to another video of mine yes makeup repeater outfit repeater it is day one of the lockdown actually so I didn't really expect for all of these things to happen in a short period of time but I'm glad that action is being taken already just to prevent and kill this virus this disease hoping and praying for the safety of everyone and my project for this day one is actually fix this corner right over here that's what I'm gonna do I'm also going to clean that up and don't worry because we are back on track like what else is my excuse but of course we're gonna be studying online too so that's still going to depend but uh hang out with me we're gonna clean my room together the babe cave and that is something that I had was like supposed to fix last time but I'm proud to say that my other closet I was able to fix that so let's get started this is the before of my room I'm gonna give you guys like okay I know I know what you're gonna say no it's that yeah what's the U was that calm down calm down just goes to show I'm not perfect obviously I'm not but like I am gonna fix that these are actually clothes that I haven't worn yet the urn you got them on sale and so many things that I have to work on I still have John Ray's Valentine's gifts over there and some products I know like why is this happening okay we're gonna keep this like super organized I oh girl my legs my shorts are like really short okay so anyway we're gonna clean this all up figure it all out and throw the things that you don't really need and give it away so let me grub let me turn this off first cuz I just finished filming I'm gonna spill this watch okay yeah success okay all right guys so before I even you know do something in my babe cave I just wanted to show you guys the hangers that I have purchased before the chaos and I purchased this last I believe that was like last week there was already like a corona virus outbreak however it wasn't really as intense as so this past few days you know it's been really crazy and I'm just so glad that I was able to go out and get ever get everything that I can before you know this whole thing happened because I really don't want to go out just in case you know we don't have any classes I still have some classes and I don't know what's the workaround on that but these are some of the hangers that I bought it is from Burlington and this is four dollars and 99 these are the velvet ones and it comes in 12 pieces and we all know that the reason why they are expensive is because they are colored compared to like the ones that are just like plastic and I actually wanted to be just practical and get the plastic ones however John ray said like you know what in the future if you're going to have your walk-in closet I wanted it to look really nice and I think that was like the sweetest thing because he knows that I wanted to have like you know like a big walk-in closet though yeah so this is that I have 24 pieces of that I actually wanted the pink ones but pink ones they really look dirty so I ended up purchasing these ones I'm not mad at it I love the gold handle and I really love this soft purple and if you can hear princess in the background I assure you that he is not being you know she just wants attention that's how she is like she gets she tries to get what she wants on the dot at the time like even if you're doing something she just you know wants attention it's time so no she's not being abused okay so this one is 25 pieces and let me see this one is my I believe this is 999 something like that okay there we go so I'm gonna use this one to hang my clothes and you're probably wondering like oh you're on the floor we do not use shoes in our carpet as much as possible we try to be clean as much as we can and I just um you know like Shh um they call that I just cleaned the carpet i vacuumed there we go so off to or you know what I'm just gonna bring the clothes here in like hey guys we are about to eat this $2 $2 rental noodles Johnny's getting mad cuz I'm just trying his charger yeah my charger on top of that this is good hopefully it is guys I just noticed that when it comes to this noodles it definitely has a lot of corn and the corn on this knodel pack is definitely realistic but the taste of the soup and the noodles it's not extraordinary it it oh my gosh no hey guys so these are the clean laundry is exhausting I'm going to fold them organize them store them away and I think I need you know a lot of baskets for like the white and colored if you guys have any idea how to make white clothes like super white please do let me know so this is the progress right now and it's insane obviously even if you know just two people around here but um this happens so some of these are just going to be folded and some are going to be in a hanger close the first batch of colorant dirty clothes are already there in the washer now after that I'm gonna pop it here to dry so three more batches to go and after that I was like I can relax alright guys so our room is finally clean and that's just probably it really looks it's kind of messy and I like it like that floor is clean too vacuumed and airing out my babe cave is also clean and I didn't remove the setup because we're gonna be filming alright guys so this is what my room looks like now I'm so satisfied on how this cleaning project turned out so I'm thinking of painting my nails next maybe I'll just paint my nails tomorrow and in the meantime I'll enjoy the rest of my day with my doggies so this is pebbles she was tiny for a very short period of time she's a German Shepherd mix as princess and this is Sparky so I'll see you guys on the next video have a good day stay safe bye
