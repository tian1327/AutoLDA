  good morning guys and welcome to another vlog I guess today I'm going to be doing a day in my life quarantine Edition and since I'm stuck inside don't mind my appearance my hair is like really messy I basically just got up ate breakfast as you guys saw and I've just been doing work I just actually uploaded my boyfriend tag video so if you haven't watched that already make sure to check it out I'm gonna be working out here in a little bit I've been writing down my to-do list as you can see here not sure what the rest of the day holds but I'll be sure to bring you guys along so guys this is our makeshift gym right now since obviously we can't go to the gym it's actually the pool house but here is a treadmill I'm basically just going to be running for a while maybe do a little weight and then I usually do like some leg workouts Spencer does pretty much the same thing but not as much shining so let's get to it   yes then you know I walked away at fathom person I had become you should go back once one so now if he should keep this road you feel like the man in that really kind of look like I don't know like the average dad that's in every movie you know I feel like every dad and every like yeah family movie comes out in the morning wearing this straight through behind the tie but not really so I just finished doing my makeup I'm just wearing like a really comfy outfit today this is actually Spencer's hoodie and my Lululemon sweatpants now I'm about to make the bed real quick just because I didn't make it this morning I just went straight to work and I also need to pick up around the room a little bit as you guys can see it's a little bit messy alright guys so it's a little bit later I have been sitting here editing this video for the longest time I finally finished it and went ahead and uploaded it it's not live yet if you guys are kind of interested in how like brand collaborations work basically I had to go ahead edit the video and upload it as though I was making it live but just leave it as unlisted basically the lady I'm working with for this princess Polly collaboration has to view it and approve it and then I can make it live so I just finished it if you guys haven't seen it already make sure to go check it out I'm pretty sure this will be live before the vlog you're watching now yeah so I think it turned out really good I'm pretty proud of it we actually went to a story apart to film the try important of the video so yeah I put a lot of effort into it and would really appreciate it if you guys would go watch it and give it a thumbs up so now I think I'm just going to kind of hang out and chill for a little bit it's actually already like 5:30 like I said I haven't talked to you guys and so long I've just been really busy editing and all of that and getting that video up and taken care of so I think in about half an hour we're gonna go down and eat dinner I'm getting really hungry so I'm really looking forward to that and then also I think after dinner we're gonna go down in the basement and organize all of our inventory for my consignment website which is broke fish bargains so if you guys haven't checked it out you should go check it out I'll have it listed down below you can just click the link and go see what we have for sale yeah so basically with this whole coronavirus thing since we are stuck inside which hopefully you guys are staying inside too it's definitely best to just stay away from people I know it's like tempting to go to your friend's house and like hang out but it's just like better for everybody if you just stay inside and the sooner we can isolate ourselves the sooner hopefully this thing will pass I know it can be frustrating and boring but right now we just have to do what's best for the world because even though like you might not get affected too much there are people that I'm sure in your lives that could I'm not really looking forward to organizing that's one thing we've put off so now is the time to kind of do that and i really suggest to for that you guys just like take this time to do things that you never have the time to do I know like even with us like we work from home so we kind of come up with our own schedules but it's still so tempting to just leave and get out of the house so I feel like now we have so much extra time to really work on projects and things that we have been needing to do but just keep pushing off and that's what we've been using this time for and really just keeping busy yesterday was to be honest like the first day and probably months that we didn't watch a single TV show or movie just because we literally worked all day like worked out we hung out with his family a little bit and played a few like board games which I feel like nobody plays anymore so I just think it's cool like seeing how everybody's finding ways to keep busy I saw this thing on Twitter where this couple actually got rollerskates and we're rollerblading in their kitchen which I thought was really cool and I told Spencer that we need order a pair off Amazon now just for something to do I'm gonna go come up with some video ideas comment down below and let me know if you guys have any requests because like I said I'm trying to upload for 30 days and it's kind of hard coming up with enough ideas so let me know what you guys want to see in the comments down below also I think tonight I'm gonna try this mask I bought it like a week ago about a week ago um sorry but it's the dr. jart shake and shot rubber firming mask and I've seen this like before but I never bought it I actually picked it up at Marshall's it was only $5.99 so I figured I'd give it a try I just think it's so cool-looking and it's supposed to make your face look rubbery and I don't know I just thought it was fun and I'd give it a try since it was on sale I love Marshalls and I miss it I miss Marshalls very much so for now this is kind of how we're organizing I know it doesn't look like we have that much but believe me there's actually over 500 items but that's not including shoes and also like bigger items like coats and maxi dresses we have those in the closet so right now we're just kind of storing my letter so for example this dress is by the brand the sister Jane so I'm just going to fold it and put it in the bin  all right so we finished cleaning the basement and getting all organized now we're just upstairs we're like hanging out and talking for a little bit and now I just made a zoom meeting so I can FaceTime my family what's up guys so I'm actually coming to you live from the bathroom sitting on the toilet but now I'm not using it real quick I want to show you guys how cute my pajamas are they're from Victoria's Secret I said they're adorable it's like a little sleeping romper I just got off of zoom I was talking to my family from back home and it was really nice I miss them so much and thankfully if they're all really healthy as of right now for mckernon virus but I figured before we go to bed I really want to try out this mask and when's amount of time to do it then when I'm vlogging so figured we'd go ahead and try it out I still need to take off my makeup so pretty sure you need a clean skin before you do a face mask so I'm gonna take my makeup off I don't use like any certain light this is just like the Target brand on the pink grapefruit set so I'm gonna do that real quick and while I'm doing that I'm gonna go ahead and grab my face wash this is the face wash I use at night and then I use the orange one during the day I think they've helped clear up my skin quite a bit my skin's not perfect as you'll see I just basically washed my face with those two things one at night one in the morning and then as for my acne I just put tea tree oil on it but I also before I put the tea tree oil on it I use an astringent and also like cotton rounds and make sure we get all of the makeup off of my face   now it's time to do the mask like I said my face is red from the astringent and also just my acne it looks like basically all I do is mix number one and two together cover the pool with my finger shake it and put it on so I'm really excited about I think it's time I want to show you guys what it looks like basically it just looks like a shake to be honest kind of see where they get the name okay so I'm gonna take this spatula I'm not trying to look in the viewfinder what put this line  another facemask and still alone I have another mouse key I really want to try brand it is but it's more like a high-end brand I mean this one was expensive like don't get me wrong I think originally it's like 20 dollars which is ridiculous for a masking is literally one time like skin care it's the one thing that's just so expensive I've been wanting to try like the drunk elephant products I heard those really really good but I just can't bring myself to spend money on it so let me know if you guys have tried any of it I think like almost all their things so we're like $80 it's like for a small model and it's just like so hard when you bring myself but I've heard their serums are really good I'm just so simple when it comes to skincare because I've always had problematic skin since I was in like from middle school and I just don't like to put a lot different topics on my face because I just find that so many of them break me out also I thought about trying cure ology for my acne let me know you guys think obviously like a lot of influencers work with them I mean if I work with them I thought it would be sponsored just because I feel like I'm not large enough and fluence are they've never reached out to me and I only really like to do sponsored videos and collapse with brands that I know my trust for the same reason that every influencer status is like I want you guys to trust me even this like doing a review but thought it wasn't sent to me so if I absolutely hate it I  think I'm gonna have some extra do you want to do it I think it's supposed to be one of those like rubber peel off ones that you've been lying to do okay okay guys so now not only is it my honest review but you even have my boyfriend's work again dutifully everyone okay your turn you're gonna sit down this is a wash my face first or something oh yeah you probably should so this is the movie I was talking about it's called what happened to Monday we're gonna go ahead and watch it we got some cereals cut up a banana our face masks they're starting to peel so we know that is in fact going to get off alright so it's time to take the masks off and we're just gonna do it in bed there's like a giant wall near right here oh so cool I can feel it like you know those little hairs that are just on your hand you feel them sticking to it it's like so satisfying it's not like harsh there's nothing no yeah did you ever like you civil um like stick your finger in like hot candle wax oh did you ever do that probably yeah it always felt so like soft on your fingers that it's kind of like actually yeah so I would recommend this mask if you just want to try it for fun and like one a fun little peel-off mask that's for the benefits like I feel anything right now it moisturizes something oh my gosh I should do a video of Spencer reviewing my products okay I'm gonna go wash my face catch up with you guys later and then I'm probably a man in the vlog cuz I'm tired
