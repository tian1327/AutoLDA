 where everyone my name is Noah and I have a new face if you had not seen my hair go and Instagram yet I'm sorry for the scare and I hope that you take some time to recover as approximately 80% of the gay population who's currently on lockdown I decided to either dye my hair or shave my head so this happened as you saw the title I decided to be filming a quarantine Sunday vlog nothing crazy planned today I just know that I struggle a lot to find things to keep myself entertained and busy since we've been on lockdown and I thought that maybe filming would be a good thing for me and also sharing some of my activities and hobbies with you might help you deal with your own time you will notice throughout the day that I am completely unable to stop rubbing my head because it feels really good but yeah so right now I woke up it's kind of late I went to bed pretty late last night because it was playing at a mall crossing and totally I'm still in bed I'm reviewing the last version of the Hawaii vlog part 2 she'll go up in about an hour and after that I'm just gonna get up hop in the shower real quick because I cannot start my day if I don't shower or else that's gonna be a lazy day you already know so I'm gonna shower first and eat some breakfast and then I will reconnect with you guys  so if you follow me on instagram you probably saw that I decided that I was gonna be doing the no shape quarantine thing this obviously only applies to the beard because the head got some C used trimming in the past week but I'm out of the shower I put on my uniform which is basically a black tank top with black gym shorts I've been wearing that basically every day for the past two weeks I know everyone always say is trying to dress in the morning and like get ready as if you were gonna spend your whole day at work but I just don't work like that I rather to be comfortable and at least I have clothes on which doesn't happen every day but right now I just posted the Hawaii vlog and I'm about to make some breakfast it's 12:00 I'm gonna make some banana toast so I just put like a piece of toast with some butter I cut up some bananas put some agave on top and some honey roasted almonds and I'm just gonna eat that I probably I'm gonna play some animal crossing this morning because I made some improvements in my house yesterday night and I really want to see how they turned out and also because my brother and his girlfriends have been wanting to visit my island so I'm just going to do that  so it is now 2:00 p.m. I ended up playing animal crossing with my brother and his girlfriend and facetiming them for approximately two hours but they had a lot to show me they visit in my island I visited theirs it's insane they have so much stuff and they built me some custom furniture if you have no idea what that animal crossing is you're probably very lost right now but you need to catch on because this game is just a really feel good game right now I'm about to do a little at-home workout I've been following this fitness trainer on Instagram called Damon Belle who posts a lot of at home workouts that you can do with no equipment which have been super helpful now that all the gyms in New York City have closed down today is Sunday and I'm gonna do a chest focus workout he calls it hypertrophy because you only work the chest for the entire length of your workout so I'll put the link in the box down below if you guys want to check out his page because they've been super super helpful and keeping me motivated and feeling like I'm on track with something and not just doing stuff in my own apartment now watch me struggle      okay Rajani we did the whole thing my chest is burning hot and I'm really sweaty which makes me happy because it means I was actually working out so I'm gonna head and take a shower and then I will make some lunch give him hungry it's about to be three so we should probably eat lunch so I took a quick shower and started doing laundry because I'm running out of everything and put on a different pair of shorts and a different tank top told you that was the uniform this week I was going to make lunch but I opened the fridge and realized that I basically am running out of everything that I usually eat for lunch or dinner or all the time so I'm going to go ahead and place an order on Amazon this is how we've been getting our food delivered our groceries we just order them on Amazon Whole Foods and then get them delivered so we don't have to go outside since we're supposed to stay inside so I'm gonna go ahead and do that and then I have some turkey slices left so I'm just gonna eat that while I bake because someone sent me a recipe for cheesecake cookies on Twitter and they looked bomb so I'm gonna go ahead and make those I have all my ingredients which are butter brown sugar white sugar eggs vanilla baking soda salt salt and chocolate chips and of course cream cheese to make the Cheesecake part I got almond milk cream cheese because we don't do dairy in this house but yeah I have all my ingredients and we're heating the oven at 350 375 degrees and I will put recipe that I found online in the description box down below if you guys want to recreate those cookies but let me just let me just go ahead and ruin them let's let's just look what I found I realized that sounds smart and actually purchase that cream cheese is actually it if you guys want to try it out it's called like I'm you being a beauty blogger that's level one what's level four six no there's a lot more fluid now so I'm gonna go ahead and start mixing feet no no no so I forgot soft thing of putting pans in the oven as a storage place when we touch so it has been a little over fourteen minutes now and as you can see the edges are starting to be golden so I'm gonna give it one more minute and I'll take them out cuz I'd rather them kind of dry up once they're out of the oven then overcook okay so I put them in the plate and they honestly look amazing I had a little photo shoot with them okay it's very fluffy nice try I could keep eating is there actually really good the chocolate chips are not as melted as they wish they would peace I don't know what I did that prevented that from happening but the consistencies perfect and they really fit so I'm happy so right now I'm just gonna eat a couple and I'm gonna just sit down and I've read a little bit of my book I'm currently reading Aristotle and Dante discover the secrets of the universe which is a book that you guys recommended when I asked for lgbtq+ the novel's on my Instagram story I have a list of books by the way that you guys recommended so I'm just gonna put it next the next frame so you guys can pause and screenshot and go through the list my favorite is red white and royal blue which was such a pleasure to read I could not put the book down and it just made me really happy so if you guys wanna check out any of those books go ahead but I'm just gonna I'm just gonna rest for a little bit and read because I haven't read in a couple days and I miss it  hi there so it is 8:20 p.m. and I just woke up from an unplanned nap that I took on the couch right here I think what I'm going to do is make some beef kiss ideas if we have ground beef because I'm craving that for some reason and then I need to wake up first so Bradley I want to watch tiger King which is that TV show and Netflix that everyone's talking about about that one well these few private zoo owners across the u.s. that just mystery animals and humans and they're just horrible human beings that I started watching last night I watched like two episodes I'm kind of intrigued then everyone's talking about it on Twitter so I'm gonna see what that's about okay so while I am watching this absolutely insane show that Tiger King is I cut up meat me I cut up my avocado I put some ground beef in a pan with some spices and then what I'm gonna do right now and take a creek pin and wiring up a little not too much and low heat and I'm gonna take my tortillas and I'm gonna just put them up on there to warm them up a little I look like an egg what the so I'm just taking my tortillas and just pin them on there just a few seconds to make them a little crispier and warm and toasty put some cheese on my warm tortilla and then I'm gonna scoop out some of that ground beef and put it on top and then I'm just gonna grab it with the whole thing because I'm gonna put some more cheese on top and then it's ready to eat we're just gonna serve it with some avocado and sour cream on the side I think that's basically it for today's vlog I'm gonna eat that and then watch a little bit of this craziness Carol is my experiment and then I'm just gonna head to bed a little early today because I have work tomorrow and I have to wake up early but I hope you enjoyed this little quarantine Sunday vlog routine thing that it gave you some ideas on how to keep yourself busy in this weird weird time but stay safe stay home and try to stay happy I love you guys and I will see you very soon for a new video bye don't shave your head you look weird then
