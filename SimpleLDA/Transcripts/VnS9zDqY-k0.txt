 hi everyone so today is Friday March 20th I thought I would do a little bit of a day in the life since we are all stuck at home right now I'm gonna go walk around my neighborhood right now I want to get my ten thousand Septon for the day only because gyms are closed I'm not a big fan of working out at home after you really hate it but I'm gonna try to force myself to do it today because we definitely need to keep our bodies moving in everything but we're gonna go do that tomorrow's action my mom's birthday so I'm gonna bake her a birthday cake we're gonna come in and do some makeup today because I kind of feel gross oh I definitely want to put myself together I think it will definitely help and I also want to try to film a makeup tutorial for a Monday's video I really am not used to blogging or anything like that but I just finished my workout and my walk and everything it's about 2 o'clock now and I just had a protein shake which I should have filmed but completely forgot to but now I'm gonna go jump in the shower wash my hair get myself ready put a little bit of makeup on just to help feel just try to help myself feel a little bit better and not I will bring the camera downstairs for all of that show you how I'm baking the cake and yeah so let me go shower and I will see you guys in a little bit but do you have some natural light coming in from the window and my ring light on so hopefully the lighting is good it seems good in the viewfinder and soak up any excess with the towel and next just using my wide tooth comb just going to brush and obviously since we're not going anywhere because everybody should be staying home and listening to what they're saying there's no reason to really put heat on my hair so I think this is a good time for me for anybody that puts a lot of heat on their hair maybe give your hair a little bit of a break so I'm gonna just be using a little bit of product to help my natural wavy curls a little bit basically what I'm going to be doing is my drugstore foundation routine which I just put up last week so I will link that video down below I'm just going to talk to you guys a little bit about what's going on and everything and then I'm gonna speed you through the rest of this I'm gonna be doing everything from that video except cream contour because I don't think it's 100% necessary just to start the reason why I am baking my mom's birthday cake and we're not going to buy one first of all I don't even know after today if like cold stone or Carvel in those places are gonna be open I'm not sure if they are considered necessary necessary stores or whatever they're calling it but why when I mentioned earlier in the video that I was babysitting my cousin's son was also my cousin they're having another baby and they're having a baby girl she's doing May and they inferred to be the godmother so me and my cousin her husband we were throwing her a sprinkle for next weekend March 29th but obviously due to everything going on and how to get cancelled and with her due date so close we don't really think we'll be able to squeeze it in again just in case she does go into labor early so basically since we were doing a sprinkle and it was just a smaller baby shower at the house I offered to make the cake I was like oh perfect I don't think it should be that hard i watch some videos on youtube we wanted to do an ombre design I'll throw the picture up from Pinterest that I was using kind of as my in spa now we get my aunt flew in from Florida to come and visit so it was also her birthday that we were celebrating I was like oh perfect I will practice for her birthday and my mom's birthday and by the time the baby shower came I should pretty much be able to be able to get it done and then if not our backup was to just order the cake but now that the sprinkle obviously is cancelled due to everything going on I bought all this stuff at once just in case the stores closed but we still have this sprinkle without realizing so now I have all this extra baking stuff so I figured you know what we'll just do for my mom's birthday also obviously I can't eat it because I am gluten free because I do have celiac but everybody else in my house can eat it and everybody did like it last week so my mom makes me to do it again for her and we're just gonna be doing a yellow ombre because you lost her favorite color so yeah it should be fun I'm going to bake the cake today and do the crumb coat and possibly frost the whole thing if not I'm gonna frost the whole thing with the ombre tomorrow and I will record that I am NOT a professional Baker by any means I just thought it would be fun to make the cake for my cousin make it a little bit a little extra special for her that the cake was coming from me that was the plan for that obviously unfortunately it won't be happening but there are more important things and so obviously we understand and she's not upset about it because she knows obviously she needs to stay safe for her her son who's gonna be three on April first and obviously the newborn who is due in May which I am so excited about I've gotten hurt such cute clothes I'm so excited but yeah so that's why we're baking the cake because I have all the extra stuff since we're not doing the sprinkle anymore and who knows how long we'll have to stay home for I might be baking some cupcakes in some other stuff throughout the next few weeks to keep me occupied and it was actually I made so I used box cakes mix obviously because I don't really know how to make a cake cake but I did make homemade buttercream frosting and it really was not as hard as you would think it is it was fairly easy you just have to order like a scraper to scrape the icing around the cake on and it probably I bought it on Amazon I'm pretty sure it was under $20 so if you're ever interested in getting into baking I mean now is your time to start a new hobby you have a lot of time on your hands I also want to say now is a good time to like go through your makeup collection cleaning all your makeup brushes get all that stuff organized and everything everybody's houses are gonna be so organized after all this alright I am going to that was everything I think I wanted to like update you guys on and everything so I'm gonna speed you through the rest of my makeup routine and I will be back Alexa playing music by Luke combs like I said I do want to keep my eyes blank because I do want to film a tour later so that's gonna be it for the face just gonna set it in place it's T's for when I want to film later and yeah so my hair is still a little too wet but I'm just gonna part it and throw the product and now because I wanna my battery I only have two bars so I wanna give it a little time to charge while I maybe sit down and get some homework done because I do still have online class for my masters and that way the battery is charged for when I wanna film doing the cake so I'm just gonna throw a little bit of this trust me curl renewal and it's definitely expired I've had it for years I need to buy more of it but we're just gonna put a little bit in mainly focusing on like our top suction cuz that's really the hair that gets frizzy astana and this will just help the curls because like I said I want to try to maybe avoid using heat as much as I can right now I will see you guys in a little while to start off with the cake I am just using a devil's food cake cake mix box from Pillsbury when I went shopping for everything this was one of the only chocolate cake mixes that they had left because that is my anti favorite kind of cake and then I'm just following the directions on the back using vegetable oil and in place of eggs I did use Greek yogurt because we are trying to conserve everything food wise that we have I didn't want to waste three eggs on the cake mix so next I'm just using the same measuring cup that I use for everything else which was 1/4 and just filling the fourth inch cake pans with the batter so the cakes are roughly around the same height and thickness and then I am just working on some schoolwork while the cakes are in the oven and we will see you when they come out okay guys so my battery wasn't done charging so I wanted to leave it up there for when I film my makeup tutorial so the cakes just finished baking and came out of the oven so now I'm gonna leave them to cool and while I'm waiting for them to cool I'm gonna make the first round of the buttercream frosting that I'm going to use to do the crumb coat with and then tomorrow I hope we're gonna do the crumb coat tonight and then the full-on braid frosting tomorrow so I'm gonna give the cakes a little while to cool I finished my essay I just have to do my cover page and running head and by the time I'm done with that we'll start making the buttercream frosting and I will show you all how I do that it's really simple really easy you only need a few ingredients and I have the recipe printed so I'll show you where I got the recipe from as well obviously give credit to that Baker who posted it for the buttercream frosting I got my recipe from recipes by Karina and I will leave the direct link in the description box below for you guys if you would like to use this one that I did it is very simple all you need is one cup of butter three cups of powdered sugar one teaspoon of vanilla and two tablespoons of milk and basically all you're going to do is take these softened butter that has been out for a few hours before it makes it a lot easier you're gonna put it in a really big bowl and using a mixer a stand mixer or a handheld mixer you're just going to beat it for five minutes until it is a light color and it's about doubled in size then you're going to gradually add the sugar 1/2 a cup to a cup at a time until it's each well incorporated and then once all the sugar is in you're gonna add the vanilla and the milk just to loosen it up a little bit and for everything that I did I doubled all my recipes so now that the frosting is done we were just layering our cakes that they are semi cooled you will hear the issue that I ran into right about now so my cake is in the fridge chilling I didn't put the crumb coat on yet because I think they were still a little bit warm so they were kind of sliding all over the place I threw them in the fridge to cool I don't think I would have a time to film I just wanted a but that's okay we'll just do it tomorrow and we'll get it up by Monday we're back up in my bedroom as you can see from the footage I just inserted my cake completely fell apart we just borrowed a mini fridge from one of our neighbors cuz our fridge is kind of small it doesn't really fit a lot and I'm pretty sure New York is going on some kind of lockdown and they really don't want leaving your house and my mom wants to really start limiting us to going out to the public stores and everything so they my dad went out to go suck up on a few last things so before you came home with all the groceries I was like oh perfect I'll put the cake in there to chill so I can do the crumb coat but I think my cake it wasn't cooled a hundred percent so it was still kind of warm and melting the butter cream obviously because it is made up of two cups of butter and so it just completely fell apart I'm gonna try my best to save it I do have another box of cake mix but this already took me almost three hours to do and I'm not even done with it so if I have to obviously I will redo it again tomorrow but I'm gonna try to save what we have because I really hate wasting food especially now with everything going on I really don't want to waste it and I did work really hard on what I've had so far and I'm really upset about it but what can you do I think I'm gonna let the pieces that we were able to salvage which was about three of them I kind of try to put them back together I'm gonna try my best to salvage that I'm gonna let those cool leave it alone and the video for today here I'm definitely gonna pick it back up tomorrow since the cake was a fail and depending on if we redo it or not I definitely want to show you guys like I said I'm not a professional Baker I also did use four inch pans this time so I also don't know if it was too tall and obviously I didn't put anything in them like wood to help them stay I don't know I'm just doing this at home so I have to say I'm gonna link the buttercream frosting recipe down below it's delicious I keep stealing some so definitely try the buttercream frosting out it is delicious I highly recommend it what I did while I was still drawing was hook at the top layer and I kind of throw it up if you guys saw in like that half a pipe down like a messy bun so it really curled these top pieces because they were looking a little really frizzy and I was like oh I think I just made a huge mistake by leaving my hair natural but I am really happy with the way came out and since like I said I did just get my hair cut I have these shorter layers I have to keep it over it to the side so yeah so I don't I think I'm just gonna leave the cake alone for tonight and then we will re-evaluate the situation in the morning if I have to bake it again and not use the four inch pans and use just regular 8 inch cake pans I will do that and we'll just go from there so with that being said I will see you guys tomorrow good morning everybody it is Saturday March 21st so it's officially weekend one in quarantine so I think I'm gonna do like a weekend in my life kind of thing tomorrow we don't really have anything planned because not my mom birth or anything but today is so we're gonna have dinner and I'm gonna try to fix this cake it literally woke me up out of my sleep with anxiety that it's a mess and I have to try to fix it somehow so I woke up a little while ago I'll show you I put a tablecloth on the table for my mom's birthday with her present and I hung a little sign up just to try to make you feel a little bit special because I know we've all kind of been anxious about what's going on and everything so we want to try to make this as stress-free anxiety free and as special as we can given the circumstances for her so like I said I just woke up a little while ago I might go on another walk today I'm just trying to get my steps in I don't know if I want to do a workout yet today because I think I need to reevaluate how I'm gonna be working out at home because I haven't been loving it and yeah so that's the plan for right now I'm so sorry for the abrupt ending I did not realize that while I was editing I've been having a lot of issues adding this vlog all day long a lot of the clips were filmed on my phone and you did not want to transfer over to my computer so it's been very stressful but I'm happy I was able to get everything so to fix the cake we're going to start by making the buttercream frosting again we're going to be making another batch of it and we're doubling the recipe so we're using two cups of butter six cups of sugar and all that kind of good stuff so I'm just working and mixing all that together now this frosting will be divided up into three equal parts so one of the parts will be the darkest yellow the next part will be a lighter yellow and then the last one will be white you can definitely do four different shades of yellow or whatever color you would like but this was just what I did and obviously you guys know the cake fell apart so it's not also gonna be perfectly even as well it kind of has a dome shape to it and yeah so now I'm just using a kitchen scale and I'm roughly measuring out I think was about 275 grams of frosting I just wanted to kind of make it even even though I really have no idea what I'm doing I just thought it would make it a little bit easier and obviously the frosting is so good that you just have to lick something off your fingers so now for the darkest shadow I'm just putting the most amount of drops of food coloring that mixing it around until I get the desired color and then we're gonna do the same thing for the lighter shade of yellow as well we're just using a smaller amount of food coloring drops for this one now everything I purchased to make this cake with besides like the food stuff but like all the piping bags and the swirling cakes and everything was purchased on Amazon in a kit so I can look that down below for you guys if you're interested so first I'm just using not using I am filling my piping bags with the frosting and I saw this trick I think either on Pinterest or YouTube you put the bag down in a cup and it helps you fill the piping bags a lot easier so I'm just taking all three colors and filling them in the piping bags with the little insert thing to help you pipe it I don't know the technical terms I am not kidding I literally taught myself how to do this on youtube last weekend and this was my second time making a cake like this so cut me some slack it's definitely work in progress and I do really enjoy doing this and also if you see something weird poking out of my shirt I wear like a waist trainer to help hold me in so now here is my not perfectly straight cake so basically using the turntable that the cake is on you're going to pipe the darker shade first or the lightest whatever you want to do but I started with the darkest and you're going to go around it until you want to stop pretty much so I went I think almost half way only because we had so much frosting and I wanted you to really see the color of it and then after you pipe the darkest around and you think that you're done you're going to take your lighter shade of yellow and then do the same entire thing all the way around until you want to stop I went back and forth a few times I didn't know where I wanted to stop especially because it's so uneven towards the top but I kept going with the yellow pretty much all the way to the top and then the very very top of the cake we left white and then you will see how I decorated the deformed shape of the top of the cake at the end so now you're going to take a scraper I'm not sure if that's the technical term or not and you're just going to slowly scrape along the side of the cake and you're going to wipe off any excess frosting that you have on the side of a bowl or on a paper towel or anything and yeah that's pretty much it it's really really easy and then after you've scraped it around a few times if you have any gaps or holes you can go in with more frosting and fill them in so like I'm doing here I'm just filling in any gaps and then you're gonna go around and scrape it again until you pretty much get your a desired look there are also a ton of different ways you can go about fixing it if it's not perfectly straight all around I do go around a few times trying to get those kind of little lines where you stop with the scraper if that makes sense but you could look those up on YouTube because I have no idea how to do it so now I'm just piping white and as you can see we have another big fail the piping bag did break and a nice big chunk of it on the side of the cake but I just went over it with the yellows again and just scraped it all around and it was perfectly fine so that is the only thing with the this Amazon package I would say is the piping bags are a little on the cheaper side but for my purposes they work perfectly fine that was the 6th or 7th piping bag I use and that was the only issue that I found with it so other than that I really do like this kid I recommend to anybody just starting out and wanting to kind of get their feet a little wet and just seeing if you like it or if you want to do it as a hobby while you're bored in quarantine I highly recommend it once again I'm just going around the sides of the cake with the scraper one last time trying to get as smooth as possible for a beginner and now I'm just going over and smoothing out the top of the cake which was the hardest I think because it obviously wasn't a straight line or edge it was kind of curved over like a dome shape like I said so yeah I just piped on top mom with some hearts just to kind of distract away from the awkward shape and this is the final cake I am pretty happy with the outcome and everybody said that it was super delicious and that is all that matters
