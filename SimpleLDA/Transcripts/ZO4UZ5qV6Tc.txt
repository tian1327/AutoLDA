 crew scheduling guards were on my side   hello everybody and welcome back to my channel or if you're new here welcome to my channel my name is Kat and I am a flight attendant for a major US airline y'all know the drill I kind of just talk to y'all just really quick so basically this is the day before I go back to no I was on call today what am I talking about okay so today I went back on call I pretty much slept through my entire on collar pit started out like 2 a.m. and ended at 2 p.m. I think I went to sleep at 2 a.m. and I didn't wake up until like 11 I am yeah it's been pretty bad lately so tomorrow I actually am good for 3 days so it's still the beginning of the month but I actually have standby tomorrow and it's another weird standby time I think it's 5 we do military time so you got to give me a minute to calculate and stuff out so it's at 1700 3 so it's at 503 hopefully we can get a trip you know even I don't know what's going on yeah I just really want to fly I miss line and like how am I supposed to have a paid vacation without a trip you know what I mean I have been living for these warmers I have one warmer in my kitchen and then obviously one right here in the living room it makes my whole house smell like a bakery it is just ridiculously good anything that's gonna basically smell like fresh baked pastries I'm here for basically just over on YouTube right now I'm about to make this video public which is actually pretty funny I did a reacting to five-minute crafts you know that huge crafting channel and reacted to some of their travel hacks so if you want a good laugh in some shock you should definitely go check that figure out obviously since we haven't been flying as much I've been trying to do a little bit of different content I know so many of you all thought that gender video was funny I don't know I just kind of want to play around with stuff and see what works see what doesn't see what y'all like see what y'all don't so yeah definitely go check some of those interesting videos out and let me know what y'all are vibing with what you're not vibing with but was over here sleepy he's so tired he was stressed out cause he had a vet appointment plus a haircut yesterday who's there for so long but he's looking super cute we put a bandana on her earlier    okay so I'm all packed I did a little different I have at my in flight shoes at first I put my other shoes in there and I totally forgot I'm just not gonna wear my uniform until I get to the airport and then over there I put some clothes so this is actually what I'm gonna wear to the airport there we go I'm good to go - all of my makeup stuff  I did look at Jeff here good he doesn't understand acoustics usually I would pack some meals but this there's such a small chance of me actually flying it doesn't really make sense to pack meals right now so we're not going to do that I'm just like totally loving like the organization right now and then Nespresso actually does this really cool thing with like the leftover pod so you can put them in bags like this and then they go ahead and compost them and then the aluminum is recycled which is really cool so we just fill up like these big bags every time we get and then just go drop them off and it's free shipping then we also have our milk frother over here which I don't actually use that very much but it's still kind of cool and then in this drawer here we keep all of the packages and then in here we have like the leftover pods so we can just go ahead and refill this and keep it organized I know y'all are gonna come for me but I love swing low so yeah  it's another you can  bah-bah you're on the couch I think getting all the love in this morning oh you say hi good morning everybody hope you have a cup of coffee or something to drink so a little bit a change of plans when we get to the airport so right now it is 1022 I need to touch my phone how to do not disturb but I actually got a message from my manager she has some information for me so I have to go meet with her which means it's probably smarter just to already be in my uniform because I don't know how long that's going to take so we might go to the airport a little bit early does it unexplained for y'all cuz I'm sure you only might cat you have a manager like I thought flood tents were their own boss I could hand managers and that's generally for the most part pretty true like when you're on the plane itself you don't have a manager it's just you you're your own boss but we do have flight managers there kind of there in case we need any help with anything or in case we're going through something we have somebody to talk to you on the other end of the spectrum if you get in trouble your manager is probably who we usually reach out my manager is so nice I have a brand new one obviously since I came to Dallas but she is such a sweetheart it's such a beautiful day I love to just like come hang out we have like a patio set out here and I see I set up to just come sit out here and chill at the weather is beautiful it's just a nice refresh restart to my head you know what I mean just to get out and in the nature feel the normal fresh air it's about to be 1 o'clock so I'm super hungry I want to get something to eat before we go do the standby shift I also need to run by CVS and get some makeup wipe remover remember how much tan body shift starts at 5:03 p.m. last flight leaves the airport at 6 so basically after the last flight leaves I'm going to call crew schedule and try and be released now let's go get something to eat  who can agree with me that CBS gives like the world's longest receipt I do love their coupon flow okay so I totally forgot to tell y'all today is Mother's Day if you're going to be a flight of tonight you're gonna have to just get used to working on holidays I was supposed to go over to her house and have a nice Mother's Day dinner but just thought I would tell you also since we're sitting in this line and it is not moving I figured let's go ahead and call mama bear and tell her happy Mother's Day well we got nothing better to do I think she's not gonna pick up she's like sorry lady I'm busy I got plans you're grown Chi an answer up but we're moving up I was wondering if I can have two fajita chicken salads with no beans we got the goods and we are finally on our way home  so we just got off the phone with my husband's mom because she actually answers her phone so gonna end up eating this and then start getting ready for the airport these brothers my guys know that me flat know that the ride or dad I keep playing on my side CJ I rode with I stole these buddies my know that if lash know that the rider  okay so ended up opening this up and grabbed a whole uniform out of here and then my makeup bags will just throw that in here I guess we need to take these out and then go ahead and put my other tennis shoes and outfit I'm gonna go ahead and stick that in here put these back in that shoe bag with the deodorizers I always keep my shoe bag and my apron up towards the top of this or I'll put them in my carry-on which actually after I finished doing this I have to go switch out my carry-on because my bag broke in the zipper which I'll show you in just a minute so this is my main key blue bag and this is my Nomad line bag I've gotten a lot of questions lately from y'all asked me like which bag is better y'all keep seeing this one so I must prefer this one and the truth be told it's like I'm lazy and this one has just been packed with my stuff and so yeah it's easy to grab so if y'all want a video where I compare my two bags of what I like and don't like about them in case you're interested in buying one and you want my opinion on the differences let me know because I can film that I broke this bag so the side zipper over here um I said this one that's bizarre okay so I thought I broke this because like the last time on my last trip when we were getting out of the car my husband showed me and it was broke I don't know that's weird okay well it seems to be working but since I've already got all this stuff laid out anyways let's go ahead and just pack this one up plus since I'm not bringing my cooler bag this one has smaller straps so it sits on the j-hook better this one has like taller straps so it seems to drag on the ground and I never want to hang it by the straps because they're smaller whereas this is like thicker and sturdier but once again if you all want differences of the bag and some stuff that they like about this and stuff I like about this some stuff I would change like let me know cuz I can totally do that but I'm not gonna be using my cooler bag and I'm gonna have the one carry-on over here so it just makes the most sense to go ahead and keep that bag on the j-hook because then that makes the suitcase feel so much lighter  okay so it's 3:20 gonna leave here any minute well like 40 minutes so I'm gonna go ahead and take three of these hair skin and nails and I'm also going to go ahead and take multivitamin okay four of them are stuck together so we're just taking four or whatever take the prescribed amount don't with them too many kids look who answered happy Mother's Day okay so we are on the way to the airport my husband brought some fishing poles so he's gonna find like a local pond to the airport and fishing for a little bit and hopefully they released me he'll already be in the area so you just skedaddle on out of there if not he'll probably go fish for bait and then when they give me the big card no he'll go back home and then come back and get me later  all right we are here we took the big truck so it's loud and that's gonna be a long way down and some heels  okay so I am in the airport right now I just got out of my meeting with my manager and I just say like I just thought my company like I really love my company I love the people that work for my company the extra support is so nice but anyways enough of that that went great what time is it now 5:20 I'm sweating I went to go get some new crew tags for my back so I got some cute little Dallas crew tags let me see if I can get him out and show you all so I went and called the cute little fruit tags IPFW and paint I think they're so adorable okay so I got two of the DFW ones and then I got a pink coin that says I crew with a little plane I had like these old ones like this and obviously they are just beaten up and like literally the thing is so broken I know it's bad it's that your hotel me I know but anyways I felt like I needed some new crew tags you know breaking in the new base I'm so excited I'm sweating because I hustled all the way down there because I didn't know if they were gonna be open or not auguste blast buys leaves out of here at 7-eleven not at six I actually broke the wheel on my suitcase one of them doesn't work and needs to be replaced I'm not exactly sure which one its Dragon and squeaking so bats I'm gonna go squeak my way over to find something okay so I actually just went over to like the 7-eleven right there don't know if y'all can see it but ended up getting let's see zero sugar Powerade the blue ones the best one I also got a power crunch bar gotta try this flavor and see if it's any better than the vanilla one this is a peanut butter cream got that and also they enticed me with these no sugar no nothing Pizza flavored almonds this is either gonna be awesome or awful and I'm not sure which okay so I just open these and they have like just an enormous pizza scent to them see they smell just straight-up like pizza or like pizza seasoning okay those are gone these are absolutely bummed they kind of remind me of like Pizza combos I think if y'all ever had those oh my god they are so good they're so good highly recommend  okay so a quick little update for y'all it's about be 7:30 I call him crew scheduling to get released but they said there's two more flights that are delayed until 7:45 but to give them a call back in a little bit after that I think that's a good sign I think that's a good sign as long as those flights go out crew scheduling gods we're on my side they released to me it is a good day you know it is kind of funny though cuz like I'll sit here sometimes gonna be like I got paid for today this is literally a dream job like sometimes I'm a little dumbfounded that this is a real job moment of appreciation with you all because I'm just fortunate I'm just fortunate I'm really feeling it right now now that we've been released we are obviously sitting outside my husband is out fishing he found the closest pod to here which happens to be like 15 minutes away I'm starving so we gotta get some food no Jack when he came to actually getting out of this my husband literally like picked me up and put me over to the sidewalk doing this at addresses just there's no good way to do it hello hello how was fishing good God breathing's three Biggins three big old bass  I decided uh oh I love coming home to you oho you sweet boy okay so we ended up getting some Wingstop funds a little messy so I got Louisiana rub and also some original hot we're team branch around here and got some jest carrots because celery's disgusting get that out of here my husband likes the bleu cheese I'm not sure why he also likes
