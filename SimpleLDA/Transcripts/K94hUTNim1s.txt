 Hello from the present day I'm here with Adrian Dumb a really quick intro for the vlog you're about to watch cuz it's super long. There's so much footage You know, I really couldn't tell you I've taken me so long to get the soup I don't think we have a full day's worth of footage We just have a lot of footage from a lot of days that were all weeks ago. So yeah, it's taken a while I'm going to vlog sometime this week and like get it up immediately. I Promise. Okay. Sue me. I mean this is this trail mix by yours if I Just wanted pop on say hello. Hope you guys are doing well from the present day Let's see what we have been up to. Good morning How's everyone doing on adda blog say is currently my personal self-quarantine Self quarantine my self quarantine day 4 is wednesday right now suit my skin gear tannish got way too much Facial oil so we got the vegan look ins Some time. We're yeah, not much on the agenda. Things are crazy Like guys what in the world my life hasn't really changed that much in terms of like work I've had like some brand deals and stuff get postponed. Nothing's really got cancelled stuff has just been postponed I need to film video today or tomorrow probably a lot of you guys are actually messaging me asking for tips working from home because a lot of you guys are adjusting to Working for moms. I think I might do on my main channel either Sometimes like work from home Damon life or like tips for working from home or anything. Other than that gonna go email I'm still distracted like nothing They have changed technically for me But I can focusing less than ever like just with everything the way it is like meaning You didn't feel like we're in a time warp every single day like the day flies by I Never know what hour it is cuz it all feels the same and then like I just cannot focus like I don't like I'm normally like Hustling grinding things out and this week. I'm just like, you know back here wanting to watch movies I'll probably try to tackle my email inbox that has a thousand unread emails in it right now It's time to probably do up like every day when I get up I make my bed and this week I have not been because I want to get back in it But one thing I know a lot of people have been talking about picking up hobbies and things like that as a way to entertain Yourself also just as a way to like Rededicate some time to the creative things you like to do and maybe don't always get a chance to so Something I love and used to do all the time is drawing and I have not drawn anything in a good year so what I want to do is draw something in the sketchbook every single day wherever I started so yesterday I drew a little I Pretty satisfied with it I think the eyelashes are better than I normally do because I learned a better tip of how to draw eyelashes from tic toc actually But the eye shapes a little wonky and I know from the beginning and I didn't fix it So I had to change that all some bad eyebrows if anyone has high brow drawing resources, let me know So that's something we're gonna be doing. My Alexa has never done this in the past two days. What? What's the update? What's the news she's been flashing yellow and has never done this before and then yesterday told me that it's time to order dog food Or something. This is the closest to like a real matching outfit I've put on all week I would say I'm wearing little fabletics wet-sand fabletics sports bra It's really helped everyone find something in their life. That brings me as much joy As this avocado toast every single day. Oh Good I eat this every day the law of diminishing marginal utility does not apply It has been the same level of amazing every single day for the past two months. I Truly wish I truly wish everyone just witnessed I was doing like a little happy dance stirring up my coffee and took us bit and I hadn't sweetened it yet That's never happened. I forgot and I my face literally is like a movie I paused and I went come on girl We need you now more than ever. Could you open? All right, I'm now currently getting ready I'm gonna film a video already said, huh? I can't remember anything right? Yeah I've called here in a little bit. I thought I would get ready to video I was like I'm just not gonna do my hair that I was like Morgan you haven't left the house in days Give the people some good hair also seeking advice I don't remember I said this in a vlog but recently so you guys might know I always curl my hair with a straightener That's what I've done for literally years with this one inch straightener that was from a company called flattered and experts That was probably the first thing I was ever sent from a brand and me and a bunch of my youtube friends who have been around for a minute literally all still have that same straightener and like still use it like my friend Casey now every time we travel We both have our little straightener literally eight years ago, and it was amazing it was a great straightener and then I was using it after getting back from the Dominican the first time I turned it on and It worked in the Dominican I used it There was great turned on and I could not explain to you how I had this feeling right when I went to plug it in Where I thought to myself this is going to explode. I know that sounds crazy, but I thought it to myself I don't know why and then I turn it on whatever's heat it up started using it and it started literally a Flame shoots out. It starts like sparking making the lobster smoke is starting to like fly out of this straightener Like I don't know how it was even happening at the rate that it was happening and I like reached it and turned it off Thankfully I could like reach or I guess I'm gonna just unplug it from the wall. Never mind, but I Risked it for you to turn off the thing while it's shooting fire literally Anyways, then just like waited for it to pull down and threw it away So now I don't have a straightener. That one lasted me in the better part of a decade so if anyone has a good one at straightener recommendation Preferably one that can also work to like curl your hair or meaning like I guess the edges aren't anything crazy on it Let me know cuz I'm now in the market and I haven't been able to straighten my hair like at all Also, I really recommend to everyone that you don't watch bird box during this time We were watching a movie every night last time you watch bombshell Then I'm for watched bird box bird box, you know seems a little different than what's going on right now but I think it's not far off just in terms of like people go crazy and then like, you know Starting to like kill each other for supplies and things, okay I will say I am a living for all the celebrity live streams Jojo has been going live every day yesterday Demi and Miley did the little thing together for like an hour and a half That's crazy. Seeing a girl Jojo Go off couch my girl am I coming downstairs to a shoot I already oh Yeah, yeah, you're good Hi smart gasps so smart. Why? Just filmed my main channel bed. Catch me. This is the only time I'm gonna be like, you know looking okay This is probably entire two weeks. So soak it up. Adrienne's been wanting to learn a tik-tok dance for so long We know one from a while ago wasn't our best work But I learned possibly the easiest one ever and now I'm going to just Adrienne so that we can become famous you Can be on that side, you're no longer part. This is our sides now This is the most chaotic So we're working on this we got our work out in a while ago I've already um D sweated a good amount. Also my hair was curly. Haha. What happened to that? Um, we got a good little squad work out. That wasn't my squad at all. It's Adrienne and her friend and her her her gem studio thing they did livestream to work out and I did it like over in our little nook area and then she did it in front of The TV and now I posted my first tik tok So if you would like to follow me my user name is Morgan Elle Yates because I can't ever get the same username on absolutely Anything ever because there are too many Morgan uses. It's ridiculous Anyways, I'll have a link to below if you wanna follow me on tic dog But that's what username I have ideas for tick tock like what do I want to do now? I need a shower and cook some dinner. I am starving. So probably need a little snack right now So glad I took the time to do my hair and makeup today. Okay, everyone who's young and cool? I need advice someone common him said you ate that all caps for the eight part Does that mean good or bad? I'm too old to know what that means Every morning Good morning, it is Monday morning. I'm making breakfast for me and is self-quarantine day nine or ten Tuesday three or four of La being an official lockdown But I just thought I would vlog today give you a little glimpse at a day in my life at these times guys You may have seen on Instagram yesterday as though you know, okay I can get down with we have to be in our house and whatever and like we can Still go for walks you guys let me know because I asked that and my main channel videos Where is that going with this Oh, so Yesterday also don't expect me to look good ever again in vlog yesterday You know, we're at home. We've been home for a long time. Whatever I also have not you know up to this point done a great job at really even getting outside Cuz I think unclear on the rules, but now I'm gonna start going for walks However, it has been raining most of the past week including yesterday, which will be important in a moment yesterday We didn't have any power. Okay. Um, I don't know why everyone's daily asking why I have no idea They did not, you know, we didn't have a meeting and they didn't give me any Reason, so I have no idea our power went off yesterday at like 11:00 a.m And I was like, okay, I just made breakfast my avocado toast that I'm about to make so makin that every single day So what's really gonna timeout when I go to the grocery store is when I'm out of eggs I think I have 12 more so 12 days from now I'm gonna have to be at the grocery store because I can't go a day without eating s you guys I'm an addict but So I made my breakfast. So at least I'm not starving Okay, I don't know what is with where we live but we have these power outages that lasts like a day I would say every Three months or so like we had one over the summer last summer when it was a million degrees You guys might remember I think I've logged or something where we all woke up at like 3:00 a.m Because we were overheating because like the AC and turned top and so we proceeded to like come out we were all just in the living room just Awake all night has been like all day because it was so hot here There was nothing you can do and then I think over like Thanksgiving or Christmas It happened to get here. And now you know, it's our quarterly. It's our q1 power outage Right on time. So immediately my mind is thinking like this is not gonna get turned back on like there's no quick fix It doesn't just come back on in 30 minutes or an hour or whatever like we lose it for a day So the inconvenience of like not having power didn't bother me as much as like this whole time. I haven't been stressed I haven't so much as like had a negative thought like an actual true like negative thought about the situation Adrienne I we're talking about how we both are just very like level throughout all of this even like we have to be here for a Month, I feel like we genuinely will remain as like chill cool as a cucumber We'll see why is it so the sunset? Apparently I am so you've accepted the situation Thankfully our transition into all this was pretty easy since we're used to being home so much anyways but for the first time and only briefly part I actually started getting stressed out by this power outage Yesterday morning because my mind went to like what if this doesn't get turned back on for like a day or more given just like this chaos of everything going on like I thought maybe it'd take even longer to fix the power and My mind is going to like my home all of my fridge like our freezer is full you guys Like I ended up going back Trader Joe since the last vlog and picked up some more things once I realized I was not going to Colombia obviously where I would be right now just to like pick up some More things and when I went back Trader Joe's was dead This is before like the official lockdown, but I went like last Sunday It was the last day. I had been out of the house. I swung why there was no one there They had restocked everything like I waited. I was literally there was no line even to checkout It was like everyone had done it the day before and it was mass chaos And then I caught it the next day and everything was chill so maybe it's like did where he lived and making a big announcement or whatever and it's like your instinct to go rush to the store maybe just give it a day or two because you'll probably be in a better position point being I had enough food like we have so much stuff in this freezer, especially to last us literally for like a Month, I think we was just that long. So my mind is going to like are you kidding me? Like What if all this food goes bad? What if everything in the fridge goes bad and like then we have to go back out to the store Which you might be thinking No big deal Morgan because even in this big lockdown you still can go to the store and that's true however We have been Avoiding ear Jun and I have like well yesterday we closed fainted food because we didn't want to open the fridge or the freezer so as to like Speed up the process of like it not being cold anymore So we posted yesterday, but we have been taking every precaution We have not post mated because we don't want to come in contact with anyone or take anything. Someone is touched We have been leaving our mail outside like our packages and stuff for like a long time And then we like wipe them down and we don't want to go to the grocery store because in my mind that kind of restarts Your whole two weeks of like do I have it or not? Like am I contagious? Whatever because you're coming in contact with people at the grocery store and you're touching things other people have touched so in a perfect world I'm not trying to leave here until I am starving. Also just a side note about post mating It's like hey, I want to support local restaurants and businesses And obviously the way to do that right now is by ordering food to go but B I just feel like that's not safe. Like am I wrong? I just don't know because how many people touched your food and breathed on him and they were making it how many people touched it Like packing it up at the restaurant your postman touched it and count you can wipe down the outside You can't wipe down the food. Like if you're gonna salad you can't wipe down each piece of lettuce So I've been um going back and forth on that yesterday I had a moment where I was a little stressed out because of the power outage thankfully two hours into it So it like 1:00 p.m It came out ager and I were both napping on the couch because we didn't know what else to do I'm still make 30% and I was like sick and just another twist was that it was raining So like we could we wanted to go on a walk or like be outside or do something so that we're not using technology And draining our batteries, but no it was raining. So I have my little freaked out. I didn't have a freakout I just it was the first time it actually felt a little fear an ounce of fear one else will say power came back on For like an hour went back out. So it like - And didn't come back on until like 11 p.m. Last night, which we thought it'd be like all night They were estimating three I missed the return time, but some held a whole second like the long stretch I never freaked out at all. I was very chill during that even about the food I don't know why I was just like it'll be fine. I'll turn in my own fur goes bad, huh? Hopefully and my vows eggs that have been in the non cold fridge for however long as I go straight Yeah, but I don't know what temperature got down to I'm no scientist So yesterday was all around an adventure, especially if it got dark we lit Approximately actually know exactly 17 candles that we had combined. I think 15 were mine I will never shave myself again for buying a candle every time I go in target because you never know when you're gonna need it For a power outage and it was super cozy in here aside from the overwhelming scent That was like starting to give me a headache and it started getting kind of hot But then we found these like emergency lantern things that we both had my dad he'd definitely give me that and mine is you know, it was like 17 candles times four. It was so bright. So then we blow out candles and sat around doing nothing You're playing guess who it was an adventure. I'm very glad the powers back on I would take a month of being self quarantine, which is what we're doing anyways So that's great Oh from a week of being here with no power. Yeah This would be the worst time for the big earthquake did it? It's all I'm gonna say I may not make my breakfast I'm starving I will be getting ready at some point actually though in this video Because I'm gonna film today. I need to film a haul video Alright just plan out some things for this week sitting here sipping my coffee The leftover beer of Adrian's last night. Don't worry. We're not starting that early just because it's quarantine Can I respond to a couple emails now that I plan my week? I'm feeling good this week We're gonna be on our grind if you guys want a good workout its boxing ish It's like half boxing you don't need any kind of equipment You're literally just punching the air. Although I probably gonna hold like three pound weights or something So it feels like some resistance. It's mixed was just like body weight little interval things. She switches to up every 30 seconds So you're not ever repeating anything the whole workout and her Instagram is witty snacks She's my favorite rumble instructor if they'll go show her some support if you also need some at home workouts Cuz she out of work right now. They all are it's very sad so for real go check it out if you want to update I Just literally two hours learning and take out dance and filming 18,000 takes of it and I still couldn't get one that I was perfectly happy with but I Posted the little dance it's over on Tik Tok This is taking over my life. Oh, wait, I probably can't give a preview the audio. I'm gonna get copyrighted All right, I'm gonna get copyrighted baby. Go check it out. I'm gonna do this workout for real now Let's see how long it takes Once I gonna go, you know I was really like I was about to start working out and the next I found myself at the fridge eating raw cookie dough out Of a container things can take a turn so quickly. Alright, we're gonna see how long it takes me to figure out how to Cast this livestream could figure it out I'm not How's everyone doing it's been a minute Day, it's still dinnertime earlier. I finally shower and life is getting away from me. I think I'm going crazy I now have pulled out most of the fresh things in my fridge and I'm about to wing a dinner No idea what I'm making ass It's just like vegetables cutting up a sweet potato that I'm gonna roast with some spicy seasonings I have kale potatoes Brussels sprouts a red pepper and some quinoa So I don't know what of this I want to make right now These are really about to go bad that is already cut up So it seems to making that just some soup potato kale Brussels. This is starting to get a little wrinkly Hmm actually oricon. I bought a couple of Trader Joe's soy chorizo things That would make a lot more sense to save that and then eat this other stuff together I feel like such a suburban mom right now Watching now wheel of fortune while I cook drinking a glass of wine that has a wine stopper this just is what really does it for me that says joy tell me that's not Suburban mom if you guys can't get wine at your grocery store, maybe it's a good time to look into week I haven't ordered off there and forever, but I still have a bunch stocked over on our bar cart So I thought what better time than to drink alone. I'll my referral link below I don't even remember the deal but I think you get a bottle or two free or something if you're interested. All right Got a huge mess going thinking do I want to meet toss these in like some? Balsamic and honey, and like maybe a little lemon squeeze I have lemons as well I think when I go big and make these honey balsamic, I have no system produces. You can hear if you're working out I'm gonna go in white and then see what I want to Hmm Whoa, I'm chef Adrienne Dinner served lots of veggies goodness going on put some humus in here and I'm gonna just stir this around that way. There's actually like Something holding everything together. You know what I mean? Turn it all up now. This is so flavorful Anything you cooked nikki is in the seasonings these sweet potatoes. I load it up with a bunch Well a bunch of stuff but key ingredient was some cayenne pepper and she spicy right now. Okay, so this is cooling it down So good And I'm back did I film announcer oh no, this is the odd-job. Thanks for watching. Bye
