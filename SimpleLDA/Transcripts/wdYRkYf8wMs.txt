 g-class transcription so guys this is the four weeks of the guarantee the situation is getting out of control lots of deaths lots of confirmed cases and the main question remains is how the small business medium-sized enterprises are going to cope with that because the stimulus checks will eventually run out the unemployment benefits will deplete what are you going to do next after this so my advice is to look at the telecommuting options this is something I've been doing for many many many years when it started with my firm back in 2002 because of the nature of the industry we employed a lot of linguists people working from home it's not efficient to find people locally to work in the office because of the nature of the work today you might have some document to translate to Japanese tomorrow could be Russian or could be French so and until the gaps between the the projects and you cannot constantly take in and out translators so we implemented the work from home model from from day one for us it's no reason but no difference as long as we have the projects as long as if people are still spending money on localization we can we can help them in the way we could before so the problem is now all the stores are closed parks are closed hospitals are overloaded people are sick at home at the hospital and people are telecommuting they're trying to do some work while children are at their home it's a logistical nightmare when we weren't prepared to do this we weren't prepared to work from home even though some people already did but the biggest hurdle is to of course to discipline children and make sure they can study and be effective s as usual as a business I think you should think in terms of expanding globally this is the time when you can have free resources freed people from doing the jobs which they would normally be doing in hospitality in construction in travel and now you can put on more resources into towards the digital businesses trying to localize your website as you can when I tried to I was since I live in America always tries to I always thought that English is the dominant language in the world and once you have your website only in English you you have access to all the possible no customers out there this is was a flawed assumption most customers I begin to realize speak non English language could be German the largest economy in the Europe is the Chinese it could be Japanese biggest manufacturer of of cars so on and so on and these people do not understand English and they do not conduct business in US dollars there are multiple currencies out there and if you are going to go global you have to accommodate not just of the language but also the shopping cart and the currency your customers are going to be shopping at so the biggest challenge now is to find those resources find those teams who can translate your work website translate your business process make sure you can receive orders in foreign currencies from foreign customers and you can deliver them the goods or services over the Internet this is the the biggest right now survival ship model I can think of if your local store is going to close what else you going to do because you have no customers so think about the expansion multilingual this is the handsome second thing is is the fun interpretation since now the borders are closed you cannot take the flight and visit China or any other trade shows they still need to conduct businesses business and aside from sending cold emails in English you can also do face-to-face meetings with the potential clients over Skype or whatsapp or any other messenger you're using and when you interact with a foreigner in a foreign language you need an assistant to interpret your conversation and do it very cost-effectively in the old way there was in the old way there was a very expensive price structure which charge a lot of money for customers order stuff charging a lot of customer a lot of money per per minutes for the customers and it wasn't that feasible to to use the photo interpretation anywhere other than just healthcare or legal fields but now with the invention of some tools such as a Cunha which can do full interpretations of machine-assisted phone interpretation for as long as 29 cents per minute this is a game-changer it's 10 times less than any other competitive solution on the market and it allows to get 90% of the spoken spoken speech translated so your message will get across and this is a very effective way to do that so these tools are becoming increasingly more popular vocalization for interpretation there could be video chats there could be some tools to expand the online learning especially for kids which which cannot cannot read yet for example if you have a five six-year-old child he or she doesn't really have how are you going to explain how are you going to explain them how to interact with computer when they don't know what computer is it's a line learning is effective for for adults for college students to know what the keyboard is would go the basics like how open the word processor works of an email works are small kids don't understand that and the current tools such as Google classroom or anything like it they are no good they're not effective they're just bringing a lot of burden on the parents the parents have to do twice more work they have to do emailing they have to do reading they have to do submitting the homework printed out materials and policing kids before doing the work so there's a lot of room for a lot of room an opportunity for business people to actually jump on and make this pandemic an effective way of living for lots of lots of households there are households different in size in money in socioeconomic status so there are lots of lots of segmentation process going on and and one fits all model that will currently have with the online software it doesn't do a good job so this is one of the opportunities you could be jumping on it and trying to fix so localization website translation phone interpretation these are the things you should be really paying attention to right now and use this downturn to expand your your plug in your website your software into as many languages as possible and once this pandemic is over you can jump and become a leading supplier all right
