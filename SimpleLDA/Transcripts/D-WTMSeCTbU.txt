 everyone looks here as I said in the title just wanted to update you all on a couple of things some of you might have noticed that this is the first time you've seen my face in about a month I started doing face intros about a year ago to try to get back into the YouTube Partner Program and it worked and it was fun to be able to add that extra level of connection but I also found that the intros were killing my audience retention so for now I've decided to dish the intros and just do vlogs like this you know once a month probably less just to show YouTube that it is still me running the channel it's been pretty quiet around here lately you know for obvious reasons so don't have any new fire responses what I will be doing is digging into the archives of my computer and posting some older nonresponse videos just you all have something to watch while you're sheltering in place you all are sheltering in place right we are of course living in strange scary times right now those of us in Seattle have been dealing with it for the last couple weeks those of you not in Seattle are probably having to deal with it now like a lot of other people I am currently out of work thanks to Co vid and not sure when or if my job will be coming back thankfully I have some savings that I can live off of for a few months Amazon and a lot of the local grocery stores are hiring right now and I first retail before and didn't mind it but the thought of being exposed to the public in a retail environment right now kind of freaks me out so I'm just kind of playing it for ear playing it by ear and see how that goes of course I'm also worried about my folks who are older and I have family in New York City which is pretty scary right now Seattle is doing pretty well with the social distancing with some notable exceptions we went to Golden Gardens last Wednesday thinking it might be quieter but it was insanely busy we nope out of there and went somewhere much less crowded this week they closed the parking lot to Golden Gardens and a handful of other parks so that should help lower the number of people they also close the West Seattle bridge for supposedly unrelated reasons and that will also limit the number of people being able to go to Alki Beach around Ballard here foot traffic is noticeably lighter a lot of businesses are closed I took a walk down and around Ballard Avenue today and most of the shops are closed and quite a few were also boarded up we unfortunately have a high population of transients and junkies and they've already been reports of increased break-ins this week thankfully the most important businesses are still open including Starbucks the marijuana dispensaries and the grocery stores well close this out by saying please take this fire seriously that's affecting a lot of people including young otherwise healthy people don't go out unless you need to you know walking for exercise is okay but keep away from other people as much as possible wash your damn hands and take care of yourself this is a really stressful time and it's normal to be scared or anxious it's okay to take a break from the news and watch cute puppy videos instead I was having some issues last week where it felt like I was having trouble breathing and I figured it was just due to anxiety but to make sure I bought what's called a pulse oximeter this was like 35 bucks that he can probably them cheaper and it just goes onto your finger and you push a button and then it tells you what your blood oxygen level right is so that way you know I was feeling in the house having trouble breathing but then my oxygen rate was still 100% so I knew then it was just my anxiety it was not my lungs so yeah take care of yourselves take care of each other from a distance and we will all get through this we will get to the other side of it the sphere that we kind of self isolate this year we can slow down the spread of the virus and the senior life goes back to normal and hopefully you know by this summer we can all be hanging out in front of the fire stations again waiting to get good responses so this is Lucas otherwise thanks for watching and hope you enjoy hey everybody Lukas here this is a test of the laptop webcam recording system makes my face look weird which is not ideal so I need a haircut you
