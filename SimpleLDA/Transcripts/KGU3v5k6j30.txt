 oh hey what's up I am here in my humble abode getting ready to film me a little bit of a vlog because there are some things I can do even though you know it's a quarantine vlog I'm sure you've seen a hundred of these already I would flip the camera around well flip the camera around let's get flip flip it there it is oh look at who it is Oh what are you doing just working Oh tight look at you fish tank window I thought this guy was a fish the cat likes to sit at the window meow rabbit alright cool well swift transition you ready Oh  so guys you know if I would be going out gonna make sure I'm staying safe and keep them gloves on deck I had him on when I left but you know for the sake of of all I think it'd make sense if I put them on now while I ear this bad boy yeah this is hat for the workout so uh yeah I got a little chance to get out and get some air I felt like I might shoot a little blog about it I think even though there's a lot of things we can't do but still stuff we can do just think about it and try to figure out a way to make it work and stay safe so that's what I'm trying to do today that's the whole point of this so I guess you know we're about to get ready I just gotta all right how do I look oh my god I hope the editor doesn't make me look like an idiot no real need to make you look like an idiot you're doing a good enough job at that on your own back to the look  other people suffer from like anxiety stress depression and right now it's not a real good time for people like that I myself being one of them but what you can try to do is just chill and realize that being alone isn't so bad for right now and when things are over you'll be able to go back out also keep in mind that if you've got introverted friends they're probably doing just fine give them a call anyway though to make sure that they're doing good and if you do find yourself stuck in moments where you don't have anything to do in your board being boards pretty good cuz it means maybe at the moment you don't have anything to worry about so just kind of take it you know day by day look I'm no expert in the subjects I'm just trying to help out that's all so you know sitting and being alone and contemplating that's not a bad thing at all  oh you know I never really been that good at track stands but I thought a little bit of free time on my hands might as well practice so I just want to talk about what you can do you can sit outside and read you can sit inside and read you can exercise you can workout you can even go outside for a little walk take your dogs out hang out with your kids I guess I don't know just don't focus on what you can't do and try to focus on the things that you can do and right now at least I can come out and ride my bike a little bit which is nice the weather's kind of trash but it still feels good to kind of have a little bit of the old life so whatever you feel like you got to do is just try to do it stay safe keep them hands clean  we're going back on I think we're probably gonna head back to the house  I usually don't ride my bike like a bleedin but it's not really anybody on the street so kind of feels like the only opportunity I would get to ride like this
