 says grocery pickup order update they substituted five items although 13 items out of stock y'all 13 I just woke up I'm lying good morning today is day three I'm exhausted because I am a lactose-intolerant lord of mercy this is how we're starting this vlog today apparently so is Jude every time we have pizza I don't know why we keep doing this to ourselves I'm hoping the weather is nice I'm actually gonna take some would like a slap of wood and put it underneath my mattress today because I don't know if it's the frame or the single slats that I got from Ikea almost like my bed is starting to bow it's been like that for a while but I really didn't notice it so I'm gonna do that today I want to edit a hall edit yesterday's vlog and get that up to you guys oh my gosh the response on the vlog day one is so good so it's very motivating that's why it's really important for you guys to like comment and share I've seen it youtubers will have million-plus subscribers and their views are low low low low low so we're all affected by this mm-hmm the weather doesn't look too bad outside so I think I'm gonna take my dogs on a morning walk and get out have some fresh air yeah I better get up Oh bless you  she's old this is what happens when you try to film and walk your dog oh my baby making lunches the next month again I'll have room for another dump in here it's so cold out here it literally feels like it's snowing and I feel like I already complained about that already we need to get it walks in okay so we're gonna take about thirty minute walk and Jude should be waking up soon too he had a really late night - or was avenge the via Domino's so when I say live with mountains I literally live by the rounds guys hi oh brother oh brother nice to see you guys come on Beast all come on there's some mattresses too because we just switched ours out but here's the what I was talking about Oh okay so I put my bed back together that was filed Jude is still sleeping and I'm hungry I wanted cereal and the only Sara had is this one here this is from Trader Joe's it's gluten frequent granola and that was the most bootleg thing I've ever done probably not ever done that's a dramatical teammate cuz I'm pretty bootleg okay I'm from Azusa we're very resourceful but I ordered a new frame so you guys will see that on Sunday if it doesn't come earlier than that because Amazon surprises me sometimes I need to get a rug for underneath here too it's just I live by the canyon base which already said I get so much dirt and dust up in here I'm constantly having a mop and sweep that rugs get destroyed I mean hello Jude has asthma so I can't run the heater as much as I want because if I do the air gets dry and I have to run humidifiers in the rooms that he's hanging out in I have to be like pretty conservative about that kind of thing I just changed the air filter make sure you guys do that supposed to be changed every three I think there were three three months girl no freaking know about this my filter was so gross crusty dusty might as well have had like a trapped demon inside of one of the little folds I didn't know about this until I researched about our allergies and one of the number one things is to change the air filter so it's like a huge air filter in like the wall would you keep asking me for underwear every time he takes a shower because I have been putting off doing laundry right here and I have to wash clothes too it's almost 10 o'clock in Jude still asleep I mean he woke up in the middle of the nineties restroom woke up at 5:00 this morning to use the restroom so it's pretty pooped pun intended so this is our wall cabinet here in the hallway so if you open it up this looks like a dungeon cuz this machine is probably like 5,000 years old I feel like I'm leprechauns gonna jump out and get me dang it's dark as heck hold on that help of kinda that looks like it's scary dirty but it's not it's just darker wood in here filters you just have to make sure that you get the right size so it's nice and I'm filming this like a day delayed because I have to edit you guys will see how long hulls could sit I'm just sitting here I'm watching um standard foot rolls I'm cracking up because lambs bath is like the officiant for their wedding and I would have died a little secret is I used to be a huge bachelor boy in insane town I know my mom is watching this video mind your business in the comments because the church is gonna be like huge you mean like psycho you know what very passionate a loyal follower it's just gonna happen to change my name on my work at school totally fine perfectly normal I also went to their concerts like crazy person me and my best friend at the time we went to go see the Backstreet Boys my mom's the best she paid for those tickets even though we didn't have much money growing so she's the best what let's do Buffy oh good morning buddy man Jude do you know that it's ten o'clock what I just got an alert through Walmart I just know it's gonna be a bad one so put my hair up and down all day due to anxiety so excuse that says grocery pickup order update they substituted five items they substituted my yeast for baking soda the same thing also 13 items out of stock y'all thirteen unbelievable including apples which I was so looking forward to eating salad potatoes romaine lettuce hearts lemon meat toilet paper sparkling water I wonder how much how much I'm actually getting the last four orders at a place with Walmart in the last week more than 50% of my order has been out of stock now before that with my weekly pickup orders maybe one item was out of stock but for the most part sort of substitutions were on point I mean I couldn't even make a meal with what I was able to get please let me know let us all know because people are going to be reading the comments too cuz I see a lot of you guys responding to each other which is great what stores you have been picking up from and if you've experiencing the same things or is it just Walmart the order I'm picking up today actually placed it a week ago because I had a feeling that this was gonna happen so luckily for me I was able to reserve my spot and throughout that week's time I was adding things to my cart no lean damn well that a lot of things were going out of stock we're even having a different relationship with our toilet paper and that weird good cookies okay so I'm at Walt I'm at MoMA I'm at Target right now god drive like this now yeah  okay so this is also what I was missing for my Walmart order which I have been I got it what I was working too so anyways I want to make sure that I don't hate there's no way of them substituting you couldn't just get whatever you want I'm a cheater now I don't get to spend anymore but I just wanted this tropical cherry don't forget to take your prescriptions y'all I'm not sure if we went down all the way so I just fed Jude he got chocolate chip waffle some sausage links and the other half of this banana so I'm going to eat this half of banana I'm going to pick up my Walmart order the parking lot is hacked over here this one's not even the one close to my house it's a ways from my house but this is the only Walmart that had slots that were available no it feels kind of weird out here maybe because I know what's going on in the world that it makes me feel like uneasy but life goes on y'all even the lady was like sorry she just said that the store was empty like I know I get it it's no reason to give her a hard time and I hope you guys remember when you go out and get your stuff to be flexible because I wouldn't want to be doing her job okay so god bless her and the whole Walmart team and everybody else that does pick up because it's got to be just as frustrating if not scary for them to have to deal with the crazy people like us you know what I mean I was talking to my friend who is a mom she's got a few kids and she's experiencing the same anxiety that I've been feeling where I haven't been eating much and I think in our subconscious mind we are worried that we're gonna run out of food even though we're not like we have plenty of food but our in our minds are like our children can eat that I shouldn't eat that so I definitely have been feeling very fatigued because of the lack of nutrition so I'm gonna be more mindful about that Jude if you're gonna run the heater you need to put on the humidifier if you're going to run the heater you need to put on the humidifier or put some clothes on one of the things that I really need to do also is get in the habit of getting dressed in the morning even though I'm here at home me looking like this does not help my mood when I see myself in the mirror if that makes any sense so I want to look better so I can feel better I feel like a big chunk of the day wasn't filmed today because I was screwing to book a flight for my brother-in-law his mom is not doing very good and he needs to fly there now and possibly bring her back this is like another thing like that's scary because of all the precautions and screenings and testings and things like that that you have to go through she might not even get approved so the five hundred plus dollars he's spending to go there grab his mom and come back it's probably going to be too waste because they probably will deny her so I'm hoping to god we're gonna get some good news about that update on my vlog status our monetization status both of them were approved so my ads are running which is great I don't flood with ads I hope there's like not too many interruptions there shouldn't be I don't add any extra ones than YouTube suggests in places for me I mean I could there's a lot of youtubers who do that and I completely understand why they do that but I'm not going to do that to you guys and so grateful for all of you who are posting on social media and tagging me because it means so much it makes me feel like like I am reaching people and you guys are enjoying it and I have the purpose so now I'm gonna go sit down and watch a movie and relax because it's been a tense few days I need to chill chill and to help is a real one guys another thing that's been pretty challenging is getting my son to be physical when he thinks it's like they're on vacation not on vacation so make sure you guys check the description for like a mock schedule and you guys can alter it to your lifestyle and what's going on with your kids I just put you to bed and I'm about to read boundaries with kids until I go to sleep I'm just setting to do that instead of being on social media because I really need a chill down moment before I am going to rest I don't know how my bootleg bed situation is gonna go on but I'm excited for Sunday because that's when my new frame comes and I'll be legit again but until then I'm gonna brush my teeth and go to sleep
