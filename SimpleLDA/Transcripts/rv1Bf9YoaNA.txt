 okay good morning everyone world welcome to another vlog so today is Sunday I have a few things on my to-do list today and I figured I would take you guys along weekend day and Quarantine so it's about 10:00 a.m. right now because at about 6:00 a.m. I woke up with a migraine took a sumatriptan it kicked in thankfully so I need to pluck my eyebrows because they are looking a little bit too Chewbacca for my liking I shaved last night I need to do my hair today and I just wanted to let you guys know at the beginning that a portion of today's vlog is sponsored by Brio Gio I am so excited to tell you about this new oil that we will talk about later on you know tomorrow's Monday so tomorrow I'm gonna be filming a sit-down beauty video and everything and I might try and film another IG TV I've been trying to like pop out the IG TV content lately just got to get everything in order here because whoa cut plant fully dead I need to trust that I put on my workout clothes because I'm gonna try and go on a walk but I'm actually gonna get in my car drive to a different neighborhood and then like going to walk because where I live it's pretty busy outside like there's just so many people walking and I just don't want to risk it I'm just gonna find like a really empty neighborhood so I'm gonna go and walk in a few minutes but first let's make of it nice taffy time I actually haven't tried this oat milk yet but these two are what I always do this is the best iced coffee ever it's just the unsweetened medium rose Starbucks this one tastes like the most mild to me I've tried other iced coffee things I have like the Jabalia one or whatever and I like black coffee this just doesn't have like the bitter taste and then this open up I haven't actually tried it I usually like the things the planet oat milk the extra creamy I just want to try this one I've tried a few others but I just want to confirm with myself that the planet one is the best and then okay I know what you're thinking that looks like holiday packaging it is holiday packaging this stuff is still good I think it's a total myth that creamer expires like don't get me wrong I've definitely had some expired creamer but the expiration dates that they put on these are so not true like you can use the creamer past the date and it still smells tastes totally fine I'm sure they just want to sell more and they make these like big bottles to the Trader Joe's let me Edition 1 was the best I actually have a few of those in the freezer at my boyfriend's place but this is the best iced coffee combo so let's shake this up by the way this cleaner miss Myers not you know it does not bleach it or anything so I've still been bleaching but this I'll just put over top just to kind of like be a second clean but also it just smells really good it's the peppermint I think this is also yeah it was also a limitation seasonal I was going through this guy first this is the pine one so I just added a little bit of water just to finish that off whatever is left but obviously I'm still sanitizing with bleach first where was I going with that oh I just sprayed this all over the counter so it smells really good but this isn't concentrated so it's just like normal you know like coffee just cold so you can do as much as you want but usually I'll pour like this is my second cup of coffee today so I'm not doing like the full clip if I was only having iced coffee I would probably fill it up like 3/4 of white and then let's try this open hopefully it's good I also a scream right now that I'm obsessed with it's this one oh my god this is so good it basically just tastes like really creamy ice cream I'm not into almond milk I hate the taste of almond in soy milk but oat milk and coconut milk I like for the most part but the coconut milk is really dependent on the brand for me not all are created equal ok so I usually put about that much in like I said I haven't tried this one so I don't know how cream it is so I might need to add more and then for creamer I don't like it super sweet I just like it a little bit so I just maybe like that much let's taste this I think I need a little bit more creamer tiny bits Witcher hmm okay good yeah that's just what needed one cup has eighty calories silk I think makes also a lower calorie oat milk I feel like it's in like a blue carton I don't know but instacart only had this one left speaking of coffee I figured I would finally kind of show you guys my mug collection over here I do have some in my cabinet too but you guys always ask about this and I've never actually shown like oh my mugs I don't think but this rack was from Amazon link it down below this one I've got me well from Target this was like recent I think it's over the holidays or Thanksgiving I have a little obsession with lighthouses so I am this at Goodwill I think this one was also a goodwill fund this one was from my merch collection it's not in stock right now and also because of everything the merch is not available right now because it's obviously shipping facilities and stuff aren't ripping out and then this was from the the hostess from Amazon actually I think it's like the Starbucks dupe though it looks like the Starbucks roastery cup I just really liked how like sleek this one was and then this I found at t.j.maxx this H gave me yep very about Michaels I think this one was from the thrift store a thrift store Starbucks obviously this is Starbucks Seattle mud star missus based in Seattle if you guys didn't know like the headquarters are here and also the first Starbucks store ever since the idol what is this oh no this one's my bitchin mug I should flip that this was from skinny-dip London but I don't recommend them I've had issues with their site and ordering from them this was from Etsy but they don't make it anymore I'm pretty sure and then this one my boyfriend got me for Christmas this year can you tell there's a there's a theme happening boyfriend different yeah I love to party if we couldn't do this one is from a antique shop in a random town in Washington like on the way from Seattle to Spokane I want to start collecting donut shop mugs I have this donut one this one I think was from TJ Maxx and then Smith Tower but I actually got the SEC goodwill in Seattle Smith towers like the observatory really cool place in Seattle if you're visiting go to Smith Tower super cool it used to be the tallest building and see I only have like a bar at the top and like a little observatory deck and stuff it's really cool so that's my mug collection very exciting things have like a couple more mugs in here that just don't fit on the Shelf of stuff but I need to I need to add another rack in here because I just have some like hello fresh menus that I love with their menus recipes I still like to make this needs to be reorganized but I need more shelf so I need to like add another one in here so I can layer them these are my favorite tweezers they're just the hoodie beady little like kiss ones I don't know what they're called I have one square of toilet paper because this is a hot commodity right now normally when I pluck a like wrap the hairs off with toilet paper you know also my nails need to be done maybe we'll do that later I heard grows so fast I literally put my eyebrows like five days ago so I have some form thoughts on dip powder now that I have it removed my nails are so freakin weak I don't think they've ever been this week I've had like four break off by not even doing anything just like living life consensus on dip powder I love how it looks your nails feel super strong when you have it on because it's like an extra hard coat on your nails is basically acrylic but to get it off they freaking drill down your nails so my nails have literally never been this thin or this week so I don't know it's like kind of the thing with gel and dip and all nail things it seems like is that if you keep doing it it's fine but as soon as you want to remove it then you have to like build your nails back up to being strong again so I still love the way that it looks I think I would get it done again but I'm just knowing that it destroys your nails and I guess it depends on how they remove it it would definitely help if you just have them soak it off you're just gonna be there for like an hour and a half to get your nails off but whoever says powder makes your nails stronger that's a load of bull crap okay so quarantine hasn't been that much different for me because it's basically what I do normally I work from home thankfully and I'm used to being stuck in the house when I don't want to be because of health stuff so I'm kind of used to like feeling trapped a little bit I think it's all about your attitude it about the quarantine aspect you know always sneeze when I pluck my eyebrows anyone else I wonder what that is like why does that trigger sneezing I'm not dismissing anything going on I made a whole video about my thoughts on that topic if you want to watch that link in the item down below I'm just gonna have a good chill a little bit productive day tomorrow's Monday like I said so I need to edit a couple thumbnails like Mondays and Wednesdays and schedule Monday's video today so mean blonde little hairs oh I didn't even use my square now I feel like I need to do so it wasn't a waste my brows are booked I just put on my super goop glowy SPF even though obviously no one's probably gonna see me and I'm just going on a walk I just wanted to put a little bit of makeup up I have my big foam board here that's like blocking all of the light coming from the window I've been liking this Hayley's reinvent BB drops tinted marula face oil have a shade fair cool it's basically when you come in here yeah how is it such a pretty finish it's basically I mean it's exactly this it's like a tinted oil and it just gives you this glowy sheer coverage so I like using it when I'm only doing something like this where I just want a little bit of coverage I'm looking really is like dark and orange on here but it's just because of light so I literally just drop a little bit of this on my face I'm going to use show use today let's try it with the Sigma f80 - I haven't tried it with the round kabuki it it's a really nice shade for me - I'm just gonna like evens out everything but still makes it look like you literally have nothing on like it looks exactly the same as before put it on as far as the finish it's very natural-looking I've worn it with like more fill up more intense eyes - it's got way too much on my forehead I'm just gonna blend that down here - and it looks nice there - you can build it up as you can see let's say you can get it to medium coverage like light medium coverage but I prefer to just use a tiny bit and wear it more sheer like I did on this side and then on my forehead I do have to go over it with a sponge just right here to kind of like press it into the skin I take a little bit of this Becca under-eye brightening concealer like a touch just to brighten up my darkness but I don't really want to fully concealed and I'm not gonna set it with powder so I'm just gonna use it right towards my inner corner practice a touch of highlight and glow I'm gonna use the fresh watch startled this is so pretty I've talked about this before but just very natural it's a cream so I like using it when I'm doing this kind of makeup okay there we go I'm just gonna add a touch of my covergirl easy-breezy brow in deep fear quick deep fears I already have the lineage lip sleeping mask and vanilla I'm a woman mesh I always say round one edge so still looks like skin just a little bit to feel more put together you know mm cut walk essentials right now it's actually kind of sunny out so I have on my Anita's peach hat looks kind of weird with this do I can I feel like but whatever literally Mel's gonna save me I have my Amazon err pause oops I talked about this in one of my past logs and you guys these are awesome basically the exact same as err pause it's just like a third of the price so I like these down below I haven't had any issues with them some of their VSA people have so I don't know but mines have been totally fine and then I got my hand sanitizer thank God I got a few of these when we were in New York because they're really gone  go get it  okay so I just got back from my walk that was actually so nice it was like a walk slash drive even trying to find a calm neighborhood right now it's like not super possible in Seattle or still people and we were just like avoiding each other like crossing the street and stuff and then I just kind of went on a drive just to like find a cool view and chill in my car for a little bit so now I just really need to shower it and wash my hair I haven't washed my hair in maybe like five days 1:50 here right now so it's definitely in need of a wash but I wanted to thank Biagio for continuing to support my channel and sponsoring a portion of today's video I have been using these bad boys as my new bottle I just showed these in the empties video but I just used up both of these so these ones are new but this is the Brio Gio be kind be gentle banana and coconut superfood shampoo and conditioner I've talked about these for as long as I've been using him I think about a year now maybe my hair has grown so much I don't have any extensions in or anything this is all my real hair these guys make my hair feel so healthy and soft and it smells like happiness which is what we all need right now you know it smells like summer it just smells very I mean it's super banana E so if you don't like bananas you wouldn't like the set to this but it smells amazing in my opinion and there's no parabens sulfates these are cruelty free and vegan these ones have fruit vegetable fatty acids so they're just very nourishing with your hair you color my hair doesn't make my color fade or anything since they are sulfate free because I don't wash my hair super frequently as it is I almost always shampoo my hair twice and I love how this lathers and then this is just like a super thick moisturizing feeling conditioner and it just works these just work really well in my hair talked about I'm done so let's hop in the shower I'm gonna keep playing my podcast right now I'm listening to Nick Viall podcast quality content it's an interview with hey man anyone else obsessed with The Bachelor I think since I'm feeling pretty good right now I'm actually gonna maybe share something I do to be today so I think I am gonna wash and style my hair too  clean up there  I can't explain how happy beep take me a bit of sunshine we have today is making me bin cloudy and rainy for like the last 5 days and it's supposed to be like that for the next five days or a week so I'm just like trying to stand in this room and soak up the Sun but my hair is just drying I like to let it dry in a towel as long as possible maybe like a half hour so if I'm styling it in the same day which I am today and so I'm gonna just make some thumbnails and get some computer work done right now well this is a mood okay okay I'm just shook it up so you can see but this is down to about here now mom I said this is one of my favorite products ever this is the BRE rgo color protect primer so so good smells amazing just got that all over this one I feel really helped control my frizz and it just makes my hair so shiny and smell amazing and it's also like a just leave in kind of conditioner thing that's why I use it brush it yeah I'm just gonna quickly blow-dry my hair and then I'll show you guys what I do to style it okay I have a lot of hair so this is what my hair looks like once it's blow-dried and can see how long it is once it's like straight now actually goes like almost down to my hips I just got a haircut to like two months ago maybe a month and a half ago time to curl this is the t3 and I've showed this five billion times so I'm just gonna do this real quick doing this takes me and I know 15 minutes for my whole head sometimes less one side down so my hair is curled and as you can see it looks like a little bit tight so I'm just gonna kind of like comb through with my fingers a little bit and this just kind of like gives it a bit more body by the way I did spray in my fruit spray already just to cover up my roots it just gives you that leg thing kind of lose her waves okay so this is just with that keep protected and I haven't put anything else in yet so as a strengthening treatment and like finishing oil basically I'm going to use this new product from Rio Gio which is there don't despair repair strengthing treatment oil I've been using this for about a month and a half I've been testing it I want to say maybe even two months I only do videos if I test the product and actually want to talk about it and like it just so you guys know I have great spray still in my hand look at how beautiful this is with like the flower inside it looks like I haven't even touch this but I have you just need literally one or two drops of this I have longer thicker hair dye use like two to three but if you have thinner hair you definitely need like a drop or two of this has a controlled drop around here which is awesome as you can see it literally just drops out tiny drops you're not going to get like too much oil so the amazing thing about this oil that I'm obsessed with is that you can put it on dry hair like I use it every morning not just after I style my hair even if I'm not doing anything that day just to like strengthen my hair and serve as like a treatment because it is extremely lightweight it's like a very it's not a dry oil but it's very lightweight so I think if you have fine hair if you used a drop of this I really don't think it would make your hair too oily which I know is a lot of people's concerns with hair oils if you have like finer thin hair because it is such a lightweight oil you could use it morning and night I've been using it either after I style my hair like today and make sure you bring it down all the way to the ends because this does really help with split ends or I'll just put it on like I said in the morning as like a treatment and it doesn't weigh my hair down doesn't make me a Lee at all so here's my hair very shiny and the stuff by the way smells freaking amazing it almost smells like I'm gonna show you the perfume I think it smells like it smells heavenly it's more of a like floral spring kind of scent and look at my end you guys it has ceramides that are gonna help strengthen the hair macadamia nut derivative and rose flower oil this is available on support calm which is awesome so andr leave the link down below to the strengthening treatment oil and the other three oshio products i use today and it's time for burrito this is the highly professional microwave edition excusing my refried beans don't get my cheese the essentials i do this fully in the microwave key is putting it off center so that when you roll it there's enough space you know this is what 27 years on the planet has talking oh even have sour cream kill yeah you have to first microwave the beans and then only do the tortilla with the cheese for like maybe 20 seconds and then you put the warm beans in it's all set up whoo he is not feeling too good folks it's my big honor that was some good in there how appetizing does that look here's where the magic happens people sides in hold it and roll well I've been prepping my whole life to give you guys a burrito YouTube tutorial I've been having kombucha out the wazoo lately I try and drink like half a bottle a day just cuz it has good probiotics and everything and good for immune system and I've also been taking immunity like ginger shots and stuff really like this flavor I also have one from things called kombucha doctor or something like that that's like ginger lemon I really like the ginger lemon one too but this one's kind of more sweet so I found these cars on Amazon and by the way anytime I'm ordering anything from Amazon I'm like saving everything in my cart until I have multiple things and then I'll just select ship like all at once or whatever be just to minimize because obviously the delivery system right now with Amazon is just totally overwhelmed so just to make sure that people get their essentials first and like minimize orders and boxes and everything I'm just doing that so says conversation starters by create relationships basically they're like cards and random questions that you can ask each other and we are currently in quarantine from each other in isolation so just when we FaceTime and stuff I thought these would be fun to like ask each other let's see some of these what do you love about your hometown what do you buy what are you bored of hmm that's hard one but did you want to be when you were 10 years old I feel like so far we've done at least what three objects that you own do you value the most what's good one okay I'm excited I love this kind of stuff this is why i like watching married at first sight together because it's basically like therapy it's like a sexologist therapist and then they have like a spiritual advisor and they have the couples do this session called like fishbowl questions and so I always like posit and then we'll do it so I love this kind of stuff it's Rachel's birthday Rachel my best friend and obviously we're in quarantine so I can't celebrate but I wanna make for this cake I already had this don't ask me why I'm this person but I stock up on things like this so I already had these candles two birthday cards greeting cards everything stocked up for like the next two years so I'm gonna bake this and then FaceTime her and I don't eat the entire thing I have a couple other cake mix things already but I didn't have any frosting and this one it comes with cream cheese frosting so and it's like the mini size cake I just put on this super springy lipstick this is retro matte by Mac in two matte with love I don't have any other makeup on right now I just kind of feel like putting on a lipstick just for funsies but I think I'm gonna actually film the IG TV tomorrow cuz anytime I film those I try and do it on a day when I already need to get ready for a different video so because I'm already filming tomorrow I'm just gonna do like a two and one but now my hair is done eyebrows are done I'm gonna do my nails later today while I watch a 90 day fiancé I'm addicted you guys okay I need to put the camera down for this season 4 of 90 day fiancé if you've never seen it start with season 4 it is wild oh my god there's so many crazy couples on that season and visa just blows my frickin mind do you love how direct she is like I also think that what's the name George George is like super complicit and all this because he's not standing up for himself at all and he made it seem like he was a different person than he actually is before she came over but Anfisa is just like ruthless with I mean she's honest so I give her that but whoa I'm not gonna spoil for anyone but go watch season 4 of 90 day fiancé and DME I need people to talk about 90-day fiance with because no one in my life watches it so I'm gonna try and finish up the thumbnails get the videos scheduled I made one thumbnail so far but I need to make the second one and then probably relax a little bit because it is Sunday but again I will leave
