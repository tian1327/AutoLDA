 okay I officially have all of my clients rescheduled hello good morning I look terrible whatever who cares today is Tuesday March 17th and I just spent my entire morning as well as our two last night trying to figure out my work schedule and reschedule all of my clients because we are in the middle of this coronavirus outbreak and yesterday the governor announced the statewide shutdown that means all non-essential stores bars and restaurants will close effective at midnight this is expected to last for two weeks but they're currently leaving pharmacies grocery stores and medical facilities open so salons and barbershops fell under the category of like non-essential stores so it's been hectic trying to go through my schedule and move people around and the thing too is like at least I want to say 60% of the clients that I had booked were my last clients so rescheduling them was extra tricky because now that I have to push their appointments back a few weeks they're probably not gonna have that many lashes left so rather than just keeping their appointment as like a one-hour fill timeslot they're gonna probably all need full sets so I need like double or triple that amount of time so I couldn't just like push everybody back two weeks you know everyone now needs like way more time so trying to figure out how I was gonna move everybody around and find times that worked with everybody's work schedules and stuff it was really crazy but now I'm done and I don't know what is gonna happen just a really stressful time for a lot of people and now my mom just said that they're saying on the news that this could get extended all the way until August and it's just really crazy and scary and it's like okay putting everything on lockdown for two weeks is one thing but if this ends up getting extended for a few months I mean financially it's just really scary I'm trying to just stay calm and just play it by ear take it a day at a time and see what happens so yeah I don't what this vlog is going to be but I just felt like I had to pull out the camera and kind of document what was going on right now there's a knowledge of how quickly and easily this disease spreads I ask all pennsylvania's to stay home I made a difficult decision to strongly urge non-essential businesses across the state to close for at least 14 days to help mitigate the spread we need to stay home if we want to save lives we need to work together if we want to save lives hello guys happy Wednesday it is day 2 of the quarantine and it's already almost 5 p.m. and as you can probably assume for my appearance I haven't done anything productive all day literally have not rained out of my pajamas I've just been disgusting I've just been sitting in bed watching YouTube videos basically just trying to kill time and you know distract myself I guess I can't believe like this is only the second day and I am already so bored but anyway I have just been feeling so disgusting I haven't showered in two days so I'm about to go get in the shower and just do some like self-care stuff because I feel like that will make me feel a lot better so need to shower wash my hair obviously maybe I'll do a self tanner and like a face mask alright let's go I did my little function of beauty leave-in hair mask I shaved all of this in the shower so I put this smooth meat ingrown hair serum from European Wax Center everywhere that I've shaved to prevent an ingrown but like razor from and all that stuff and I'm going to do my white strips I showed this in my last vlog I've been using the crest white strips again recently just like refresh the whiteness of my teeth so I'm going to set a timer for that for 30 minutes and then in the meantime I'm going to put on this face mask from drunk elephant this is the TLC used to carry baby facial this is a really good exfoliating mask I only do this like once every week or like once every other week it's really intense so you don't want to do it too often I'm gonna get beloved up these are just like reusable loves that I use when I color my hair and I'm gonna do May 10 the uLTA Beauty the Express and dark tinted boots and I just keep rubbing it in until it looks even and for my fact I just try my best I obviously can't believe reach it but it's still winter where I live I'm not going to be like showing my fair back anytime soon so it doesn't really matter to me but if I do ever need to get my back I'll usually just ask somebody to help me or what you could do to you have one of these like loofah things on a stick you could put your globe on the end of this and use this to get your back so it's a few hours later I'm feeling nice and refreshed I did my hair I mean obviously I'm not going anywhere but I just I don't know it just made me feel better floss my teeth awaitin to them did my face mask as you saw did a little self tanner I've just been watching YouTube videos in bed watching a lot of vlogs and specifically Carrie Dayton's vlogs I just love her she just keeps it so real she's just like a normal human being which is really refreshing but seeing these old vlogs of her like out with her friends and going out for lunch and getting drinks I'm like oh I miss going out in public even though it's only been two days I will say even though I know a lot of people are feeling very anxious right now and everything is like up in the air and it's scary but today I really was like trying to look on the bright side of things and I was thinking how you know we're all so busy we live in this world where we're just like go go go all the time and how often do you hear people say oh I would love to do XYZ but I just don't have time you know and now we all have nothing but time so all the things that you've been wanting to do like trying something new learning a new skill practicing something doing like just some self-care stuff like beauty giman things obviously things that you can do yourself at home spending time with family and friends even if you can't be with them in person but like just facetiming with them talking them on the phone and just taking time to like relax find some shows to binge on like Netflix or Hulu or something catch up on YouTube videos I feel like in some ways it's nice to get a little bit of a break it's kind of like a forced vacation for everybody I don't know I'm just really really trying to like be optimistic so yeah the rest of the night I'm probably just gonna stay in this exact same spot until I decide to go to sleep so I'll catch up with you tomorrow  today was a much more productive day than the last two days where I do my makeup I recorded three videos and now I'm hungry ready to go make some lunch and maybe make a drink cuz you know what I saw this meme that was like quarantine rules are the same as airport rules you can have a drink at 9:00 a.m. if you want so  I have spent the morning editing a video making the thumbnail for it so that is currently uploading and then I'm gonna put that to post now that that's all done I am gonna pull myself together and then me and my mom are gonna go outside and go for a walk it's really nice and sunny outside so I just need to go out get some fresh air and then I think we're gonna attempt to go to the grocery store because we are running low on some things and also I haven't left my house since Monday and I'm just kind of curious to see what it looks like out in town we were gonna go for a walk but it's a little chilly now so we're going to the grocery store first I just feel permanently disgusting like even though I took a shower right before I went to bed last night so like I'm clean technically my hair is clean but I feel filthy it's so isolated where we live anyway in the freakin woods so you can't even tell a difference because there's nothing up here anyway so I'm excited to see what it looks like in town I mean there's still a decent amount of people out but for a Saturday yeah it's a lot quieter especially for this time of day yeah this is like how it would be on a weekday in the morning yes like after nine ten o'clock once everybody's in their job right Dunkin Donuts is open is anybody inside just drive through and you're not allowed inside yeah I've never seen the line to chick-fil-a so short before decently busy     trying to sanitizer yeah yeah yeah I forgot mine thank you it really wasn't bad in there they were pretty stocked on produce but yeah like toilet paper paper towels that entire aisle was completely empty water was pretty empty pasta frozen foods that stuff was all pretty sparse Oh meats was like totally wiped out and there were a few people in there that had masks and gloves and stuff I think I saw like two or three maybe everyone else though seems like pretty normal and calm yeah there was a little kid in there that was just like running around pork thing you could tell has not been out of the house in a while guys I have a pimple I rarely break out anymore these days and I think that this has literally just been from like not eating the best not being as active as I normally am and just like laying around and being gross anyway I think this is gonna be the last update for this vlog I know this has been a little bit all over the place there really hasn't been like too much to vlog because I've just been staying inside and majority of my time has been spent sitting in bed let's see so far I've watched the entire first season of the show the Messiah they only have one season so far I got through the entire show the good place super good by the way I highly recommend if you're looking for something like light-hearted and just like funny I've watched several movies totally caught up on all my favorite youtubers video I've been trying to exercise and stay active as much as I can but like today the weather was horrendous it was freezing and raining all day we got some more news today as of March 23rd the governor of Pennsylvania issued a stay at home order and by the way this order takes place effective as of 8:00 p.m. tonight Monday March 23rd and will continue until April 6 which originally they were saying that we were gonna have to like do social distancing until April 1st so now this is getting pushed back about another week so that means I'm gonna have to reschedule my clients again I think at this point I'm probably gonna have to just like cancel everybody and then just wait until we find out when we're gonna be able to open up again because just continuously having to reschedule everyone is just like so stressful and it's like like what's the point if we don't know what's gonna happen you know I mean I I want everyone to be safe and healthy obviously it's just really crazy and really scary like when am I gonna be able to go back to work when are we going to be able to go back to normal life anyway that's gonna be it for this vlog I hope that you guys are all doing well talk to me in the comments let me know what you're doing to keep busy and to stay distracted let me know what shows in movies you've been watching and I'll see you guys in my next video bye
