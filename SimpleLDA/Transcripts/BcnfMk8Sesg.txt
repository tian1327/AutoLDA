just some places and then with my two fingers like this I'm gonna just gently massage it out remember that if you want higher cheekbones if you don't want your skin to Sag over the time be gentle with it and make sure that you're moisturizing it in an uplifting motion so I'm going like this you all right so I'm gonna take my pawns now I use my ring finger as well doesn't really matter the finger I just like using my ring finger and I'm just gonna do about like a couple of dots over my face I don't mind going a little bit on the heavy side when it comes to the screen because I have dry skin so it may look like a lot now once I finish it like literally about hour later like it's gonna look like I didn't even put anything on I think you get that girl you don't know man come in sagginess when you get older you see that like the skin is glowing she pumped she's ready I'm not gonna get my chapstick cuz that's what I put on next I forgot to bring it out in here so I'll be right back oh my Mac

the end but it's okay I'm not scared wow that's crazy maybe I should just leave the remains of those sighs anyway what am I dreaming I don't think we have no homage to singing we're gonna food

good as it's gonna get all right don't judge my waffles they're good they just a little bit on the well-done side yo this is matt baer assim because i know how to cook if you know me you know I know how to cook so it's just because it's a lot going on I'm trying to record for y'all and I'm trying to cook it's not as easy as you think all right yeah so I'm the type of person who would that eyes make food and if it's not as hot as when I make it I would that eyes heat it up again so that's all muscles ooh I must have just heat it up a little bit again so it could be hot matter of fact I'm gonna put my show on first and then imma heat it up so oh that's cool gonna be at the dinner table with me all right so it's time to eat um I got my big end of my waffles my applesauce some homemade tea made by my mother and I'm watching Love & Hip Hop of Elena for those of you who don't know i watch reality TV I love to see drama and I think this is like the season finale I saw a little clip last night with a girl oddvar she popped doing like spice she popped on that lace Ganesha girl and she was coming from Chicago I'm like a little baby I like to cut up my food first with white for me personally I like to buttermilk waffles but that's what we have not only really careful hold it up if it's not fresh fruits I'm putting on top of the waffles I don't really carefully all right yeah so I'm gonna go ahead and eat the schools and after I finish ear and watching the episode of The Love & Hip Hop I'm gonna show you how I do my makeup so I'll be back hey guys so I had to come outside because I'm going to get some jerk chicken from the best jerk chicken place around my way and this was that my elementary school PS 289 if you didn't come to this elementary school then you was not lit at all wait I must cut through the bottom part and basically I'm taking out with me for the day so I'm a little bit out of breath I think start getting anxiety y'all like I don't know why like every time I about to record my heart just start being a math s is the bottom part even open I really can't wait to outside open back up like I miss the park it's so beautiful outside I'm not sure they gaze really like you  me how do I get in the park they closed it I feel mad dumb they like this and he ever tell me  skateboarder you even told me I was not open I'm gonna dad have to walk around should have walked the other way cuz there's dead people in the park they don't unlock this look I can't even cut through okay oh I think that's because this is just a bottom part the bottom part is locks so imma have to walk around hey so I just put some lip gloss on cuz my lips with ashy but look memories this is dad Cosby hold on this is the Brooklyn Children's Museum this is how I look if you I watched my story time about the time I got in trouble for having a boyfriend this was the kid screw I was talking about this was kid school and that Park I just showed job I move over through the park when I come back secrecy but the park I just show job that's where I ran and this is the kids clue that I was skipped in so go watch that video if you didn't see that video go watch that video right now that is hilarious but today is a calm day I'm not really doing nothing big nothing special just showing y'all a day in my life would I be doing but outside is beautiful today it's so nice everybody is outside with AIDS old people is working out I should be one of these people is this girl right there look at all the dogs see look at other peoples and apart they not even supposed to be in a part but if it was us in the park we're gonna get locked up don't make no sense I really don't understand but that's the video for another day but anyways when I get to the arm jerk chicken spot I'm um pick the video back up cuz right now I'm just walking in I'm a child so right now I'm at peppers this house I just ordered me and my mother two orders of jerk chicken only in three Festival rolls it's like these sweet dough bread something like that pop out here to get your drink chicken this is one umm no string and prospect so yeah but I'm gonna pop back out when I vlog because I hate when people stop staring at me and I'm where you come from I just walk past like a little on see everybody making noise this is so cute so I just walk past a little that's like a little Hospital back there and all the nurses and doctors and that's the speaker right there basically just thanking all the people who help out in the hospital for doing their work I appreciate you guys as well thank you guys so much for being on the front lines and being brave enough to tackle this virus thank you guys for your service and y'all so I got the food they don't give out plastic bags anymore they stop that a while ago so that's why I have to carry it like this my mom I was gonna walk up that same block I just came but I didn't walk up that block because for some reason it was mad  outside and I'm the type of person if I know I don't want people speaking to me or trying to talk to me i'ma just avoid you so that like they don't get offended when I say no or think I'm hold on or think I'm trying to extinct so I just be trying to avoid big crowds especially if I'm by myself so that's why I didn't get a chance to walk up that block so I could cut through the part but you're gonna see the park it's gonna be here all summer I'm really so proud of myself because I don't even do stuff like this I'll be like people be very slow mommy like what the I don't even do like this because I don't be wanting people to be all in my face like I'm really a shy person I don't like attention on me and I'm really facing my fears right now vlog in and the open because so much people think all in my face and I just been trying to ignore them and look at y'all but if it's just tired I haven't speed walking but now you're gonna see 289 I went here from 1st to 5th grade and the school was lit as well by far one of the best schools I ever went to like we had the best events like every day there was literally something to do I miss elementary school every child I just got back in the house and I'm  hot I'm hot I was literally sweet looking like cuz I do not like being outside I like being outside but like being in the hood like I don't like being on Soph too long but so I'm back in the house my face is oily that's cute though hydrated but yes I wash my hands anytime you guys go outside the first thing you need to do take off your clothes and go straight to the bathroom washing hands then could do whatever you want to do stay safe y'all um but as of right now I kind of just want to cool down and you're gonna be with me for the whole day so I'm a per most likely pop back on here when I start

cautious hey guys so I'm back you
