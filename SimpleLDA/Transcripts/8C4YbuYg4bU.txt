  so today we're doing a current-i an update video because I remember last time I show you guys I was going on when everything started and now it's been I don't even know how long it's been I think it's been more like 2 months or something but yeah it's been a while since my CD situation started and it's crazy I've been staying at home literally not going out even for a grocery it's starting to get me because spring and it's so beautiful out like so so sunny I need to clean my windows I know but yeah it's so sunny and I literally just want to go out but my outfit it's very very sick I'm wearing just like a t-shirt and some pants yeah very simple it's just like some carbs they're both in quality if you want to like to check your t-shirt a little bit really tuck it on the ground and it works great so yeah that's really good tip anyways I hope you guys are doing well I'll do it this time I know it's super hard staying at home doing nothing and then see in social media where everyone is supposed to you that they're doing productive stuff and doing so many things and yeah I know good people in society or do it like I don't know in my case I actually sometimes even feel like useless or that I'm like wasting my time when there's nothing we can do like honestly like what can you do when you cannot even go out you know it's such a hard time for so many people I actually wanted to share what I've been doing when I was improve I actually went through therapy because I went through a little situation where I needed like to go to therapy and just like I said Carthoris actually and it hummus so much so during this time I thought like I really needed someone to talk to or when I'm gonna like answers or when I'm done and just like I know bent and I'd be using better help which is therapy sessions online actually using on your phone and your computer your tablet like anywhere and it's online I feel just humans to need someone to talk to basically you make an account and they will match you with the counselor in 24 hours or less and the therapists are actually certified by their state's board to provide therapy and counseling just put what whatever your needs are we have anxiety depression or body issues or like whatever and you just put all your needs and they will match you with the counselor that actually specializes on that which is actually credible because sometimes when you go to like a college a psychiatrist they don't necessarily specialize on what you need honestly like every time I feel like things aren't getting on me I would just go in the website on my phone actually I use it on my phone and just I talk to my counselor it's available to work why because it's online so I don't want to use it and it's $65 per week it's even more affordable because I actually tried once to go to like a psychiatrist in New York and it was like a $250 per session which is like a hundred percent above my budget so I literally never went with her she was so expensive you wanna try self you can actually get 10% off the first month so yeah I think you want to try it out actually now we're we're going through health crises and we just need someone to talk to yeah you should just try out and I've been so motivated and I read on my bedroom I think my bedroom was like so back now or because now it looks so much better oh yeah I'm gonna show you guys what we did it one of the first things is that we put that show up there because I really felt like it look really empty so I quit that job over there I don't know I just think it looks really cute I was a little bit of room but I actually put it on my background dude I'm gonna change that lamp because it's so big when I order them I thought they would be like smaller I change the nightstand and put it on this side and here I have like my stones a crystal and one of my favorite perfumes this one is so so good I actually bought that frame on society6 from I an artist and I'm upset and then we have my bed which is just like very basic I actually painted this piece of furniture that if you remember it was Green the actions record I'll show you guys we are painting it white we actually this is the third time or because it turned out blue and now it's actually white my mom basically put all these tactics because if it were me I wouldn't put all this plastic and it would be a mess this is what my kitchen looks like right now I just like everything white I don't know why I thought I wanted color and then when I started adding color I went back to doing all white again then we added those two prints which you know I like black and white so you had to be black and white that's a TV like a little lamp here to do my makeup and yeah this was vintage but I actually bought one of those kitchen round things that you can just twist and I put this on top of it I don't like a DIY thing I put this over here anyways today I woke up it's my second copy because I was shooting with a friend and she's a photographer she does FaceTime shoot and I'm so excited and I could show you but yeah that's what I did earlier this morning this is a makeup I did I'm wearing this new lipstick from mac cosmetics in Salina collection I don't even know what color it is is like my new favorite and I don't have much going on today besides editing another video that I have for you I think I have to open some packages and that's pretty much it so my camera died but that's pretty much it for today I really hope you guys enjoy this video and thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in my next video
