perfect example of not adhering to social distancing guidelines my god of such an idiot no it smells like french fries you guys that's myself nightmares were real last night anyway I'm up it is I don't know dangerous March 30th oh yeah it's Monday I got a couple of clips last night outside our yesterday evening what was going on out there so anyway um I'm gonna try to wake up and finish my coffee here that's watered down but I need to medicate two bees I feel really nauseous my dreams last night were crazy just so tired honey who I will talk to you guys probably hearing a bit after I wake up I need to do a stream today so for church service I need to wake up and get prepared for that although I do need to go to the store because I don't have any wraps medication anyway she'll talk to you guys leader hey guys so it's now 504 I had the stream it was good I couldn't decide between two services so I had chat helped me decide there was only a couple of us in there I think Danny was the only one in there at the time so the beginning of the stream so I watched one and then I played some animal crossing and then I caught my sister back just the chicken and stuff she's gonna call me back here soon but I did called the doctor's office to see if the new telehealth appointment said that my ulti management doctor he does now if they're covered by my insurance and so they said yes it should be they've had a couple of people with my insurance use it and it went fine so I made an appointment for tomorrow at 3 p.m. for pain management over the phone so that's gonna be good and then I have therapy tomorrow to you at noon so she called me today just to you know remind me that we do have an appointment tomorrow so because last week I missed the appointment because I totally forgot and she apparently I made her worry so mean to be that but um anyway I think I'm gonna call her a little bit I did finally get breakfast which is that's what's left it was some Parmesan chicken with some noodles and stuff and I put some Parmesan cheese on top but that's how much I have left of that so man I need to medicate though because my stomach is hurting food yeah I'm I think I'm going to color and probably watch them Stargate Atlantis or I might just leave Animal Crossing on the TV like it is now and try to play some animal crossing like switch between coloring and animal crossing so so I did just pay off my loan so that was awesome and that was fun in the game I bought a house I upgraded from a tent to a house and there was a ninety eight thousand bail the currency in the game is Belle's but I I had a loan of 98 thousand bells so I just paid that off today too so yeah you for that and I can expand my house to which I might do I don't know I have to decide but it's currently raining in the game and I freaking love it but anyway that's my update for you guys I'm gonna relax and yeah talk to y'all later right here we're all clapping Wow that was awesome so at 7:00 p.m. New York has been uh cheering outside their windows for essential workers and stuff during the pandemic and yeah I got to participate this time I'm glad I heard it I was like something's going on I was like all are they cheering again for essential workers because I missed it the first time I heard about it was after the fact I think is the next day after the first time so yay that's awesome that's great anyway um I will talk to you guys later I'm coloring so um but yeah I thought I would share that and experience it with you guys but yeah I almost knocked my camera out the window oops but good thing I didn't sell any who I'll talk to you later the things we do to entertain children hey guys so it is the 31st it is 3:00 3:14 I just got off my tella my first telehealth appointment for pain management and it went great she was super nice um it was totally weird for me I mean I'm pretty sure she's used to it she seemed super comfortable and at ease and stuff so it helped me feel a little bit calmer and everything but I'm like still a little shaky because I'm anxious from it but um they gave me a they're calling in a prescription of course um I think it's called so Fran I don't know it's for nausea and then she's also calling me at a prescription in for a two-week supply of tramadol so yeah it went really well I'm gonna call my sister back but it was weird because I've seen videos online about like what it looks like to be have a telehealth appointment and stuff and so it was kind of weird to like be in that situation but like it seems so familiar but it's the first time to you was awesome like why can't we have more doctors appointments like that because it's hard we're gonna make it you know that distance so I mean this it would be awesome like if I could just do telehealth appointments for some of this stuff it'd be like like a consultation or whether initial appointments and then I come back like I go and get the tests and then we do another telehealth appointment because it's not like they're running these tests themselves and everything like cardiologist and everything so but that was pretty cool and really easy and it went by super quick to do so but um anywho yeah I'm gonna call my sister right now and tell her and yeah I will talk to you guys later hey guys so it is 10:19 now um I took the tram at all it's not kicking in yet so I'm assuming that I'm having some digestive issues today or this evening I did decide that I'm going to wait and hold off on the generic zofran or whatever it's called on dense and Terra whatever I don't know something generic pers Oh Frank because I looked up because I'm uncertain about this one if it has any effects on the heart and everything so I looked it up and it says it can make tachycardia and stuff worse so rather than risking that I went ahead and just decided not to take that until I can get back my cardiologist can get back to me so well let me know if it's safe for me to take it or not I did to go ahead and take a tram at all I did a half of one and then I waited over an hour and I didn't feel it so I took another half so well that was mistake anyway but yeah I'm gonna hold off i shooted here back within 48 hours if I don't then I'm supposed to call the practice and ask them directly so anywho I'm gonna play some animal crossing Danny taught me how to plant other trees other fruit trees so I'm pretty excited about that I planted two cherry trees already so I don't know how long it takes for them to grow to be full size but I want to plant all of them now so yeah hey Hugh you guys later hey guys so it's 2:26 in the morning first - the tramadol hours ago what happened didn't feel it at all so I took another the other half which was too hopeful which is what I was prescribed for twice a day those feelin delicious the charges like animal crossing stars like are they like you know so soon as I stand up the knowledge are really its I guess whatever's going on with my son but that delay like we three bucks something in okay it's just acid reflux this in the past I've been able to push through the nausea and acid while having ass reflux and it's been fine so I thought that this was going to be one of those times boy is talking about projectile holy crap TMI but you know that's life right so it was bad like I was even just to I was still choking on it like a couple of minutes going on spotting my sinuses another but clean that up too much better than I do so I think but see I have to remember that those I can it can be up to six hours sometimes report my
