 Shoutout to SQUARESPACE for sponsoring today's video! I have some things to update you guys. A few days ago, my sister drove all the way down here. With her boyfriend and Nemo. My sister has another cat. And Nemo and the other cat has been fighting for months. And we were like, "It is time to bring Nemo back home." So, he's back home now. I'll show you guys later in the vlog. But right now, they went to get my car's oil changed. I'm very thankful that they were willing to do that for me. Because I wasn't going to do that myself. But... It's been really nice to have someone to hang out with. And to talk to. We've been cooking together a lot, we've been eating good food. We've been playing Animal Crossing together. I also bought a Nintendo Switch for myself. It's coming in this Friday! And I am SO excited! Oh my gosh! I've been trying to resist. But then, I was like...No, I need it. I'll do an unboxing later when that gets here. But I got ready today. Because I have some pictures I need to take for this interview that I'm doing. And I wanted to look good, obviously. So I did my makeup this morning. I try to wake up a little earlier. I've been waking up around 9 AM. That is quite early for me because I used to wake up at 11 AM. But I've been trying to go to bed early. And wake up early. So I woke up early. Ate breakfast. Did my morning workout. Now, I am all ready. I did some work. Also, my internship ends this Friday. So, after that, I'll be free! I'll be able to play my Animal Crossing! And oh my gosh, it sounds so good! I need to change. So I need to figure out what I'm gonna wear. But I just wanted to update you guys what's been going on in my life. Because...yeah. My life has been a little different. But my sister is leaving soon. So I'm a little sad about that. I wish she could stay. But...Yeah. At least I have Nemo now, so I won't be as bored. Nemo! Nemo, say hi to the camera! They missed you! Come on Nemo! Com on! Nemo! Yeah, come on! Let's go downstairs. My sister went out to get my car's oil changed. And she just texted me: "Want something from Chick-Fil-A?" That is the most beautiful text I've ever received. Um...What do I want? I want... Fries. Also, my sister brought her projector here. So we're going to watch "Heart Signal" on the projector. Imagine eating Chick-Fil-A, watching "Heart Signal"! That is the best thing ever! Ready to watch "Heart Signal." I told them I would be eating Chick-Fil-A, but look what I'm eating now! A salad.  You guys saw the first few clips of me updating you guys when my sister was here. I couldn't really vlog when she was here. Just because we were all kind of occupied doing our work. And also because we were just hanging out. I wasn't thinking a lot about... Like getting content or filming. So I don't have a lot of footage from when she was here. But while she was here, we had a lot of family time that we couldn't have. When she was away. We cooked together a lot as a family. We ate good food. We watched TV, watched tiktoks together. It was really fun. But she went home. And you guys just saw, Nemo is still with us. He's going to be staying with us now. I'm making a toast, with bacon, egg. And probably some fruits.   I also had this mini Kind bar. This is so tiny. It's literally gone in 2 bites. But it was a nice little treat at the end of my meal! I really want to drink coffee, but I'm not going to. Because I've been trying to cut down on my caffeine intake. I'm going to give myself 4 hours to get everything I need to get done today to maximize my productivity level. That way, I'll actually be productive. And not waste time. Because right now, it's 12 O'clock. Almost 12 O'clock. So from 12 to 4 PM, I'm gonna do whatever I need to do. And then from 4 PM to whenever I decide to go to bed, I'll be completely free to do whatever I want. This is what happens when you read a self-help book in the morning. I was reading a book today. And it told me to... I don't know how the book ordered it, But it told me to minimize the time you give yourself
to maximize your productivity level. If that makes sense. So that's what I'm doing. Or that's what I'm trying today. I also started Chloe Ting workout Challenge that everyone's been doing. Keeping up with her workout plan makes me feel stronger every time I do it. Because I can actually notice how strong I've gotten. Because, for example... This workout used to do, I could barely make it through halfway. But now, I can pretty much do the whole thing
with 1-2 pauses in between, which is so great. I am getting stronger. And I can actually see myself getting better at them. So it motivates me to do them. I'm doing the Summer Challenge she started a few days ago. I'm gonna do that workout probably after dinner. But yeah. I just wanted to talk about it. Because I'm not usually the type to keep up with these workout plans. But it's been fun. It's been nice. And everyone's been doing it. So it's been pressuring me to do it. But it also motivates me. In the best way. Not in a negative way. It's not making me do this when I don't want to be doing it. But yeah. I'm blabbering now. Bye. I don't know if you can hear my oven. But I'm cooking my salmon right now. So I thought it would be the perfect time for me to talk to you guys about my new favorite shows. I started "Outerbanks" last week. I watched the first episode. And I was like 'eh, I don't know how I feel about it.' And then, 3 days ago, I just watched the 2nd episode. And I binge-watched the whole thing in a day. So, you guys know that it was a good show. I really liked it. The show is about these teenagers living in an island, looking for a treasure. There are a lot of crimes involved, there is a love-line. I don't know what it is about the show, but it really hooked me in. I think it's the setting, too. They're just running around with no phones. And it was just nice to see something like that. So I really liked "Outerbanks." It's like number 2 on Netflix right now. So I would highly, highly recommend it. And then... A few days ago, I posted on Instagram, asking you guys to comment on your favorite show. So many people commented "Extracurricular." I've been hearing so many good things about this show that I thought 'OK, I'm gonna watch it.' Usually, it takes me about 1-2 episodes to get really drawn in. But this show got my attention from the very beginning. So, it had a really good beginning. It had a really good first episode. And I'm currently on episode 10. And I just started this 2 days ago! And I've been trying to control myself. So I don't finish the whole thing in 1 day. But this was also really good. It is a deeper show. It definitely has a lot of meanings behind everything. I'm never the one to binge-watch Netflix shows. But here I am. I have all the time in the world right now. I've been on this Netflix-cake that I haven't been on in a while. I'm so excited to finish "Extracurricular." I'm sad about it, though. Because I really like the story. And I like the characters. I like the actors in it. So, yeah. I'm kind of sad to be done with "Extracurricular." But after this, I'm gonna watch "The Society." And then I'm going to watch "Never Have I Ever." Guess what time it is! It is time for Animal Crossing. I filmed the unboxing. But I look busted in that video. I just don't look good.  I got the turquoise Nintendo Swith Light. This was literally the only thing that was not sold-out. Let me show you... All of my pictures that I took! I literally log in every day. Around sunset time. And I take pictures. Like this. Isn't that hilarious? Oh my gosh! That was my first day. Look how... Bad I looked. And then... This is my sister and me. That's like the character of my sister's boyfriend. But we met up. And we took lots of pictures. Look how adorable! 
I'm really glad that I woke up pretty early today. It's only 9 AM. I went to bed really early yesterday. Like 11 PM. Which is crazy for me. But I'm proud. And I think I'm gonna go downstairs and eat some breakfast. Also, today is "Heart Signal" day. And...Oh my gosh! I'm so excited! Because usually, I do all of my work and then watch it at the end of the day. But now, I can just watch it whenever I want. I don't even know if it's up yet. But we'll see. I'm so excited to watch it. My plan for today is... 
I still have to finish up answering some interview questions. 
So I'm gonna do that while drinking my coffee. And then... I'm going to watch "Heart Signal." I can't believe it's already been a week. Because last week, I watched it upstairs with my sister and her boyfriend on the TV. But now, I have to watch it by myself, which is kind of sad. And I think I might go on a drive by myself later. I mean, I love being with my family. I love being at home. But sometimes, I miss the times when I used to... Get in my car, turn on music, and drive around while singing on the top of my lungs. So I think I might do that. And while I'm on a drive, I might stop by Trader Joe's which is my favorite grocery store around here. And pick up some things that our family could eat. So, yeah. I love going on little adventures by myself. But I can't go around. And do that anymore, which is kind of sad. I also told you guys a while ago that I want to decorate my room and make a vlog about it. But the thing is, it's kind of hard to order everything online. Especially things like plants. I definitely want to have plants in my room. It's hard to order that online. I could find a way, but it's expensive. It takes time. And it's just... It is too much work. So we're going to put a hold on that for a while. And just live in the room that I have. Because it's perfectly fine the way it is.  I have no idea what I look like right now. Because it's so sunny. I can't see the screen. Hopefully, I don't look horrible. But I'm outside right now. I just went out for a walk for like 30 minutes. And then I changed clothes. I put on some sunscreen. And I decided that it might be nice to sit out here and soak up the sun. Because I've been spending way too much time inside. I brought my Nintendo Switch out here. I'm gonna sip on my iced water. Listen to some podcasts. I was just listening to "Anything Goes" by Emma Chamberlain. I might turn on some music because I just finished one. I'm just gonna chill out here.  I just picked up some mail from a mailbox. Now I have to go to the post office to drop something off. And then I'm gonna go to the grocery store. That is the end of my vlog for this week. Thank you guys so much for watching until the end. I know I took a break off from vlogging last week. It was a very nice break for me where I just got to relax and not have to worry about editing.
