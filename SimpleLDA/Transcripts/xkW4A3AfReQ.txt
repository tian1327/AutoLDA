  good morning everyone it is currently 10:00 a.m. I'm about to jump on a call with a new client of mine I'm really excited this one is a friend of mine so I am giving her a little discount helping raise my portfolio increase my portfolio I look like garbage right now I like can't one of myself lose its camera I've just been so self conscious lately about how I look and I'm in quarantine so like why does it matter but I don't know anyways it the call is in two minutes but I wanted to just say good morning until you guys I'm vlogging today and I'm really excited because that break from vlogging just really refreshed me and I'm like so excited now to vlog so I think it's I think it's healthy to do that bloggers out there if you want a Prayag tape break okay anyways I've also started being more active on LinkedIn I don't really connect with everyone though okay I've got received a law a lot of law of connections and I do decline a lot of them because I don't just want to have a bunch of random people in my connections I try to only connect with people that I know because I used to like when I was first in college I literally said yes to every single person that requested me and now I'm like why did I do this so I don't know what are your tips for LinkedIn I'm so new to it I'm trying to learn it so let me know cuz I I don't really know any like best practices on LinkedIn anyways I had to jump on this call so I'll talk to you guys later hey guys so it's been a few hours later ate some avocado toast doing some work just reached out to a ton of influencers for one of my clients and I'm sending out free food so I think that most people say yes right now I was just checking my email responding to a ton of emails seeing what else I had to do this week just to stay organized I definitely think this is gonna keep me very very busy might take a Youtube break then might work out or might watch YouTube while I'm working yeah but one of the videos that I want to save my friend Rabia so if you guys don't know she was on my podcast we have been really good friends since middle school um she just started a YouTube channel so I really want to shout her out because she's Lou I am NOT just saying this because she's my friend she's my favorite vlogger at the moment with only two videos up so this is our third video and it's not a vlog but is by far my favorite vlogger her personality is contagious it's just the most positive uplifting person and she moved to the Netherlands so I love keeping up with her through that but it's also just really cool seeing how people in the Netherlands live compared to people the United States and she just did a video comparing it so I'm about to watch it but please check out her vlogs because they are so good and I'm not just saying that like they're actually very very good anyways I think what I'm gonna do is work out right now while watching a video so let's go I'll show you guys my workout outfit of the days I am wearing this fabletics sports bra she were cute fabletics leggings and I'm doing upper body today so still doing Kallie fuller fit she is amazing I love her um yeah I'm excited to work out    done working out it was hard with did Kelly Fleur fit upper body and abs feel strong that was really hard no I'm not good at the old not good at the whole saying onto the vlog squad the blogspot what did you get it okay I have been drinking two coffees a day this time it's an iced coffee now I have a podcast so just gonna start setting up for that   hey guys so we just finished with my podcast it was a really great episode it's funny though because I'm interviewing two guys that started wealth without Wall Street which is kind of like an online community for people creating passive income and they are like super anti stock market so I've had like my financial advisor who is a very pro stock market and then I also have like these people who are very anti stock market so it's just gonna be really interesting hearing the two sides and I always want to share people's stories and give tips because not everyone thinks the same thing and also when it comes to money there is literally no right answer I think the only thing people agree on is like saving money but like besides that there is no right anti answer on how to spend or invest your money even how to save there's like differing opinions about that so I'm interested to have those guys and I thought it was a pretty cool episode and I was also on their podcast uhm I've literally been working all day I have been building PR lists for influencers and guys I am someone that I don't necessarily know everything about this business that I am starting I know a lot and I'm giving myself a lot of credit but this is still new territory for me I didn't get a job at a PR company out of school so this is very new I'm kind of being self-taught and I think that's really interesting and I think that's just any business you learn along the way goals one day is to have an office in New York City I'll be so amazing that would literally just be so incredible with like a few people I never want it to be like too big because the whole point of it is to create personal relationships with brands and with influencers so I'm really hoping that I keep it small but where that small feeling still because I'm really I really don't like the way corporations are run that much I just think that there's too many layers and I just love the feeling of small businesses so that's one of my goals one day a lot of you guys probably have no idea what I'm talking about I'm sorry if this vlog is kind of all over the place but I started Barbie agency it's the same as my consultations it's not a new business it's literally just an extension of it I feel like I have to say that every time because I don't want people to think like oh my god you're starting something else like this has always been the end goal of me like if you look at my business plan in the beginning like this was it and I didn't really have like a real business plan but if you look at my document where I wrote down my ideas this was always in the plan from before I even started this company but I'm really happy that it's kind of coming to life now I have more time and I think so much more productive and Quarantine than I thought and really happy about that but I'm just tired and I have a consultation in ten minutes so I have another one coming up and then I'm done with work for the day I don't know what you guys have been up to and also if you guys have any questions for me you guys could leave them down below I feel like I need to do a proper update video because I have been gone for so long on YouTube that I should probably sit down and do like a real like hey guys this is what's the deal with what I've been up to um but let me know if you guys want to see that or if vlogs are enough for you I'm just excited to be walking again and I'm also counting down the days so I can go back to New York City  I am so bad at this game oh my god I should have stayed in I have a two pair why did I okay guys I am about to sit down and read my Bible to unwind I just had dinner with my family I had spaghetti and hotdogs and it was great but I feel like I worked a lot today so I kind of want to do like a stretch and then also read my Bible to relax and unplug so I think I'm gonna do that first I just want to be off a screen like I just I fit on a screen for too long and I'm even on a screen when I'm like talking to my boyfriend because it's there FaceTime so it's just like exhausting pink on a screen at all times so I really just want to unwind and like not look at my phone so that's turning over because I don't want to look at it take my Bible a lot of you guys have asked me where I got this I got this years ago yeah I might have been a senior in high school when I go but anyways I love it I love it because I have taken so many notes in it so it's cool like if I stumble upon something that I took notes in like years ago I can kind of see what my thought process was back then compared to what it is now because I don't know I just feel like whenever you read the Bible everything something new pops out every single time I don't know about you guys but that's how I feel and then I also have a Bible study so this I will have linked down below but I'm trying to just read the Bible and really get to know the context I'm like the history and really get to know like all of the biblical stories so I have this just to fill out along the way and really some really cute Bible study I know that doesn't matter but it's really nice yeah I mean the Old Testament I'm finishing up 2nd samuel today if you guys were curious so let's let's just read  okay so it is a little later okay so it is a little later and I am playing poker with jion's family okay guys I need to document this 446 points and kion has o o P pop back
