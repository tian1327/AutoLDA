  hey guys welcome back to my channel so based on the title you guys already know what this video is gonna be about today I'm just going to be doing a quick blog of my graduation it's really just for those of you who didn't get the chance to watch me walk across the stage obviously and have really a traditional graduation but my school did try their best to make it as normal as possible just keep watching you can just kind of want to see what I did throughout the day thank you for being here make sure you're subscribed make sure you give this video a thumbs-up and goodbye okay so first things first y'all know I gotta get my hair done and I decided to go blonde for graduation because why not I have mixed emotions about it because here's the thing I love honey blonde hair which is why but now that it's actually on my body I don't like the way it looks because it's literally almost the exact same color as my complexion and I feel like I looked washed out I was thinking about dyeing it like you knew box dry and just like doing the darker color but I think I'm gonna I think I want to keep it so  this is my very first time doing my eyebrows in almost a full year and I was just trying to grow them out fortunately I was successful because they are thick however it was such a painful process because of it there were tear drops running down my eyes but it was definitely worth it even when I get my eyebrows professionally done they never match like ever the only time I ever got my eyebrows to match was when I got them shaved this one time by this barber and they never go back the same until like now because I threw them out for a whole year so I wasn't gonna run out again and that's just because he made them way too thin so that they could match this one's always been thicker even though it which is weird because it had that patch in there but it was always thicker right here I don't know why it just is but I'm gonna clean this up anyway and see this might have been a mistake I don't know we'll see I mean the good thing is if I completely rip my eyebrows I can just feel it   hey guys so it's 2:15 it's officially the day of graduation my ceremony is at 6:30 I do have to be there like 6:10 so I'm gonna start getting ready at about 4 o'clock maybe a little bit earlier because I do have to call my hair and get my makeup and all that so we'll see  Toshiko Ashley row    after finally getting the chance to ring the senior Bell we went and took some photos it was really dark so I never got as many pictures as I liked but I got enough to remember the day
