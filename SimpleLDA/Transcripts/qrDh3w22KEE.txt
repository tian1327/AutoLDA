  what's up guys and welcome back to my channel hope you guys are doing well and staying safe at home I thought I'd do a kind of quarantine vlog since we've all been at home and I wanted to reorganize my pantry kind of got inspired by tic-tock and then YouTube and then Pinterest so I bought a bunch of these storage jars from Amazon and they came pretty fast I want to say less than a week I am still waiting on the spice jars a smaller version of this which is coming this week but I'm just gonna put everything all in one video but do it as they come so I just don't have hella jars laying around I forget the exact measurement of this specific one but I bought ten of these because I knew that I would utilize this one the most and then I think I ordered some bigger ones I actually don't remember but I'll leave everything that I purchased down in the description bar and I thought I'd just take you guys along the pantry reorganization and yeah let's get started  I also forgot to buy a funnel so it's gonna be real messy up in here so this is what it looks like it turned out so cute  pretty much felt what I needed to fill in these jars right here I still have about four left but I'm trying to decide what I should put in them and if I need to order more but I wanted to show you guys the big canisters that I have I believe these are from Bed Bath & Beyond if they are I have to get more because these just store bigger quantities of things that we use a lot so oats sugar chia seeds we use a bunch and then almonds and then rice over here I just need to label these real quick  okay so I technically realized that I didn't even have to order her spice jars because the spices that I usually get from our local grocery store they're already made out of glass and then they have these labels on them but I tried peeling one earlier just out of curiosity and they came off so easily like they didn't leave that sticky residue like stickers usually do you see how I'm just peeling it off right now and I've just been replacing it with the black labels that I've been using for everything else and it looks so good the only difference is that it doesn't have that bamboo top but still looks good to me and I saved money so I might just cancel the order or just return it since it already shipped so these just arrived in the mail and I knew that it was gonna be a little bit too small but I want to show you guys anyways and compare it to like the regular size spice jars from the supermarket so this is the jar that I ordered and thought would be the perfect size and this one holds about two ounces and this one is the standard grocery store size and this one is about four ounces if I were to transfer the original packaging into these cute ones that I would still have a lot left over anyways and it wouldn't really be saving me that much space so I am going to be returning these they are super cute but they aren't really that practical for this situation and I don't know what else I would be using it for just because it is super small so I have all my spices here which like I said earlier worked out because this was the original packaging from the grocery store and then I put more of these jars up here I wanted to buy more in Amazon but they are actually sold out at the moment so this video wasn't supposed to be my coffee station but I thought I'd show you guys cuz the jars are in here also this is my coffee side so in the bigger jars I had the chocolate instant coffee in the cafe du monde for my Vietnamese coffee and then I have my old least stash here I have my black tea my jasmine tea I have golden black tea back there and then also have my matcha so that is the end of the video I hope you guys liked it I know it's not technically a pantry we do live in a New York City apartment where the kitchen is super small so we had to make do with what we have and just call our little shelf our pantry but yeah if you guys want to see a full coffee and tea collection for my or its a card tea coffee and tea station let me know because I do have a lot of glassware and different types of teas and coffees and knickknacks yeah thank you guys for watching and I'll see you the next video
