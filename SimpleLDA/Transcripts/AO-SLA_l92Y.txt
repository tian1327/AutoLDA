  the key ignition listen you hold me back whenever the last keep talking all your  I mean how are they started your ass brokenhearted you flip my words yeah this love hurts keep talking all your keep talking my baby  good morning everyone it is a Monday morning it is currently 8:00 a.m. we'll go at 7:30 world around but for a little bit stretch for a little and now I'm up at my workstation just trying to tackle all the tasks and what I do every single day before I go to bed is I write down all of my tasks I have to do so in my little notebook right here I have like my itinerary kind of stretched out all the tax I have to do besides my tasks for the day I'm actually gonna do this while I do my new face I'm gonna use a little bit of the sea or a sample as a base because I don't have the primer and I actually do have a whole video on YouTube around what alternatives you can use and how exactly to use the new face so this is my morning ritual so yeah you guys have probably have heard me talk about this golden coil notebook all the time on Instagram as well as YouTube but this notebook has been a godsend for me and I can't believe it's already April in a couple of dates so now I have my new week laid out I are you started writing in it last night planner and kind of setting goals for myself and tasks for myself but I absolutely have to finish on a daily basis that allows me to kind of stay on track even while I am quarantined at home you're just like staying at home all day it feels like you're not really actually working and so easy to kind of fall on the truck there's watching Netflix shows during the daytime I never ever do that I make sure that I'm at least working from 8:00 to 6:00 every day and some brainy social errands or you know actually having an hour long lunch and that kind of stuff throughout the day but other than that I don't really have like all these good time and like easy really really busy so that after dinner time then I can actually relax and all of that so so this is gonna be the first to like a stay home with Ava series because I do want to show you guys some little snippets of what I to incorporate some skincare beauty and lifestyle things there in my vlogs because I feel like those are a little bit more natural and then we'll still be doing like a review videos to tell videos and all that but this is a lot more casual you can actually see me incorporating and using these products in real life well now that I have my little water I'm gonna just write down some of the other tasks and  so this is what my journal looks like now it is April time sorry on my calendar and then I have my idea notes so typically I kind of write down my content ideas he or whether it is tick tock or Instagram or YouTube and other ideas that kind of jot down by that and then I do help my project so whether it is a YouTube project that I want to tackle like a certain topic then I will write that there there are other price that I gets filled up throughout the month so I'm excited to write my first one out and this is my favorite page where I write down my goals and then bimonthly goals so I typically write down you know like if it's a wedding related all the tasks I have to do related to wedding and then goals for the month and see if I tackle those two so you know working out is a big goal and I wanted at least do it five to six times a week so I'm going to see if I can keep through it with that cutting up sugar I shall do that now we get into my first week so these are work really the things I wanted to personal things and other priorities that I want to get into gratitude and some other habits that I do every day so that's kind of a pendant but I like having that little reminder here as well so this is my breakfast this morning with the banana bread I made yesterday I can post a recipe I'm soon and I'm Aiden a Photoshop opportunity on BET because it was just too cute not to capture so I had my coffee I'll show you guys the final picture that I did produce but now I'm actually gonna indulge and enjoy this so I'm gonna do a workout class with my friends right here setup so we're gonna be doing some cell chop workout right here  I just finished a workout that's pretty fun so now I'm just gonna go make a little protein smoothie   there's my smoothie I think it's so important to do some workouts at home what with your friends are doing lives it feels like a natural workout class you feel accountable you can't really rest during the time so it's stupid fun so I encourage you guys to get your friends together do a zoom and then tune into a live class it was so fun I'm definitely gonna be doing more of these sessions and now here we go okay we are venturing outside right now because I desperately need some food Trader Joe's that next to us is closed because someone working there apposite tested positive for 12 in 19 so and all these delivery I'll see that right now so I'm literally going to check out a fruit planet because sometimes they sell obviously fruit and veggies as well so the only option I have right now wish me luck okay so you just went to the fruit mark this morning and this is everything that I got I got this whole bag of bananas there's like freaky seven or eight in it for one dollar and the rest was slightly pricier but still I'm so happy that I

everything I got from prechew Surrey I'm so grateful I was able to get these juices during these times so I'm definitely gonna take advantage of these shots and juices and just try to stay hydrated and healthy humor delivery finally came after three weeks I am deeply regretting not getting more because my order like weeks ago we didn't think we would be in a situation like this but anyway chinami is the best ramen don't argue with me it's my favorite ramen effort some radish it's an essential of the fridge to make so many different things especially some hot best crackers I really wanted my fianc√©e to try these because apparently has never tried this whole number before oh my god another spam for living on family I feel like so many things on there were like overpriced than

then we got soonduk you guys don't know what this is you might get grossed out but this is one of the best Korean dishes I thought I got more ramen you know yeah we didn't get three Romans because they were all out this is the reality we were just checking on the things that we got and we have a couple of things that are missing even though they said it wasn't out here so I'm very confused
