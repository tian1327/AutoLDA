 hi guys welcome back to the channel I wanted to talk about where this came from and first I wanted to show you guys what I did yesterday yesterday we ended up having pizza Friday I had to ride the bike to go get this delivery bag put the pie in the bag you're trying to hold it and I'm like I kind of wrapped it first I was holding it then I kind of wrapped it around my arm and I held it under Sun housewives I found no hands and I almost fall off the damn bike that's a car company on the pizza kinda like that's much with the cardboard but we ate it was finals good pizza whatnot and shout out the Screamers pizzeria hopefully they start delivering in our zone when we move out of our current zone anyway on after that on to today what I just got done today in this vlog today in this vlog not today your time woke up this morning and I had to go shoot a segment for for my music video that I'm not mine but a music video that I'm working on and it's a project that I'm doing wait law of P you guys are familiar with him because of the last vlog that's why I was shooting a scene with there in the last vlog in and in this vlog I shot in another scene too and it goes with the story of what we're doing obviously I didn't show you guys too much of it and yeah that's because of the visual aspect of what we're creating so he bit more secret and you guys will see it when the project is complete and then after that I found out from him that you know that there was gonna be a protest so at 3 o'clock wasn't sure I was gonna do it because I know I had to go deliver a package so I went and delivered the Hat that was ordered one of multiple hats that I dropped off today and yeah I dropped off the hats to the only because USPS for local I just didn't want to do it because it was like wasting money because it's gonna take longer than what I can actually do so she's like you know what so I could make it quicker I could deliver it on my own so I was out there delivering it on my own for you guys and hopefully you know everyone appreciate the fact that you know it was coming quick and yeah I'm just trying to make my customers happy after I did that I ended up coming back home I grabbed some vegan Jamaican food from this place called then vendors then I'm gonna put the name on the screen and the address or in the description you guys can see it there is a really nice spot you know if you're in the New York area you can go there is our flatland it's a dope spot and you could get your juices you know juice press it smoothies and all of that stuff health conscious everything is near is vegan you don't have to question it and they don't really mess with soy potato rice and peas and Rasta pasta and then fried this fried oysters they call it but it's mushroom and it's fried like and it tastes like escovitch fish if I used to when I used to eat fish escovitch fish it's like you know that you're making thing to find and I don't know how to got to get the onions and the peppers to taste that way but it got this nice taste and it is exactly like it so we went in you know the kids obviously enjoyed the meal too and yeah once I got back I was actually making a decision in my mind like you know am I going back to go do you know just to go to the protest and you know support and you know be around you know my brothers and sisters are one I know my wife can't go cuz you know somebody that care for our child so at the end of the day I finally after we ate and I done took a shower I made the decision I'm on my way to a protest and ya gotta make it culture all right peek at those you know  it's crazy      one incident we're saying that you know we were riding I won now but I feel like we weren't it was nice and peaceful you know even though it was like profanity being used I felt like it was a peaceful protest thus far no no drama no yelling no screaming no fighting the cops or anything like that cause of me my looting or anything like that anything anything of that nature we were it was a positive crowd where we were just being expressive and yeah thus far who was smooth on our end New Jersey I see people and on like photographers that I follow on Instagram I see them posting you know the areas you know in Jersey and as well as you know some areas in Atlanta Elaine stuff like that where the chaos is happening but in all reality they're seeing that it's not black people that are doing it so you know yeah so but we're getting blamed for me but um on that note um you know rest in peace - George I wanna I don't know if Krishna have anything to say about this topic so I'm gonna bring her hey babe you got any desi about the George thing take a seat that I wanted to post I didn't post it yet well see cuz oh I'll just mention also like last night my friend she called me like I like that I think I got 12 o'clock like 11:55 and we had this long discussion week I got off the phone I got closer two o'clock in the morning and we were talking about like she doesn't agree with the writing and stuff like that and I get it I get her side and I was just like is that a butterfly no I thought the same thing I think it's a month and I was just like you know like I agree with it which is kind of shocking right you would think that I would have used it but I agree with it because we got to think about it as if he was one of our like person that look I don't wanna call any one thing like if he was one of our persons that belonged to us like he was a family member right or if he was us like like us as an individual he is us it's not like he is because he's black and he was just tree like an animal and just keeps happening and happening happening and I'll say they don't listen like they don't listen to us they don't they haven't tried to like bring justice to these cops that are just taking our lives like that so this is the only way for them to listen and I was literally just watching them like I literally got off a movie I was watching and then he wanted news and they're talking about all the stuff that's happening right or the protests or whatever but the riots is not even cause blah blah but listen so the guys like also how is out there how the protests whatever whatever and all the interviews are white white people and it's like all the white people and they're like oh yeah you know I see people doing stuff and doing this and this and this okay boy the way other people of color that that are protesting that are being you know the narrative is always like we're like this you know what I mean and okay cool like obviously we protest peacefully nothing happened now we're post testing in a chaotic way and now like well either way you'd still think that we were crazy and we're doing ridiculous things and we don't care about the country whatever whatever fine then let that be what you guys think because obviously it don't matter what what we do you will always think of us like that and so my friend had said that she I don't want to give too much of what she said because you know one thing that she said that really stuck to me even though we have disagreeing she's she kept saying well I'm gonna just disagree disagree and I was like it doesn't matter like you don't need to disagree we don't need to disagree to disagree because you just need to understand that even though you don't agree with what's happening the riots and stuff like that not are not caused by us they're not caused by us we still have a right to do it because they don't care it don't matter if the buildings are in our neighborhoods it don't matter if it's not in our neighborhoods because you know why if we're not here to have these things in our neighborhood it don't matter if our people are being killed to enjoy these things on it don't matter like it really doesn't matter it's not taking away jobs from and any of us because if it was happening if they blew up like it on like a like a 5th Avenue or whatever right like either way those people who worked at Fifth Avenue you don't think if they were white they'll be replacing the people who maybe live in I think at the gateway Target or whatever you know what I mean like we are disposable so what does it matter it doesn't really matter unless things change and then she um she had said she said like I wrote it what happened so she has said she has said this is what she said to me she um well she said this is her meeting sorry she said raise your children if you if you're a dear white person right you want to help the cause I don't think that I should be giving you advice on how to help the cause as a human being you should understand that we are people I get it I get it but we are people and if at this point in your life we have to tell you how to treat people how to raise your children to treat other black children because in the future they are going to be adults together they are the ones who are going to view our black children as dangerous or you know or on or suspicious then your purpose is it doesn't it'sit's like you asking it doesn't really matter like because if it's not ingrained in you that we're human beings that we should just be automatically just being looked at the same then it's like it's like what's the point you know but she has that um yeah raise your children to see my children as human beings so the so in the future racism all exist and it's definitely true it definitely does start from home it definitely does start if you want to help raise your your child that's going to pre-k with my kid to see us to see my child as a human being because if you are doing things that are not if you're saying things that are bashing a person because of their ethnicity of their culture of their skin color your child will pick that up so that's where it went naturally because they learn habits we teach them habits you know that's how that's how they learn so if you if you start you want to help you if you start there then that's how you can help because other than that I have no advice I have no advice but yeah I'm very passionate about this and it's like it's crazy because I it's hard it's hard to articulate like we're in the moment right now so in a little vlog cuz she look like she's gonna continue you guys want to hear more about our side about the whole situation about us being black in America I'm nervous whenever I see something I'll see someone in uniform if you're not know people on the force and I know I don't have anything on my record and I know it's just bogus oh stop signing how to be at least nice profile and I was like oh man I don't wear do rags in the street I don't do nothing crazy because of my dad yes there's more to it so if you guys want to know more on this topic then you know yourself in the comments you know and then we'll talk more we're not afraid to talk about anything so
