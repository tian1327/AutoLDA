  get in the car get ready to go you just had a bomb so we are flying out of Nashville instead of months ago because the flights each were like two hundred dollars cheaper so an hour and a half drive and here we are take it a little flight and there's Skyler just take it a nap but he woke up after we checked in I did take one suitcase for me in him one carry-on one small bag that we checked with like his medicine and things like that image and toiletries and then we did have a car seat and we're gonna check the stroller at the gate so on this trip it's my mom my dad and my sister my brother and my brother's girlfriend Lexus so it's my sister's 25th birthday and we're turning up in New York on a little family vacay so this is me Haley and sky getting ready to board our flight so a tip that I picked up from other Mahmood's on YouTube was to feed my baby when taking off and landing so well this helps tell me you're popping a noise like that and we're in New York for more tips and traveling do's and don'ts with your baby make sure you're on the lookout for my next video which will be totally about packing and traveling with a baby so make sure you subscribe to my channel and like this video  no they have a train oh they tried to build the monorail that's the hard crust with processed mozzarella marinara  well we look very close to mama very particular now excuse me because I was dealing with the baby but this is footage from my brother of our Airbnb there was a four-bedroom two-bathroom Airbnb in Brooklyn it was about fifteen hundred dollars cheaper than looking a hotel so obviously for what we got it was very nice it's pretty spacious for in New York Airbnb we thought so that's like the room with the bunk beds because it was just me a scholar    give you any good reason that's what I said this is a Batman movie the villains really off the poster don't think that it literally is a plot for Batman I'm saying you know what the government said everything is in control don't panic  so for lunch we went to Carmine's it's an Italian restaurant in Times Square and it was incredible the food was incredible it's family style so we just ordered a salad and two main dishes and we shared it and it was plenty of food so we had a good time at Carmine's and we would definitely recommend you stop there in Times Square so we're out in Times Square we're just here to explore really we don't have anything specific that we want to see in Times Square the Broadway shows were canceled last night so we didn't get to go to our Broadway show but we're just here to explore and see what else New York has to offer us so the shows were cancelled due to the coronavirus or covet 19 I think is the official name for it also a lot of museums and other tourist attractions are also being cancelled I mean everything's changing within 24 hours so you know we're just trying to see what we can do basically because we here in New York we not leaving so we want to have a good time and you know just enjoy this vacation  I was wrong there try at least seven times and I will be finished so after walking the wrong way for like 30 minutes we finally found madam two things I think that's how you say it the wax museum so we're gonna go in and try to get tickets this is one of the few things that is open also Ripley believe it or not as something but we just decided to go in here cuz you know it's camera friendly so the tickets ended up being like $45 a piece which is pretty steep but considering Methodist is open I mean I guess it's worth it so yes like ten people in here though we having a good time daddy over here dancing with these photos licks is trying to get him on camera he got Skyy pretending to flirt with this lady Ryan back there looking at Kim K and I don't know where her mama and Haley had but they somewhere around here there they go me and Ryan and Skylar taking a picture I set the damn picture the wrong email oh I'm sorry about it  I don't know why I have never seen ghostbusters I feel like I need to watch it but I also kind of feel like it's a little late at this point yeah the staff is Stardust are all aspiring to be on Broadway    so today is March 14th it is my sister's 25th birthday so happy birthday Hayley we are at brunch at the buttermilk channel which is on the list of top Brooklyn places to have brunch and it was a treat so me and Ryan had the pork chop and cheddar waffles which was amazing several people had the pancakes we had biscuits eggs bacon it was an incredible brunch we really really enjoyed it and highly recommend going to the buttermilk channel for brunch so here we are at Macy's which is a whopping nine floors and covers several blocks so as you can imagine it was extremely overwhelming and you know the money was burning a hole in our pocket so here we are just shopping along  so we did take our chances and caught a lift over to the 9/11 memorial it is closed because of Corona again or our Cove at 19 whatever you want to call it but as you can see it is roped off where you can't even get up close and there are actually security guards out here patrolling to make sure that you get nowhere near the pools and as you can see they're not even turned on as i zoom in here you can see the fountains are not even on so it's still a very surreal feeling just being here and knowing that so many people lost their lives here and it's just a you know a real moment in US history that comes to life when you get here  as you can see there are very few people even anywhere near this area here is the mall and these are supposedly shaped to resemble how the metal was bit when the towers fell so I thought that was amazing such a beautiful piece of artwork all the graffiti this is just so beautiful   so we did end up changing our flights to go home one day early but before we go we did go to a birthday dinner for my sister at Chadwicks which was an incredible steak house and we did also go to 235th which is a rooftop bar and it was such an amazing view such a good time and the igloos were still out but we couldn't go in and because of Corona so oh yeah it was a great trip for more of my travel adventures make sure you subscribe to my channel and like this video see you later honey
