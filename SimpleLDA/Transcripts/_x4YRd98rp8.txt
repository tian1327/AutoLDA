 so I'm just creeping up my hair right now it is Friday May 29 and it's 859 a.m. I haven't crapped my hair in a while and I really wanted to do it today I don't know why for some reason I just was in the mood when I got this crimper on Amazon for like $20 it's so cheap and so good so I'll link this down below for you guys but yeah I'm just getting ready right now I woke up at 6:30 you went for a walk get some vitamin D and just move my body a little bit I also got a new shampoo conditioner than loving I think it's making my hair look so good lately this is not but my friend Caitlin took me to get it and I got the pure ology shampoo and conditioner I'll show it to you this is the one that I got and I absolutely love it it's make my hair just so much more like volumize and it just feels so good lately so I got the UM my hair it looks insane right now I'm sorry I'm not done with it so this is the one that I got and it says it's for Pierre native density and texture and it looks and feels like more hair which I totally think is true because my hair has been feeling a lot thicker and I also got on the conditioner but they smell so good and I'm super excited about it doing my makeup now I wanted to give you guys a quick rundown so I use the it cosmetics CC cream all over my face and the Laura Mercier concealer and hoping Sephora's open today because I need to get some new products and then I'm just taking my Marc Jacobs bronzer putting bronzer on and then I'll just do like my brows and a little bit of eye shadow and then I also filmed my everyday Quarantine makeup Dean kind of what I do quick I'm doing a little bit more today in that video I got my eyebrows micro bleeded so it's really not hard for me to follow our like figure out the shape because I have like exactly what to do I just do my brows to make them a little bit darker and more filled in looking so it's super fast so I highly recommend a your eyebrows microwave and it was life-changing for me I'm gonna do a little bit of a pink eyeshadow today I've been using the Tarte blush in the shade part a I've been loving blush lately I just think it looks so pretty and cute and since of doing like more pink eyeshadow I want blush on so one of my favorite eyelash tricks is to heat your eyelash curler with a hairdryer and then check it like this to make sure it's not too hot but I feel like this works really well for me cuz like when you think about it you're using like a straightener or crimper or whatever to do your hair so I feel like it kind of works the same for eyelashes and you can see the before or not so like this is curled obviously and then this is without doing it but I feel like it makes a difference well I got ready so I feel like I can give you guys a proper intro now what's up

the driveway now so I want to give you guys a little haul of everything that I got I ran into Walgreens and there was like not really anything that I wanted so I didn't get anything there but I have Sephora and hopefully show you so we'll start with Sephora I thought quite a few things just because like I haven't gotten anything in a while and I really needed some new makeup products so I got the Becca highlighter this is in the shade champagne pop and this is my absolute favorite highlighter is so beautiful on and then I also got the NARS blush in the shade orgasm I've heard so many good things about this but I've never tried it so I'm super excited I know it's just like a really beautiful like pink shimmery color and then I also got the Laura Mercier concealer this is in the shade 1w and I absolutely love this concealer mine is run out I've used already like two full ones of these before so this is my go-to then I also got the Born This Way concealer but I got this in the shade butterscotch so I'm going to use this for contour I actually had this one before too but I ran out and I get the mini size just because I feel like the big one will just last so long and I don't really need that like I don't need spend the money on it so just get the mini one and then I also got the famous lip combo that everyone is talking about from Charlotte Tilbury it is the it pillow talk so I got the lip stick and then the lip liner so I'm super excited about this everyone has been talking about it and I've been really wanting to try it so super super excited about this and then I also got a new Beauty Blender and I got the tan one because they do have like a pink and a black and they have like this new one that like changes colors but honestly like once you put makeup on it it just gets brown anyway so I was like I might as well just get the tan and then the last thing that I got is this drawer or Joey I don't know how to say it but I got it in this shade rich ginger so that I could also use this for contouring I've seen some people do it on Instagram so try this out as well that is everything that I got at Sephora it's getting so hot in my car okay and then I also went to Whole Foods I have a lot of groceries so I really didn't need to pick up like that many things but there are a few so I'll just show it to you so I got the microgreens I love this on our becau toe toes it's so good and they've been out of it for a while so I'm super excited that they had this available and then I got my favorite yogurt this is by Kate Hill I love the KL one in the forager one but this one was on sale so I got this it is the unsweetened planed all unsweetened plain almond milk yogurt and then my favorite bread this is by the brand food for life is the gluten-free brown rice bread and then I also got their English and muffins which are super good they're already melting I need to put this in the freezer quick but these are the multi seed English muffins and then the bread is so good for avocado toast a lot of people like the blue package too but can literally never find that one in stock so I always get the red package and then I got some more fruit for the mornings for today and so I got this ginormous pack of strawberries I love it the Driskill fruit I don't know why but like I feel like this brand of fruit is just so good all of its like just amazing so I got a big thing of strawberries and then blackberries and then the last thing I got is more kombucha they were having a sale of two for five dollars so I got four and I love having kombucha at night and wine glass you guys know if you guys have seen my channel before but if this is your first video I have half a bottle of kombucha and a wine glass like every night it's so good so I got the Rose Barry I've never tried this one so I'm super excited to try this kind and then I also got the triology one I've never tried this one either so got two new flavors and then two flavors that are already three which is the lemonade one this one's like really good it's just kind of like a subtle drink I like it just 32 and refreshing and then the last one I got which is my all-time faves a graphic artist and I tried this one with Camilla in my Seattle vlog if you guys haven't seen that go check it out I had her try it for the first time and you guys can see her reaction to it but yeah so these are really good and they're on sale which is amazing but everything that I got at the store so hope you guys enjoyed that little haul of the grocery store and Sephora but yeah I'm gonna go put this all in the fridge now so I'm just making my avocado toast right now and this is one of my favorite things to eat I obviously showed you guys the bread that I use in hopefully tall and then I'm just gonna put the micro greens on top but I made the avocado so I just did half of an avocado and then lemon juice pink Himalayan salt and pepper so I'm just waiting for the bread to be done toasting this is like one of my favorite things to eat and I am one of those people that will just eat the same thing over and over again because I like it I like to toast my toast twice because I feel like I like it a little bit crunch here and like more toasted and this one takes like a long time to toast I feel like right so the bread is toasted  so just spread all this around obviously this is like the most basic thing so I don't know why I'm like really explaining it so I think the key to making this avocado toast so good is this everything but the bagel seasoning from Trader Joe's it is life-changing you can put it on so many different like toast things you put on eggs I just am obsessed with this seasoning so if you don't know about it you need to try it so good so I just dumped this all over and then I'll just do a little bit of microgreens here is the finished avvocato toast and it looks so good so good you guys but I have an idea I was thinking you guys could comment down below what you guys could eat every single day and not get sick of it or just like your favorite food so I can get some good ideas of like what else I could eat or maybe do some things to try so yeah comment down below favorite food or like something you could eat every single day and not get sick of it because I'm just so curious okay you guys are just gonna be angling on my bed I just got in the door and there's a package so I really want to open it oh it's my phone cases from case app this is such a cute case look at this oh my gosh I'm obsessed little rainbows oh my gosh I love them I got a plain white one and then I also got this one with like peaches on it which is really really cute alright guys I have changed into my workout set and I'm gonna do a workout top is from Lulu and so are the bottoms I think I've shown this in a video before I don't really remember but I do have some people that have asked me how I stay consistent with working out and I would say that one of the things that I do that really helps me is to work out at the same time every day so I work out from 5:00 to 6:00 every day I don't I mean I guess not every single day but like majority of the days and I set aside this time because this is just a time block that works well for me it's not a motivation thing it's like a dedication thing and this is what needs to be done during that time of the day and so this is something that I've been doing especially during the quarantine that's really helped me really recommend trying to like pick an hour block during the day that that's like the time that you work out and you don't do anything else all right guys so I finished with my workout I just did one of Whitney Simmons full-body circuits and then I also did the elliptical for 20 minutes and just watching YouTube video I was on it so I was good so I'm pretty exhausted I'm probably gonna take a shower and like rinse off and everything and then I'll make some dinner so yesterday I went to Target and I got this new flamingo razor and it's in this like really pretty color it's kinda hard to see on camera and rose gold but TMI I really need to shave my armpits but what's really cool is it hangs in your shower here it is I think it's so cute and so easy to take off and on so that's so fun just got out of the shower and my armpits are looking a little nice I really like that razor I can get it works really well and I love that it hangs on the shower so that is exciting but it's almost 7:00 and I'm getting a little hungry so I'm gonna head to the kitchen make some dinner also if you're wondering I switched my Apple watch band cuz I'm wearing black now and I just wanted it to match so for dinner I made some veggies there is zucchini yellow pepper red onion mushrooms and garbanzo beans and then I'm making this pea protein patty from Trader Joe's so I'm going to eat dinner outside but here is all the veggies cooked up but YUM and then I'm think I'm going to top it with a little bit of coconut aminos so in my room now and I have my kibou chit in a wine glass and you guys saw that I bought the triology one and the verdict is it's not my favorite I'm not gonna lie I really don't like ginger that much so it's just not my favorite one it's fine I'll still drink it but I just I don't know I just don't really like genders I know it's good for you so I'm still gonna drink it but yeah I'm probably just not gonna buy this one again I didn't look at this ingredients on the back I probably should have read what was in it before I even like bought it but I bought it and then I poured it and then I went into my room and then I tried it and I was like oh there's definitely ginger in here so yeah it's not my favorite thing but it's okay I just won't buy that one again but also can we take a moment like isn't my hair looking so much more like volumize and like I don't know fluffy from that shampoo whoa I literally love it I think it's a really good shampoo conditioner by the brand pure ology so yeah super happy with how my hair is I'm just gonna hang out what maybe watch a show or something I could I just want to like chill I need to like relax when I was at Target I also got two new toothpaste I called my dentist and they said to use the gum and sensitivity one in the evenings and then to use this Colgate optic white one for whitening in the mornings so I'm going to try them out I'm gonna try this one tonight and then the other one in the morning I'm not gonna lie that toothpaste was actually really good it was just like a really good mint but I have been listening to the skinny confidential I love their podcasts and listen to them usually when I walk in the mornings and one of them have a lot of good information about oral health and so that's kind of what inspired me to get new toothpaste but yeah I really like the night one so far so my trip it's excited to try the one that I got from morning tomorrow but yeah enough on that I'm gonna close out
