 good morning today is Monday June 1st and I'm in Soho right now a few weeks ago I made you a video where I took you around New York in my bike and I thought I would go even more downtown today and it is week number 12 of stay at home lockdown order and it looks like it's the last week I mean we opening next week and next Monday they say it's going to be phase 1 so I really wanted to see what empty streets look like even though it's definitely more lively than a few weeks ago but I definitely want to see Soho without the businesses open so I'll take you around in the bike ride and I hope you enjoy it so I'm still working through Soho right now as I expected I knew a lot of storefronts will be damaged following the protests that have been happening for the last four days which is you know not a surprise its kind of hurt you know to see Soho so damaged you see a lot of store fronts that have been completely opened and things have been stolen and clothes on the floor well it's a huge mess yeah and it's as you can see behind me it doesn't stop a lot of storefronts are trying to protect themselves a lot of people are putting some woods because we know it's not going to stop and it shouldn't stop like people should be allowed to protest I'm not gonna go into what's happening right now I think the news are you know covering it a lot and yeah it's definitely a weird atmosphere because I knew Soho would not be completely you know shut down and people are in the streets but yeah it's not peaceful you know like you know that the world is hurting right now yeah so let's let's keep going  so I've arrived in Chinatown finally I miss Chinatown I love coming down here and up some food it is definitely livelier than what I expected there are more people and I didn't think about that but that makes sense because it's mostly restaurants so they are open to take out a lot of like fresh fruits and vegetables and fish so yeah it's not that surprising actually that everything is reopened but yeah people are just like yeah grocery shopping like a normal day of course they're wearing masks but yeah it feels good to see a little bit more of life in the neighborhood next I'll go to Little Italy and I'm expecting it to not be as crowded as it is here which is going to be very weird because I've never seen Little Italy without a tourist so let's go check it out  I'm in front of cha-cha matcha which is where my love for morality started and it is clothes unfortunately I would have gotten one but yeah so I am walking down between Little Italy in Chinatown and he's crazy because Janet and everything is open yeah it's funny how you go from one suite to the next and the atmosphere is completely different so I'm gonna keep walking and see what literally is life  so I mean Little Italy right now and holy cannoli it's empty it's really weird I've never seen Little Italy Chinatown like this I mean Chinatown is bit more lively but yeah literally is definitely empty empty empty a few people are in front there trying to protect the stores the windows right now so they're trying to put some woods up most of them are open for take-out although now you know what a lot of them are still closed but you know that's life it's going to be reopen soon yeah it's definitely more like a log down feel and it'll it'll even it was in Chinatown so yeah I'll keep walking let's do it  today thank you for coming along I hope you enjoyed this video and you know it gives you a little bit of a preview of what New York looks like we are referring reopening next week so it's going to change but it was definitely interesting to see and just like how different it can be from one street to the other one neighborhood to the other which is a part of what I love New York I'm not gonna lie I think the hardest part for me was not going into a Chinese restaurant and getting the yam food because that's definitely one of my favorite places to eat in New York and also Little Italy was yeah my favorite Italian restaurant was there too and it was open for take-out and that witness I brought me so many memories of last summer when I was there with my family with my friends and which was celebrated yeah I cannot wait for life to go back to a sort of normal in New York because it feels when you are knocked down it doesn't feel worth it to be here and it feels like it's you know taking away from you and the energy is definitely different I know that right now it's a sensitive atmosphere because of all the protests are all going on and people are getting ready but also very worried of what's gonna happen but I'm not gonna go too much into details into this but I definitely hope you enjoy this video thank you for watching and again subscribe to the channel like comment share you know whenever you want to comment and give me what you thought I really appreciate them because it makes me feel like I'm recording a video and somebody is watching so thank you and  you
