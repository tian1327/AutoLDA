 I saw 3m a link to our new safety video but I'm gonna make some cookies right now hey guys welcome back to the daily departure if you are new here I am a chicago-based flight attendant and I make videos with all things blood Tennant life travel life as well as lifestyle if you are new here before we get started make sure to subscribe and also hit the bell so you get notifications when I am posting new videos I'm not currently at traveling right now I am chilling at home and I am also taking a three-month leave so I'm going to have plenty of free time to be working on more of the lifestyle videos that I have on my channel which I'm super excited about I am just vlogging today what I'm doing throat this Saturday I just woke up and got ready today because I'm possibly going to be filming a video I have been working on and that is in the works I am in the process of editing my apartment tour video because first of all I love watching other people's apartment videos I love seeing where they live what neighborhood how much they pay how they decorate it and I think my sister and I have done a pretty good job of decorating this apartment so I just wanted to showcase that especially because I live in the wonderful city of Chicago and our apartment is awesome but other than that I saw last night at like 3 a.m. I went to bed super late last night because we kind of got in like a vortex of all these great movies on every streaming network that we have so we were binging movies last night but that's besides the point I saw at 3 a.m. a link to our new safety video so I sent it to my friends but this morning the video no longer is posted on there because I know one of the girls who is in the video so that's why I kind of set it out to be like hey girl it's your moment to debut on you know the safety video but it's not up anymore and I was reading some of the comments that she had screenshotted about it it's kind of funny as well as I've heard some flight attendants comments on it so far as well I kind of am bummed that it's down because you know I won't be flying for the next two months so I won't know when they officially release it unless obviously I hear through my you know flight attendants I know that are still out there flying like hey guys safety video is out now yeah it's it's quite interesting and I know we've been waiting for this for a while I personally love the safety video that we have right now with our old uniforms I know we've had it for years so people are like we're ready for a new one but that one will always be so special in my heart because first of all it's when I've been watching for the past you know three years of flying and I think it was such a great production I just think it's really cute and it's totally my aesthetic with like how simple it is so I really like that but you know time to change and we got new uniforms so we got to showcase those as well yeah I'm bummed that the link is taken down now because you know it was up for a second and everyone got their little glimpse of it but now it is down also today I think I'm going to be making some chocolate chip cookies because it's something we've been making during the quarantine and my sister's obsessed with them as well as me these are ones I've been making for a couple years now and I love this recipe they are so good they're so addicting and they're just so good and then it's Saturday so every Saturday for the past couple weeks my sister and I have been doing tea parties and I know that it's like so random but she's got a really cute tea set and we love tea so it was just kind of our time to sit down and hang out eat some snacks and drink some tea and you know enjoy some time together because it's quarantine so what else can you do if you can't go out to restaurants and cafes you might as well have one in your own home I'm gonna get today started by cleaning up everything we have left out last night because we went to bed so late we're like we're not gonna clean we'll just let it sit so bad habit I know but it's quarantine so anything goes so I just finished filming my audio and whatnot for my apartment tour I have been working on this video for a while and finally had time to sit down and do it but I'm gonna make some cookies right now and I think I mentioned that earlier before I started filming my video cuz it took like an hour and a half or so I got out the butter and measured it out already because the tip to baking chocolate-chip cookies is that you want to have your butter room temperature if it's too cold like start out the fridge it's gonna be more like a pastry that's crunchy and you're gonna have a lot more crunch to it you also don't want to melt your butter because it's going to make your cookies too soft you want this yeah too soft and lose their structure my sisters thank you but but yeah you want to make sure that your butter is room temperature and the same goes for eggs and a lot of recipes you want them room temperature so we're gonna make some chocolate chip cookies and then we're gonna set up for our tea party later  look at how good these cookies look my sister already ate that one and I have to do a sneak of these cookies because look at that oh so good look at the inside of these and how delicious they look these are my favorite cookie recipe forever she's getting it all ready with these little it's our placemats they're pretty cute and lemons we're going all out and then we're gonna have my mom and grandma and my sister join in we have matching Lilly Pulitzer things got a jumpsuit she's got a dress and then we have all of our table decor I know we're so extra but you know you gotta keep yourself entertained during quarantine these are our little Japanese tea dishes so the passion fruit meat in here right now oops can grab that okay yes so much cheese and jelly and has some carrots this was literally so strong just like how dark it is mm-hmm  you did so strong - I think you could steep it for like 30 seconds try it  Sultan one mm-hmm these are vegan cookies also so delicious they look no that would be cute that needs to up our upper level I think okay their points max I'm the coach now watching me one world together at home special for covin 19 and I just turned it on maybe 5 10 minutes ago or so and they're finally doing some music things right now John Legend and Sam Smith are singing so I don't know I just kind of figured it would be fun to join in and with some some of these concerts while I'm editing some videos to be part of this world history moment where they do a live concert in the midst of kovin 19 started streaming oh okay I am Wow I'm super late into this okay so it started streaming seven hours ago I guess let's see Jennifer Hudson John Legend okay Oh Billie Joe Armstrong okay I guess it started like seven hours ago this YouTube thing says but yeah wow they really were streaming seven hours ago I don't know how I just decided to start watching this right now but it looks like I missed a lot of artists there's like quite the lineup of here I'm bummed I missed the killers which is really good Kashyap was on it Jessie J I guess I said Jessie J was supposed to be on it for this hour but I have only seen so far Billie Joe Armstrong and John Legend and I think who else was on it J Lo comment down below if you guys also watched it and who you liked watching the singing on this but I think I'm gonna sit and watch this for a while because my sister is on the phone with one of her best friends and I am working on editing videos was she the one that I filmed yesterday and today I want to get those knocked out of the park so I can get them posted maybe by the end of this it is Saturday mid next week I guess I was kids the end of the week but I guess I don't realize that it is still Saturday Wow okay literally have no idea what day it is I think we're gonna work out later and have some dinner so I hope your guys's day is going well maybe it's morning when you're watching this maybe it's nighttime when you're watching this who knows maybe you were like me and you have absolutely zero scheduled going on you just do things as they happen I have to search and find a cardio video to do PopSugar has had some really good ones we've liked doing so probably will do one of those I'm gonna mute this just so it's not in the background but I think we're gonna do one of those if we can find one that we liked we did one two days ago that I didn't really love it was very jumpy around and it was fun dance but she didn't really teach the dance before just going ahead and doing the steps and for me I'm not a dancer so it was very hard for me but I still was definitely sweating a lot yesterday we were absolutely wrecked with our leg day that we did I was I was shaking my legs for a Saussure afterwards and yeah it was a good workout though it's always nice to feel like you got a good workout in especially cuz I just been working out from home for the past week so no like intense equipment or anything just basically like yoga mat cardio things with your body and some weights that we have here my sister is still on the phone and it's 10:15 right now so who knows if we actually work out tonight but I am going to sign off from this vlog today I know we really didn't do much
