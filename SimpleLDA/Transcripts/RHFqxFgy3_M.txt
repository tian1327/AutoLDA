 hi guys it's alex from odbc I'm just down the unit today it's gonna be the first they didn't receive vlog so we'll see how this goes no II down from landed media but we have got trusty GoPro so we'll see how this guys first things first I want to talk about is what we're doing we're currently closed for balloting detailing PPF but we are taking deposits for those jobs and we're also online for product which to be fair boost they'd like nothing else which is really really cool and certainly appreciate the the support in these times we're also supporting the staff as much as possible so if we can get staff who predominately do more of a on hands job detailing balloting job or anything like that if we can push any online work that's always great or potentially looking into zoom training calls or anything like that also working super hard on the system making sure our customer service as high as possible and keeping clients communicate just like nothing's kind of happening here and pretending that this pandemic isn't happening is important we're not going to stop communicating with clients when the times like this communication is really important we're also probably one of the most exciting things we've got something to reveal once this is all closed and it's all about the customer experience it's gonna be super super cool when customers come through here and they normally get all their fancy kind of iPads and bits we're taking up a level or dream and kind of thrive every day is to have one of the best collection experiences and taking the detail out of detailing and actually making it more of a service whilst they're offering the highest quality service that we can and we we we know that the service is there and we continue to adapt and develop into that but if we can really build on the experience as well that's that's something that we want to do down here at ABC so that's obviously staff and our closure and what we're doing at the moment other things we've got products v2 really really excited to show you those so we'll head upstairs now and we'll check those out we've got the new labels and we've also got 400 new bottles and a few other little bit so yeah we'll shoot up there so we're now upstairs and obviously looking we're more in the kind of light distribution facility as such we've got news on that as well we're no longer using AWC as distribution we've got a separate facility and unit now that we're working with someone else for distribution which means that you guys as clients are going to get faster delivery you're going to get a better kind of customer service point of view and generally everything is going to make sure it goes out on time and like we said faster delivery so we'll quickly go into this what we've got here this is the new v2 snow foam we've got the wheel clean up AWC brushes shampoo and also glass cleaner so keeping everything nice and simple making sure that it's just the maintenance range and we're not gonna go into things are waxing or anything like that and as we come across here this is the new AWC snow foam stickers so it's really exciting to get these into this is the first one that I've done and yeah really really tough of it it's been like a bit of a marketing change recently and we're just trying to change branding to a bit of a more of an orange style so that everything goes instead of the original red and black scheme so really really excited to get these up and to get them launch lights over the new distribution as well online is going to be quicker and faster and more efficient and we are gonna work on an in-store shop which is called for guys local Essex and South End or anything like that if you're any calculating questions drop me a call my number zero seven nine two five four nine eight two four nine or potentially drop me an email and myself or one of the team will get back to you so it's info AWC car detailing coat at UK and yet really really excited to get this v2 launched and kind of on the road and obviously get the shop running and everything like that so we look forward to working on more cars when we're back open again fingers crossed it won't be too long and we'll see we may even get another blog style video in there so thanks again guys and we'll speak soon
