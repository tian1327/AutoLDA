 good morning welcome back to my channel okay this is a challenge I'm doing for myself I'm going to vlog today it is Wednesday April 22nd I think I have a calendar behind me but nothing's on it because I he raced it all because I don't have anything to do so I'm going to vlog today edit this video and put it up tonight can I do it I don't know we'll see um I have a lot of things to do I have to clean up my kitchen clean up my living room I have to plants I need to repot their little tiny cactus which I might do it outside on my not it looks like it might start to rain I'm not sure yeah that's pretty much what I have to do and then I might want to do some other things I don't know this is this is like a day in the life of quarantine and what I've just been doing pretty much every day so yeah I'm gonna take you along with me let's get started Mia thinks your plants rotting Oh No yeah it looks like it yeah it's all falling apart Mia shoot its dad dad I guess luck it didn't work but these are looking good what's your little girl light no they look okay well I mean they're the bottom ones right as long as there's new growth up top they're all watery and then the other one this one was all dry at the bottom and the top and then these leaves are falling off new water that plant I like to give me dog these hugs you're poaching yeah so they're gonna just kind of hang out they go out at what time do you guys go out 8:30 they go out at 8:30 you said what now actually yeah it is about the time I take my I usually wait till noon oh okay we're gonna go outside the body um that's not what you're supposed to do get up here can you sit on me through look at these stairs guys these really need to be painted and I need no shoes so he always likes to sit in front of her because he's dominant and he doesn't give her any space sit down jazzy sit stay so we have a tree out back and squirrels like to kind of hang out up there and they like to chase the squirrels so stay stay so I like to check and make sure there's no squirrels before I let them run okay go to the racks see how they go by the tree all the time so we tell them to go potty in the rocks because it's so much easier to pick up poop in the rocks and then it is in the grass and we don't want them leaving pee stains all over the grass even though our grass is really nothing special let's walk a little slower jazzy come on jazzy let's go you need to listen butter get in the house okay so this video is already all over the place this morning I made breakfast I made bacon and eggs and I already made myself coffee but I'm gonna make myself some more coffee and then I'm gonna clean up my kitchen because we have pan there then I have some oil here from the bacon grease thing to put away and then I have a sink full of dishes so we're gonna get that cleaned up love this coffee it's so good I get it from jewel it's just cold coffee I use this coffee creamer it's loaded with sugar so I wouldn't recommend it but it's really good  mmm something else thing about doing some macrame today maybe or maybe I'll play video games just gotta clean my kitchen I want to clean my kitchen bacon grease does anybody cook with this stuff yeah I just throw it out so let me know in the comments I'd like to know do you guys use bacon grease to cook I also I think I'm just gonna put these in the dishwasher  so usually the kids do the dishes but Mia has been the only child here for the past few weeks because of quarantine so I help out when I can when I feel up to it  my kids do something that's really gross when they do the dishes they clean out the strainers and in the sink like from the leftover food that was on plates and they call it the sushi of the day want to see sushi of the day it's gross  one thing I'd like to improve in this house is how much paper towel I use I do use too much paper towel I'd rather use towels it's just a preference I know it's bad but bad do as I say kids not as I do it's clean so much better yeah if anybody has any really great tea towels or like cleaning towels that actually absorb water that work really well that dry out well that don't get moldy fast comment section below y'all let me know Jesse what are you doing doing are you a little girl what do you want what do you want Jesse do you want it clean do you want a cleaner take a nap go take a nap go get in your bed they listen when they want to okay so the sinks are clean the counter is pretty clean I shall wipe down the stove I'll do it later I did make this delicious cinnamon roll cake two nights ago you guys if you want the recipe it is delicious to ask me on Instagram I will give you the recipe surprised there's that much luck I think I might put this in Tupperware this back this is my plant solution for lekha okay so now that I got that done I think I'm gonna go into my living room and clean up here's a view of some cactus this is one cactus I want to repot and then this is another one and I want to get that done at some point today oh I forgot to turn on my Ella combs humidifier guys I absolutely love this humidifier I do have the Lavoie it's similar to the little void but I actually like this one better because it is a top loader so you can take this top piece off see if I do this with one hand and like just bring in a jug of water and dump it in there without having to carry it out now it does have the handle here so you can lift it out and bring it to the sink if you want but if you're using purified water like you should be you could just bring a jug of it and just dump in it's just so heavy once you you pick it up you know then I like how it has this little piece here for essential oil which is really nice it's like a little pad you just drop some essential oil on it then you close it up and it gives a nice little fragrant mist it has a very big display screen I don't know if my camera will pick it up I think it will it's blinking a little so sorry about that this is what it is in here right now which makes sense because I just set this up two days ago has a remote let's see okay we're gonna set it for turn it on so pretty we are gonna set it for we'll do five hours and then we'll put the humidity at 70 and I don't want it max I want it to the lowest setting I only have my Alocasia regal shields in here and my monster delicioso that needs to desperately be repotted my string of heart's benefits from this a ton so does my pulpo sets in lekha so I have some cacti down here some over here and yeah I love it I just absolutely love it I like the sleekness of it the Lavoie is a little bit larger and I like how slender it is so you can really fit it pretty much anywhere and I like the big display but it's very quiet to listen like you can't really hear it I like it that's a long text I'll read that in a second okay I like to usually just check Instagram check my text messages just to kind of see if I'm behind on anything why am i holding this so close to my face I haven't showered yet quarantine quarantine life okay let's clean up this living room I just wanted to show you guys these pillows if you haven't seen them yet in any of my other videos a friend of mine Adrienne her Instagram is wallflower district and she also has an Etsy shop where she sells plants but she ordered these for me while I was out of town in Arizona and I came home to these pillowcase covers and  so one quick note well we eat dinner at that table because we don't have a dining room table so five of us eat dinner on the couch at that table we try to make sure we eat together so like the kids don't go to their room and eat we eat together I don't really think it matters if you eat in a dining room table if you eat on the floor if unlike some comfy cushions or if you eat your coffee table it doesn't really matter as long as you're together I feel like that's kind of our thing but I have to clean this table every day because it's seen better days and it gets food on it so let me just show you we try to keep it in the best condition we can but this is glass and it looks great from afar but if you get up close like from all the cleaning and then like stuff gets in the crevices and it drives me nuts and then there's like also like these crevices where like kids get like food all over the place but anyway so I'm looking for a new table that doesn't show as much yuck plus this bottom shelf here is just always constantly load it with dog hair can you see that it's not picking it up but there's dog hair all over it so again leave it in the comments section below okay seriously wow wow wow no joke just that little bit exhausts me and that's where I'm at right now I'm kind of in a space where I'm getting exhausted over little things I have not been working out I don't work out regularly either but I feel like just being home this much and not being like out working a wedding and running around all day every weekend is usually what I'm used to and that hasn't been the case I've been very lazy I've been eating like crazy and I have not been working out and I'm out of breath for little things so definitely have to change this up but is anybody else experiencing this am I the only one today's actually downstairs right now working out he works out like two hours a day every other day I envy that because I can't get in the right headspace to just do it you know good lord anyway I'm gonna finish my coffee and then I'm gonna hop in the shower and then I'm going to get to repotting so we won't record that see it a little bit does that work sure I was just I just got done brushing my hair and I wanted to show you guys what I use after I wash my hair and I absolutely love this stuff this is called milkshake it's a leave-in conditioner and it just smells so good and it leaves your hair really soft and it conditions it I have pretty dry hair because just cuz I dye it and I don't style it as often now that I'm not working I never style it but like when I go to weddings I usually just straighten it with a flat iron and that really drives my hair out so it's got pretty clean ingredients I mean the first ingredient is water but you can look it up if you want called milkshake I got it from my salon so you might not be able to get it on Amazon I don't know maybe I'm telling you this for nothing but if you know somebody in the hair industry ask them about it anywho I also want to talk about what I put on my face and I haven't done it yet so I figured I just do it with you can you hear the birds chirping I have my window open that's what I needed okay so I also sell beauty counter products if you guys don't know what beauty counter is it's a company dedicated to clean skincare and I've been doing it for about two and a half years now oh it's been that long that's kind of crazy um it just really tames my rosacea like if you can see I have rosacea and it's not fun it doesn't really affect my t-zone but just like my cheeks so I really try to use clean ingredients and by clean i mean free of toxins uncles there's a lot of in our beauty products that you may not know about that's a little Gary if you're interested I'll have a link below just to my beauty counter like if you purchase something from that link I get a little cut of it because I sell it but anyway this is called the cleansing balm and what you do is you just take a little bit of this cleansing balm it's almost like a waxy it's got like a waxy texture to it you just drop it all your feets like old face wash rub it all over your face and then you let it sit for a little bit you take a warm towel and you just wipe it off so it's not like a lathering soap kind of cleanser if you like lathery soap cleansers which it took me a while to get used to this because i used to like that um then you might not like it but it definitely leaves your face supersoft and it calms the redness down in my face so literally like that's the amount I take not a lot in this whole jar it's not the cheapest of stuff guys let me tell ya this jar I think is eighty bucks I think seventy or eighty bucks but this lasts me usually like ten months so it's not and I get a discount on it because I sell it people argue that beauty counters not an MLM I think it is I literally do nothing with it though I have nobody under me I just I I took it on more so for the discount for the products and that's why I sell it so I make enough money each month to be able to cover the costs of my products that I buy you kind of like rub it in your fingers and it gets warm and then it kind of gets like creamy you see that anywho you know it is a multi-level marketing company because sorry if you're a beauty counter rep watching this there's people underneath you you know more selling it but I won't say anything wrong with that as long as it's not like affecting people's livelihoods or the company's not over promising what they're this is a very like legit black and white company like you know what you're gonna make it's not like uh you know yeah they want you to work your way up in the company of any company would or any MLM would to but if you don't want to do it full-time you don't want people under you don't have to so i sell it just so I can you know make enough to buy the products that I need I have a couple clients under me that purchase every month they love it it's such great skin care like I literally have yet to find another company that has cleaner products the beauty counter if you're interested this is turning into a skincare video if you're interested in what like where your products that you're using now kind of level with clean or toxic you can always go to ewg org it's a website that will write your product on a scale and it'll show you like if it's bad if it's great if it's ewg approved what do each w you stand for can't remember beauty Conor has never taken up a ton of my time I went really hard into it the first couple of months got a couple of clients and I just didn't really care to expand anymore after that you don't have to if you don't want to now that I've rubbed it in my face for like how long was it a couple minutes just gonna let it sit you know go get a rag good this cleansing balm also comes with like a cloth that you can use but I like my just regular cloth butter because they're fluffier and that's it you can also use this stuff for like cuts and burns and super dry skin like if you have like eczema it's really great for that it's great for baby but rashes yes it is don't ask me how I know that the next thing I use is not beauty counter because the lotion I was using was great great but I found something cheaper that I really liked it is called ii-era organics and this is the smooth line this you can get on Amazon I'll go ahead and put a link to this in the description below it is so nice it's super thick very clean you can read all the ingredients online as you can see I think I need some more I think it was maybe 30 bucks for this jar which is not bad because the moisturizer I was using was oh I think like 40 something and it was less than this like less amount but this is daily daily redness moisturizer as you can see it says it on the bottom there wonder if smooth so this is for rosacea how crazy do I look funny so I just rub this in you want to prevent the wrinkles you know I just per met the wrinkles I am so excited to see what this video turns into okay now that we got that done let's go over cut some cacti I was gonna repot and then I realized it is already 12:38 and then it's lunchtime so I think I'm gonna make myself some food diet coke raspberry tea milk lunch juice Arizona tea yogurt interesting whoo that was meatloaf from last night mmm look it's at 5 o'clock yet I think I'm gonna do yogurt with some granola yeah let's do that so we have Ziggy's vanilla have some granola and then we have some almonds let's do it three big-ass scoops we don't measure in this house we're just gonna just gonna eyeball it like eight that's it easy does Malik yummy sometimes sometimes when I don't have granola I use cereal I just put some dry cereal and Negreanu is obviously better for you because it's oats but you know we make work with what we have mm-hmm when I'm done with this we're gonna reap ah cactus okay cool something else I want to talk about while we're all at home during this pandemic I know a lot of people are watching the news and watching like CNN and maybe Fox News I don't know but you're trying to keep up-to-date with what's happening and I do like this show it's called pandemic and right now they're they're pretty much talking about grocery store workers risking their lives to keep food on our table and I like to see stuff like that I like to see like the good that people are doing and it just helps me to appreciate you know nurses and doctors and essential workers like grocery store clerks and food delivery services and people that are cleaning all the grocery stores and essential daycare workers food pantry workers the list really goes on so I like to do that it kind of humbles me and it brings you back to a reality of you know there's always somebody that has it worse even though we're all suffering in our own way during this it really it helps me get through the day the week the months they're gonna talk about baby elephants what cheeks look a little better I need to do my eyebrows or maybe not cuz I have nowhere to go um okay hi I am going to repot these cactus but I have it pointed down so you can see it oh maybe I'll get a little closer down there so this is a really cool like concrete planter it does have a hole in the bottom you can see that I don't want to dip it cuz I'm gonna fall out but um I love this thing I can't remember where I got it from that's cute I don't know the name of this cactus if anybody knows what it is feel free to leave it in the comment section below I think I got it in Tucson if I'm not mistaken and it wasn't labeled so let me know but they do it does have spines but they're not the spines that come out so I'm not really worried about putting my gloves on and getting poked I do want to try to use the stone as like a top dress still hurts me okay we're gonna try not to touch it can it's so cute though I love it thank you I just love this shape and how perfect it looks cacti are so awesome okay this is too much a little bit in there that's cute it's a good level in the backyard some of these stones here I didn't get it that long ago I just wanted to give it some fresh soil so the roots can benefit from that and then I'll use this to top dress there we go No secure it in there that was easy I know this was gonna be an easy job so I didn't want to make it a full video suite I'm gonna give it some water that looks good doesn't it perfect okay one down one more to go now this one is a Astra fight on Asterius that's the name of it focus so that's the name and these were from eco grow in Tucson really really cute shop Becca brought me and Adam there for the first time not that long ago and I just loved it they're really great place if you're in Tucson make sure to check them out just probably like too big of a pot but I don't really care this one doesn't have any spines on it that root system look at that that looks good I can fill it a little bit again just wanted to give it some fresh soil topic this stuff sorry I'm making so much noise I'm not wearing a mic it's a little low in the pot but I don't care about that there I think we're good just toss out the rest I think that's perfect cute alright we're done I'm gonna get cleaned up okay I just cleaned everything up but as I was in there I looked at my ellic homes again and I totally forgot to tell you guys earlier that there will be a link in the description below if you guys want to pick up a telecoms humidifier and hope I'm saying that right it's not sure it is an affiliate link so if you click on that link and you go to purchase it over on Amazon you will be helping my channel by supporting my channel because I will get a tiny percentage of any purchases purchased through that link it's no extra to you though so that's nice okay now I think what I'm going to do is I think I'm going to clean up a couple of my plants I was just washing my hands and I looked over my god I'm sweating I looked over at my plants in my window and I noticed they need some grooming let me show you so this succulent I don't know if it's a jade I don't know what it is my daughter got it at Home Depot a long time ago just has some dead leaves here I think this needs to get cut off it just needs to clean up and then this aloe here has a bunch of dead leaves in there so I'm going to set my camera up and just check these out and groom them up perfect okay so it's got some fuzzies on here I don't know what these are from but there's definitely some dead pieces just kind of come in and take them off this is getting kind of leggy but like the top is so fuzzy and there's such tight little blooms at the top that I don't I think it's doing okay it isn't a window this is a north-facing window I think I'm gonna cut this piece off up here see how it's kind of dangling let me get the scissors there is a growth spot on there but maybe we can propagate that so see these fuzzies what the heck is that maybe it's like dog fuzz I don't know it's not spider mites um maybe I could propagate that I'll try okay but now I feel like this is not serving a purpose so I'm gonna chop it there and then let's see I mean these are little bruised up but I feel like they don't yeah this one could come off they're a little bruised up but not necessarily need to take those off but see how tight these like these blooms are here let me get a little closer and show you see how tight that cluster is that's how you want them to grow you don't want them to grow leggy like this you want them to be like in tight little clusters so I feel like I don't know they're still cool I want to say this is a type of a jade they branch out into like really big trees so alright I think it's better here's the aloe okay so there's just a bunch of right here really some dead leaves I'll just kind of pull out maybe you gotta cut this on you just want to get all the dead stuff out as best as you can just to avoid getting pests if too much debris falls onto the top of your soil it's just a little pest playground so you want to keep it as clean as possible and just like stuff like this you know just check your plans from time it again here okay feel like that's it put this dead stuff off because I don't like looking at it okay I mean that already looks better huh I feel like these might be good to come off but whatever they're not fully dead yet there's like little pups coming up here growing up out of there the screw-ups so wild it's crazy okay I think that that's better what does a squirrel think he's happy I'm gonna figure out how to propagate this but I think I might just cut it here and just pop it into some soil okay usually turn my humidifier on about midday I like it to go at night while I am watching TV I don't know I just find it soothing I turned this one this way and this one this way just so that these plants can benefit from it this is my Lavoie have it set at 65% but it's only 38% in here now although this says it's 42 and that it's comfortable mmm I put my plants beg to differ so I'm gonna set this to will do six hours get this humidity up in here sweet I got my little Rafa de Fora tetris Burma here this is a brand new leaf I got this from Becca Dale of plants I love it so much she's got its own Mouse pole now then my Horsehead plant which is my by Penna folium i just clean the leaves yesterday but i feel like they have humidifier residue on them oh no that's dust legit dust and i just clean these fun this is my Alocasia amazonica look it's like one leaf isn't that funny also this is very light that's why I keep it on the top here you don't want it to put anything too heavy on here cuz I could crack the base so you don't want that anyway just a little overview of my plant area here this is my IKEA shelf there's no rhyme or reason as to how I have these on here they all get the same amount of light pretty much Jace yucca tree and Little Miss fiddly fig we just put out a new leaf but I'm noticing it's got like some scarring to it and it's a brand new leave this one was the leaf before it didn't even get that big and it's got like two holes in it I'm what's up with that but this is a pretty one so I usually just go over my plants make sure they don't need anything I did this a couple days ago and they were fine so sometimes I'll go into like my lack of plants and I'll check the root system and see how we're doing that looks good kind of have like a mental note of where the roots were before when I checked them how they're doing now at that this is my monstera Eden Soni I I got from green spaces the only one left and I was able to save it literally the only plant I saved from my green space order my salted picanha is happy this whole area is backlit so I don't like to show it on camera or a lot oh and someone asked how my little pine tree my north folk pine was doing and it's doing pretty good I had it pulled pretty far away from the window but it's happy I just took the stuff out of it from the wintertime and like Christmas what are you doing did you go outside and go potty with me huh also Jay hooked up the switch in the living room you guys Mario Brothers the original that was in heaven yesterday okay just that repotting and going over my pants I'm seriously exhausted you guys this is my life maybe I'll go outside and sit in the hammock for a little bit and get some fresh air I have not been going on walks like I really wanted to our neighborhood is not a very big neighborhood we kind of live in between two busy streets and the houses are pretty close together so it's not very spread out and I just feel like the sidewalks aren't that big so I just feel like if I came across somebody else and if they weren't wearing a mask I would feel like an ass if I was like to cross the street or move away and I just I don't want to go out of my way to do that it's definitely not a reason that to go for a walk I should be going for walks we should all be going for walks but something else I wanted to update you guys on oh the last time I filmed I was talking about porch sessions because I am a wedding photographer if you're new here that's what we do and we have been out of work for the past month and a half-ish month my last wedding was March 15th in Arizona and it was my first wedding of the year in my last wedding of the year so far and we have since rescheduled a ton of weddings and I was doing porch sessions just to kind of make a little bit of extra income because we're struggling a little bit and I was told that photography is a non-essential business I understand that I definitely understand that but I didn't put two and two together and I called the Attorney General's office and I was made aware that if I am caught doing porch sessions for profit that I would be fined so I can't even earn a little bit of extra income by doing that and we drastically lowered our session rates for that like just to help families we wanted to people wanted to document this time we thought it was a good idea for families we thought it was a good idea for us as a small business to kind of get by and it turns out we can't even do that so uh you know all we can do is laugh about it we'll be okay but it's just it was kind of a bummer because I was documenting I did for porch sessions I think I got to four until I was made aware of this and I was documenting the whole thing we were going to a big thank you to all the doctors and the nurses and it was gonna be great but it's not gonna happen now little update um okay let's go to the backyard and hang out on the hammock I think me is back there actually it's raining well that sucks it's raining muhammad's getting wet Mia you know we're not going outside you know why it's raining you're gonna get all wet okay so I just hit myself straight back to the couch because it's raining outside so Mia's gonna play a game on the switch and I'm gonna watch cuz I really like to watch this game it's called hello neighbor have you guys ever heard of it it's kind of scary and it's really weird and I like it I like watching people play like fighting game not really fighting games but like suspenseful stuff like if you have to find certain clues or so I don't like playing it myself because anxiety is real but I love watching her play so let me show you a snippet of it and if you have the switch you should get it can you also play this on like different systems like Xbox and stuff they have it on Xbox that they probably have it everywhere but check it out but it's just really cool it's like it's obviously a kid game it's pg-13 I guess or it would be rated pg-13 but you pretty much have to it's like this this nosy kid is trying to mozi his way around his neighbor's house but the neighbor is really like messed up and creepy and he keeps he's keeping like secrets in the basement you have to figure out like what's down there and it's creepy I'm having a snack and it is one of Mia's breakfast bars it is 1/2 cup of honey half a cup of peanut butter in a bowl melted for like a minute and the microwave and then you like mix it up and then you add 3 cups of Cheerios and then you put them in a bar mold and then you freeze them mmm they're good cold it's good
