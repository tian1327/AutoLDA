 well I'm back and it is officially day two of this crazy crazy week that we are having um let's see how did it start well let's see how did it end so I put together day 1 last night remember how I said I had a tiny look off well I also suffer from anxiety and of course like many Americans I think I mentioned this yesterday like many Americans my anxiety has been through the roof no matter the mindfulness I practice no matter how much I tell myself hey we only know so much we can only do so much right now so relax right just tell myself all of that that those positive reinforcements but my breathing exacerbated just a touch last night but enough to where you know you think okay is it or isn't it and so I called the advice nurse um much to the nagging of a friend of mine so called the advice nurse thanked me for being so self aware of my body and my my ailments and all that and she set me up with a phone appointment this morning luckily you know I don't meet criteria of someone who could fall in line with someone who could be exposed to the coronavirus I haven't had contact with anyone who is known to be positive haven't recently traveled haven't you know what was what was one of the other things hadn't recently traveled overseas broad anywhere like on a plane or anything haven't come in contact with anyone who is known positive have I been having high fevers have I has my breathing that exacerbated through that there was none of that so that was a good thing so I have to kind of just watch myself and really kind of be away from other people when I can I do have to she did order me asthmatics will no this print is own yay just lost 12 pounds don't want to gain it back with that luckily it's only a small treatment but I did go to run to the pharmacy as you will see here well hearing him this looks like the face of the pandemic thankful that they handed me allowed me to use some hand sanitizer and asked if I needed a mask right away which I said please and I'm so confident did even though and you know I have this tiny cloth I'm glad I did because I was I'm in the pharmacy which was probably the least amount of people I've seen in there at ver but she said yesterday the line would out the door the gal that I brought my prescription through but the gentleman that was in front of me like I guess he didn't check in and turns around he goes okay I'm like oh my god I guess I could take this off I'm not around people now I was like oh my god how could you do that um and even even the girl behind the counter was a little nervous she was like I felt like saying um do you want a mask so yeah come on people if you have a cough cover it up mask well I guess we will see it's a gloomy gloomy day seems fitting right and then I decided well no one was gonna be at the studio safe for my owner and I wanted to put together a couple of classes essentially that I could post online and have my dancers do from home so I was able to put together a couple of class videos together for a couple of combination of classes so that was good it was a lot but you know you do what you can in order to try to still earn money another jobs and other dance gig we're talking tomorrow about how we can string virtually online so I mean that can kind of give you a little bit to you know rest easy still during the day substitute teaching all the schools are closed and governor Newsom came out today saying that schools may still be closed until you know summer August maybe and it's like really I mean I get it I get it I'm laughing and I don't need people going oh my gosh how could you be so insensitive no it's more a state of shock you know that there's a lot of people who can't work from home who work from schools substitute teachers kids I know my friends who are educators who do get to teach online and that's great this but when you're a small business that's why restaurants they're hanging on they're trying to do these curbside pickups to Go's things like that it's you have to be able to still have some sort of an income bigger companies have it they have it in spades they can take a month two months three months off and still figure out a way to recoup that business small business music studios dance studios local studios guess that would go with music studio karate like local karate places local sports clubs for kids that that there's so many things little mom-and-pop grocery stores hair salons you name it I mean the list could go on and on they're small businesses that don't have this type of of budget or finances to be able to withstand this they have to be able to bring in some sort of income so folks please regardless I know trust me I am one of those people I don't have much income but here's a way that all these places are now modifying the services that they offer you or your families please continue to stay with them stay with them during all of this uncertainty because when we come through the other side we still need to be able to have our local businesses with us they are the places the entities that help make our communities what they are it's not just the chains it's it's these local businesses that bring the life and beauty into our communities stay with them support them I supported one of our small businesses this evening especially since I want to try to stay away from people sullens market cafe wonderful wonderful restaurant owned by the zelans here they have a wonderful restaurant called Ella which is like 5-star dining and and sells market cafes kind of like an old-fashioned Delhi it's great and usually when you're there I love going there with with with people because they have a $25 dinner for to go there with a friend my mom loves it and when you're on a date or whatever it's just a great place and it's kind of like a fancy deli in a way with fantastic food anyway saw that they had corned beef and cabbage and Irish I got it I'm gonna have my corned beef and cabbage it was gonna be really sad didn't want to go and fight you know trying to find corned beef at the grocery store I don't really want to be around people um so I saw this and was like oh my gosh this is fantastic be able to just drive up make him put it in on your passenger side so you're not breathing in air that's great and I drove off I actually think I normally not want to tweet my own horn but um I thanked him I was getting emotional and I said hey you know thank you so much for what you're doing um you're doing good and the guy kind of stopped me when wow thank you so much for saying that hey I don't know if I'm just horrible yeah we're all you doesn't know but or just emotional through all of this but I drove off and I started I started getting teary I started getting crying because
