love how a TV is taking the extra they're going the extra mop you to be thank you we can't rekon us we make the decision to stay grounded and to just be aware be aware of where our mind goes so our thoughts are going when people start hoarding it's lumpy it's like it raises the panic it makes you feel like you need support too and guys I decided that I'm just gonna buy what I normally would find I'm not gonna afford I'm not gonna buy for loafs of bread when I normally just find one feels so good to be home that was a long shopping experience and well you know there was really no toilet paper but that's okay I'm just happy to be home and now I get to spend time with my family
