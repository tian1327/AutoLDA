close wasn't going in to work and to be honest with you guys I'm just gonna be completely honest with you right now I have been looking forward to this day you guys know they don't wanna tell me you already know what it is so I'm actually really enjoying the time off I did want to utilize my time into creating videos for you guys and the content videos entertaining video so you won't be at the house bore you have other things to look at besides Netflix and chilling very upset with Bronx because as I was sleeping Brock decided to get on top of my dresser and knock down my SD card and while he was playing with the SD card he knocked out the chip and I don't know where the chip is and you guys know how small that chip is if you work with SD card this is the holder it is a red chip that goes in this that Bronx has knocked out and I don't have a clue to where it is with him put the dadgum poles oh my gosh so now I have to find it I have to edit and get this video together for you guys I have to look for this chip because it actually has material on there have so much news for you guys but I just can't reveal everything in one shot let me tell you something so funny right while I get ready to look for this chip I was telling my friend right I was like you know what I actually feel bad for couples who don't live together and who are not in a committed relationship you know during this time because it's just like hey you want to come over in his life this wait turns out it happened to me one of my friends I was supposed to go and hang out and we're not couples or anything like that but Lu's opposed to going hang out and hit me up and it was like so I was thinking about this whole coronavirus thing and I just want to do you want to postpone this that's so funny so what I would like to know is anybody missing their boo I honestly just don't even like that turn but it's anybody out there like missing a person thank you lord I was about to be sir I was bad to be so livid with you yeah I was yes I found it do you see how small this is in my fingers like can you imagine me having to go through this whole room to look for this  all right so back in the Q dream just probably my favorite room I just wanna make me some tea I wanted to get on here and give a shout out to some of the u.s. distilleries that we have here because instead of making beer which they were out of business of because you know of course this whole thing the owner decided to turn that business into a sanitizer business and make sanitizers because of course as you guys or most of you guys would probably know the main ingredient is sanitizer is alcohol I just love how you said we're so good at making alcohol boom it just came to me that we should definitely create sanitizer and help people out with this because you cannot find it on the shelves anywhere also with that business as well it put another person back into business because I think they actually went bankrupt or you know some some kind of where the business closed down and they also started helping with the sanitizers and it's also free one distillery that I dunno so you guys you could probably look it up and see I didn't quite catch the name but I know they are accepting donations for the sanitizer but I just love how they are creating this to combat this virus and to help you with our need here another shout out that I want to give is to the grocery stores who literally sits a time for our elders to shop so they won't end up in all of the chaos of everybody else who's younger and who's trying to grab every single thing literally they created designated hours for them to shop before everybody else and I just freaking love it it is just such a fantastic honorable thing to do a couple of those stores I know it's Whole Foods dropping sharp Giants and Target there are a few more well there are more stores out there but those other ones cotton that I got down that are doing that so shout-out to you guys thank you so much for helping everyone another thing I was listening to our mayor and he was like I understand everybody wants to give up a helping hand but please stop let it only be so much and I understand that because that's one of those things where it draws back of a crowd to spread this virus honestly I just cannot wait to this thing it's over way too much going on so in case you guys are wondering this company does not sponsor this video at all however I do want to recognize yogi this team that I have been drinking and I've been on this for quite some time now but just not
