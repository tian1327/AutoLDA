 morning it is not a good morning just warning so as some of you may know I go to Yolo University in Chicago and we just got the email that were being sent home for the rest of the semester due to the corona virus I do not want to go home for the rest of the semester we are resuming with online classes so I just moved into the bathroom because my roommate came in to get ready and I didn't want to bore her with other details she already knows but basically what I was gonna say next is that we are gonna have to move out of our dorms unfortunately and live at home and do those online classes at home so today being March 12 we have to move out by March 19th so we have a week and it's gonna be really hard for me I already got more snow like looking at my room and seeing that like I have to pack everything up and like all the memories I've made there with like family game nights with my friends and it was hard and it hit everyone like by surprise I didn't think would be sent home for the rest of the semester that's why I am surprised because I know most schools are already out by now it is what it is yeah it's really hard but I'm gonna record just like for me mostly is like a documentation but also to like show you guys what a student is going through so today I have three classes and one of them is already online we're supposed to be doing a trial which ended up being what's gonna be the reality but I have a class at 11:30 and then at one and then at 2:30 so I'm gonna get ready I'm gonna get some breakfast and go to my polish class in history in person for the last time and then I have theology online and currently my computer is broken I do have to go the Apple store today so I have a rental with me that's the only way I'll be able to do online class so I really need to get it fixed but it's gonna be really hard moving out that's probably what's gonna hit me the most and like saying bye to my friends most of my friends do live driving distance to me which is good so I can drive and see them but it's really hard I can't imagine what people must have felt like when they were leaving abroad because that's like a whole experience gonna take it away from them but yeah my freshman year has been cut short and it makes me really sad but I'll see you guys in the next clip  so it is currently at the denial stage right now but yeah it's really sad like I don't want all this to go I love my room I don't want to leave it but I'm also very stressed because I need to get rid of my Dining Dollars I currently have like 100 and everyone's already buying snacks and stocking up on everything so there's not gonna be like anything left what else is happening um everything is just chaotic right now people are running around everyone's trying to get tickets to go back home my mom's coming tomorrow to take some my stuff I also have a doctor's appointment I have to go to so that's also why she's coming but tonight I feel like I just want to spend some more time with friends and tomorrow my friends and I are gonna have our last family game night but not laughs cuz we're gonna hang out over the next months to come it's just really sad like I don't know how to put it it's very chaotic everyone is really confused and doesn't know if they're happy or angry trying to go with the flow and not think about everything like to seriously   iconic  okay so I'm currently muted right now but I'm on my first unlike that you know almost chatted with my professor so I'm having a great time class starts in one minute you're not everyone's here  good morning guys it is currently 650 and we are on our way to see the sunrise at the beach because we're stupid and we've never done it before and you know we're getting kicked out so that's why we're all awake last night was a really fun my friends we all the RAS I still have not started packing but we'll get to that so you the sunrise     are you all my person     everything you know is in your mind              are you all my person
