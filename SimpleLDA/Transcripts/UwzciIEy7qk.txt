 so i got a request from the hr director to schedule a call first thing monday morning which is always a little bit ominous and after the pleasantry she said i'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news which i think is just about the worst thing you can hear from another person and it sort of just went downhill after that so i'm an architect i never brought that up since most of my work are under nda and i can't really talk about that anyway and one thing i can tell you about architecture is that doing times of uncertainty one of the first thing that clients pull back from is that shiny new multi-million dollar office build out they have been thinking about and unfortunately that is precisely the kind of work i do and this is not the first time that happened to me i still remember the look of shock on my client's face the day the stock market crashed back in 2008 at the time i was a little bit too young to recognize what the ramification which i come to find out two weeks later when the hammer dropped now dying a little bit older and concerning the circumstances i guess i can't really say that i was surprised by their decisions and the only consolation are that i can now say that i know exactly how the other 10 million americans who lost their job within the last two weeks truly feel and that is the number since we just had a record-breaking 6.6 million unemployment claim last week the scale which this nation have never seen in its history i guess what i'm saying is i can really use some friends right now please check out my linking profile make a connection where i'm also starting to post videos about interesting story that had happened to me in my line of work nba expire after you get fired right it is saturday april 4 2020 and it's week three of the soft lockdown here in new york city and the news has gotten worse there are now more than 57 000 confirmed cases of covet 19 transmission and more than 1400 new yorkers have lost their life so far in this pandemic the mortality rate had also gotten worse last week we were at 1.5 percent this week has gone up to 2.4 area hospital are all running at max capacity and i have also read that based on projection we're only six days away from running out of ventilators furthermore based on the number that governor cuomo had released the peak of the case low is not due until april 15 which is still a week and a half away which only means that the mortality rate will continue to worsen and the number of deaths would continue to rise now for a reason that is completely unrelated to the pandemic me and kelly had had to go visit our doctor on a weekly basis for the last few weeks now i had recently purchased an electric scooter for her so that we can get around more easily without relying on public transportation however the trip up to columbus circle in midtown was a little bit too far for her to make since she still practiced riding the electric scooter and trying to get more comfortable on it which means that we would have to take the subway normally a fast and convenient option here in new york city however it is anything but normal right now you're underground stuck in a car breathing the same air as whole bunch of strangers precisely the kind of thing that health organization had all warned us against for our appointment are in the late morning and based on the experience for the past few weeks the subway has been pretty much empty for the most part almost yearly so here's us waiting for the train at the 2nd avenue subway station and for whatever reason there was a lady that was laughing to herself the whole time i mean it was like a scene straight out of some horror movie now that we mine of course the less people they are the safer it is and for the most part we have been feeling pretty safe since there are typically no more than five or six people to the car so there's no issues with maintaining social distance but last tuesday the doctor asked that we show up to the clinic a little bit earlier 6 30 sharp he says so we got in the train station as we have done the last few weeks we waited for the train on the empty pluck except that when the f train arrived it was packed full of people we nervously got on the train looked down the cart to see whether or not there were any open areas that we can move to there were none and since we need to transfer to the d train we got off at the first stop that we could make that transferring the hope that the d train would be better and it wasn't it was morning rush hour for all those people who have to work to keep the city open the grocery store workers the delivery guy in their hi-vis jacket and then and of course the healthcare worker in their green and blue medical scrubs moose had a mask on many were improvised i saw scarf bandana ski mask i even saw a guy with a homemade face mask made out of what looks to be paper towels and rubber bands everyone was slightly on edge and then a man who wasn't wearing a face mask and about three feet from me cough a loud hacking cough that echoed down the otherwise silent subway train car everyone froze for just a second and then immediately we all head down towards the opposite end of the train to get away from the coughing man and then of course it got even more crowded on one end of the subway train and at that point there were so many people that it was basically impossible for us to maintain any sort of reasonable distance with other people or i and kelly could do at that point was just to simply huddle close with our head down and hope that our stop will come quickly it was a scary moment for us but i also felt really bad for everyone who was on a train including the coffee man i mean these are the essential worker who had to work in order to literally keep us all alive and what was a singular scary experience for us to then was a regular daily occurrences and in that moment of panic for us what i saw on the faces in that subway train was resonation you can't dodge an invisible bacteria floating through the air and your luck will only last so long if you're forced to risk regular daily potential exposures and unfortunately those are the fact of life behind all those statistic numbers there was a moment when my relationship with my own fear shifted i mean it was nothing dramatic i was in my parents basement looking for something and all of a sudden the light went out i froze and then immediately fear can and i mean that shot of electricity that course through your whole body but then i pause and realize that i wasn't actually afraid because after all this was the house i grew up in and i know that basement as well as the back of my hand so i sit in that darkness savoring that feeling of fear and strangely how i feel now reminds me of that moment because just as surely as i know that the light in that basement will come back on i also know that this too shall pass in time we just have to hang on long enough to see that day
