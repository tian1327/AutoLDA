you for being my spies I have not seen these tiramisu these alleged tiramisu Oreos in my local market because I don't know what maybe Ralph just doesn't want to carry them they're trying to keep me down I am very interested in trying them you know I have very high standards because I buy mine from Ely only I've had many different tiramisu in my career as a tiramisu critic curious I'm curious of what these tiramisu Oreos will taste like I feel like they're just gonna taste like cream I just I think they're there's no way they can nail all those different layers unless you've had them already please enlighten me in the comments section okay so my eyebrows are nice and fluffy like I prefer them to be it is now approximately 9:45 in the morning this is the time where I practice with my group we practice our routines for performances but we don't have any coming up because management sucks why hasn't black/pink had to come back I don't understand what is the problem how hard is it to just make a song and let these leaves have a music video I've made like three music videos in quarantine get it together yg but like Law & Order SVU I guess it's okay to binge some reruns so I'll just practice one of the old routines I'll just practice kill this love but as you know I want to make some money on this video so I can't play the actual song let's end these emotions yeah yeah yeah bum bum BA bum bum ba ba had to head to hurt that uh let's stop these feelings from the bumper bum ba ba chick that I owe to you because you make me feel so sure sometimes I don't want to go outside last
