 okay so I'm gonna go to Costco and get some rice and some eggs if I can find it and also see how many people are wearing gloves and masks I noticed a lot of people here in my area are not wearing them nobody is wearing masks or cologne nobody I'm like the only one in Costco okay so here's something weird the eggs are completely out see house is 749 for a 24 count of eggs it's completely gone you can still buy 15 dozen for $38 but there's no 24 count that's so strange and then once again no one's wearing masks so I talked to the Costco guy and he said there's no jasmine rice which is the most popular stuff they do have some organic jasmine and they have some basmati rice but we don't eat that I don't want to buy stuff we don't normally eat and I have rice at the house there's someone they pick up some more so yeah that sucks no rice no eggs no beans just this basmati stuff all right so the good news is they have a lot of meats and vegetables which is awesome but yeah sadly no eggs and no rice oh well it is what it is pandemic what do you expect but I am shocked that hardly anyone I mean almost no one's wearing a mask or gloves out in public so another thing I noticed two people at the gas pumps aren't using gloves either look no gloves on him or her there's no one here wearing gloves and people touch the pumps with their dirty coronavirus hands and then spread it to their friends and family back home without even washing their hands you got to be kidding so can you imagine someone actually popping on their hand off on their hand and then they go and touch this pulp alright so let's go inside Smith's and see if we can find eggs and rice and see if people wearing their PPE all right so we have the same problem here Smith's no one's wearing masks or gloves and it's kind of weird because you know this is a pandemic and no one's learned any kind of PPE the good news is they got lots of eggs here Smith's but you can only get one that sucks I got three kids all right so let's stick out the Grocery Outlet here in Reno see if they got rice and eggs and also see if people were in their gloves and masks so the good news is these guys have lots of eggs and they don't even have a limit you can actually buy as much as you want I guess doesn't say one but they do have a notice saying that there's been a demand for eggs all across the country so the prices will go up but at least they have a lot of eggs here and there's no limit that's kind of cool but as you could see no one's wearing masks inside this place so that kind of sucks to see no mass no gloves I got mine on now so I asked one of the workers here about rice they said they have rice normally but they're completely out so there we go another place with no rice alright so yeah that was a lesson learned for sure people are not taking this serious they're not wearing their masks or any kind of mass they're not even covering up their mouths in case take off you don't have to have an n95 mask you can just cover up your face you don't cough stuff out but nobody's wearing any masks and nobody's definitely not working your gloves I was like the only one wearing gloves just seemed like and by the way I put hand sanitizer on these gloves so I'm not spreading it inside my car I just left them on for the video but yeah it just pisses me off that people are not wearing their masks and not wearing gloves it's just such  man they're spreading it I mean dislike those people in Louisiana you know for Mardi Gras they didn't shut down for Mardi Gras and look now it's national hot spot yeah this is frustrating we're never gonna get past this if people don't take it serious whatever you know this is just such  first we had a run on toilet paper which doesn't make any sense and then there's a run on guns and ammo which totally makes sense and now there's a run on eggs and rice so who knows what's next guys again hopefully you have all your stuff because look what happens when you don't have your stuff I'm glad I had my bags of rice I have three bags of rice at home I just wanted another one but all right enough of me ranting take care guys we'll get through this as long as we all chip in and do our part stay clean stay healthy have a good one guys take care
