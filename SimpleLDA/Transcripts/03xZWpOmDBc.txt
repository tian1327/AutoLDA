    hey guys welcome back to my channel I am Kelly and if you're new welcome and if you're wondering yes I just woke up I wanted to do a wake in my life video because I felt like I had a lot going on this week whoa so I went to work today I mean it's Monday after work I was so exhausted that I fell asleep for six hours when I got home but I wanted to share with you some cool stuff because when we're walking around the house again it's 10:00 oh it's 11 16 at night on a Monday evening so a workweek right and when I came home I came home to this new stool look how cute this is my mom is adorable I do think it needs to be a little bigger for my house with my sock sorry but she left me like all these like cute little surprises um a new Water Pik cuz I got one at her house but um yes since I'm not going there anymore she got me one which was really nice mom thank you my mom got me a tray table which again I don't know I kind of like it just you know like this I know this is like Jonathan's like everyday stuff that he uses for his hair and you know his cologne and stuff I think I'm gonna put like a little stool here because he uses this mirror every day and then this is what I got myself I got myself a coffee maker which I'm so excited to use k-cup little guy a tea thing over there I went all out on Amazon this week then I got brackets these cool oh my gosh it's like a Restoration Hardware kind of bracket - I have to stain these and then I'm gonna hang them in my dining room so that I have like little coffee nuts with all my liquor so I have like a little coffee tea area over here we are just busy so exciting Jonathan right now he's actually at my mom's cuz he got her these the cutest pair sneakers ever they're divas she's being surprised right now with those and the cutest thing is that like I feel like my mom is just being she just deserves the world to me pampered so I know my sisters she surprised me the TV and then she stood in shoes and she just always like everyday it's like a new thing and I feel like she's doing the same or maybe she started it actually she's always been that way where she surprises you and then you surprise her and all that stuff so I wanted to do a week in my life and now it's 11:17 and I have to prepare myself to go back to sleep to wake up in the morning I like 6:30 a.m. for work yeah I thought let me pick up the camera because I feel like a lot had just happened in a day even though it was knocked out so let me just set all this up and then I'm gonna prepare my lunch and all that good stuff cuz I have to eat lunch yeah but I can't even set anything up yet so it's just really like taking it out of the package because hey I did not go and get coffee like to make coffee I'm such an idiot and do I have to stain my shelf so I can't even like screw anything in the wall or whatnot but hopefully this week I find the time how does this thing work the coffee maker I got the cool thing about this one it's from Hamilton Beach I really hope that it works really well but um what it does is it does the k-cup look give the cake up but you also have the option to brew regular coffee at the same time so I
