 I just woke up there was a person got leave in the street or at least like 20 minutes I'm pretty tired I don't know what that was about but it's Saturday it's nice out so let's have a good day so personally I don't care that there's a global pandemic I will still do my bed every single day for the simple fact that it just makes me feel better I like being a queen bedroom and a clean environment and I think just having my bed done allows my bedroom to instantly look clean don't judge me yes girl brush your teeth floss your teeth to all my debt and then wash my face with a gentle cleanser to make sure I get all that gunk out and then I use a vitamin C serum so you can see here a tap tap tap tap tap tap and then go in with a moisturizer and then go in with this little tool D puffs my eyes I don't really know if it works that well but it feels good and that's all that matters I guess hugging a glass of water as if there's no tomorrow I don't know why oh okay girl you nasty this is my baby Coco I'll introduce you later I don't want real clothes and so long so they're all wrinkly so I need to stand them hadn't done my makeup and so long but I really was feeling like doing something with my face but I was gonna wear mask so just did my eyebrows and my eyes but first a quick bagel break I love scallion bagels mm-hmm pooping in tik-tok in just wanted to do a really quick colored eyeliner look it's super simple and just a quick little pop of color   can't be bothered to do my hair so this will do  -  spread spreads spreads spreads spreads okay I promise I know how to Swiffer I was just trying to get a cool shot didn't come out as quote this table I swear it gets dirty the second you touch it so I constantly need to be wiping it down  last time some quick grocery shopping and do it about once a week or every other week   baby  when we get home we wash our hands we disinfect every single piece of groceries and then we clean the tabletops and wash your hands again and do it all over again every single time   toilet paper is still out ah the wine  closed wine vodka rum have it all here's an awkward shot of me doing some situps and some other workouts just awkwardly squatting and pulsing at this point I should be reading a book but honestly I love home escapes and I could spend so long playing  we should have done  get every last route   yes your watery you put more ice just like individual cubes strong but stronger I already know you moment of truth let's see she's stronger another one cuz we thirsty here and we love watching YouTube this guy is so funny hey  classic Becky's nothing at this point we were just listening to some music I've been out playing this two-player app on the iPad I highly recommend it there's a lot of options and nice way to kill some time  Cholula yes popcorn yeah then was face I mean some of my friends that I miss so much but at least we get to drink together virtually so that's always nice  I promise i flossed it was just awkward recording it just cleaning my makeup off and then double cleansing using some toner and then this product which is sort of like a toner and moisturizer combined I really like it it's super refreshing this is a BIOS on serum I hate the pump as you could see there I don't know if it's been working but good so far gotta have your moisturiser massaging those chickens in people say that eye cream doesn't do anything for you but it makes me feel luxurious so I don't mind spending two minutes of my life doing it each night some questionable UFC content and that's our day just staying at home stay you ass at home people thank you for watching you don't have to worry about whatever happened next bye
