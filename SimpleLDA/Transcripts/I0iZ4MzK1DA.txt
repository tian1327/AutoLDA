 okay hey guys what's up and welcome back to our Channel so for today's video we want to do a little sit-down with you guys because I wasn't going wrong like the quarantine situation this is a beautiful home but we are going to be coming out with a bunch more of like routine videos what we're doing is getting entertained while we roll quarantines and everything so yeah that's all gonna be coming up soon but first we want to make a little sit-down video addressing with our current living situation with my sister's coming to live with us and just like what's going on how it's been for the last week and what the plan is basically and also Logan to take on it it's a lot for both of us so so yeah we just want to sit down it's a little bit of talking about it with you guys and so first of all for those of you guys who don't know I'm Yasmin this is Logan this is our baby Olivia we have a toddler Leila and two little girls my little sisters who are living with us right now my sister veneks with nine and my sister Ellie who is seven so with everything going on with Kovan 19 all the schools have been closed like I've talked about in waters and videos so they're staying with us because my grandmother is the one who's been raising them and they live about two hours from us so pretty much every life a couple weeks they'll come out and visit us or overwhelm with them just because you know wait to see them and I like to you know help her with them because she is like so working and hazzard a lot on her plate taking care of two little kids at her age and you know while she still has to be like working full-time so because of the schools closing we decided to go and pick them up bring them home with a and kind of adopt them again last summer they actually made Emma list - for those who are just new whatever both of you guys have followed me then it was a lot as well we had just like found out that our strengths alia I was like really sick in the beginning of my pregnancy and having them was like a lot and it is still a lot now but like it was just kind of hard when I was pregnant I think our relationship still was like sort of new and we had a lot to work on like ourselves we kind of had to like get through that and so yes they stayed with us for a lot of the summer but then they ended up going back to be with my grandmother for like the beginning of the school year when school started because we decided like we weren't ready yet but with all this stuff going on we decided to go and pick them up and bring them home with us because my grandmother is still going to be home and working from home and it's gonna be hard for her to entertain them and work from home by herself right now so we went got them and they're now living with us Logan how what is your take on everything how do you think the last week is gone and like what do you think about them who living with us I suffered last week I honestly think it's been going great everyone's been helping out exactly how they should everyone's doing everything they need to do um Layla's a lot more entertaining which is very good cuz now she has two people to hang out with obviously awfully yes you can't hang out with I think we're doing great with them now I it's it's honestly awesome having them here yeah as much as it is like a lot to have two more kids to take on they do also help a lot with our kids and that's awesome it is also a lot because it's not like the summer time where we can just kind of like hang out and do whatever they do still have school and we do want to like stick to like a school routine for them so you've both been trying to like I've showed in my last video like learn how to home-school down and do like more educational stuff with them while this is going on Logan that I have been like trying to work with them and help them with their schoolwork but they both love living - and it's awesome for them because they you know like don't have we also my sisters and I all have different dads and so a number of our dads like we're ever around so it's nice for them to have like almost like a father or like older brother yeah yeah I'll take closer - older brother yeah yeah yeah I look like a lot of like board games with them like it's really fun just hanging out with them so it's it's I think it's definitely like to actually have a guy to hang out with it's not just like in and out of the picture yeah exactly it's almost like they entertained us as yeah the last week we've been doing a lot of like yeah playing a lot of board games obviously helping them with their schoolwork stuff like that yeah giving them more like school project to do to get them entertained they've been learning a lot about taking care of babies like normally Ellie my younger sister like isn't really able to do much with them but she's been learning a lot she really is like very determined first of all very determined to potty train my love yeah that's funny but we have like she always comes to when she's like - why do you have a baby potty like in your bathroom well it's not gonna use it all the time and I was like well like it's a problem the potty all day so she taught Lela like sign language for bathroom and like it's like teaching her to use the potty Lori is awesome she was really upset actually earlier today because like on Aliyah is a little bit harder for her like hold she like always wants to hold her but I won't let her like walk around and already I could she like doesn't really get it yet um and she was like Steve gets very upset that she can't like always make all me a happy and she's like I just want her to be happy with me for once they're really sweet with the babies and yeah it's awesome okay sorry my camera battery died but yeah so that's pretty much how everything's gone for the last week and it's been going like really well like a lot better than I was like thinking just based all like how unlike last got harder for me because ugly no I'm definitely harder because Yasmin pregnant Yasmine is not fun to deal with Hey oh yeah has been would get frustrated very easily with everything yeah just stretch it out on me and the kids no not like angrily but it's just I don't get stressed easily and then blame it on everyone but like not like I'm not saying yeah aren't you with anyone but you like would go to your room be mad at everyone like yeah but yeah true but I also just had absolutely no energy like it because I was so sick I like this get anything I was like it was just not good not a good combo but this time between going great but that doesn't mean that it's not harder for us we already have kids so it's not like it makes like all that big of a difference but two more kids does add on you know extra like people that we have to be feeding all the time extra like dishes more laundry like it does which isn't hard at all yeah it's not hard I wouldn't say at all because we can both be yeah yeah we have both of us and we can both be attending to different people and it's really it's not that challenging yes and also they are at an age where they can you know take care of themselves and help take care of the kids too so overall I think they help just as much as we have to attend to them yes sorry about it's been a pretty good balance but yeah it's awesome having them with me and I'm just like I always have this anxiety almost like when I don't have them I'm always just like worried just because I know that they've like been missing the things that I've been through and I just want like I always want them to be okay and we'll do be happy and then I was like so sad when they have to leave and I just like always I don't know so I always like have some anxiety that I like don't know where it comes from but then I've known not like when they were with me last summer and when they're with us now but it's like goes away if you actually communicate with them better but obviously all parents know this that have parents or have children over like six seven you can't just demand things you have to actually speak to them you have to have just as much respect for them as they have for you that's basically yeah like in just Angus was like Todd looks like they alarms been watching you so if you don't treat them like with respect and like yeah you know what's gonna make them want to do stuff for you yeah exactly just the same way like I mean everyone has their own opinion on this and stuff like and I know there's like certain things in the Bible about anything just like hitting your kids like you know like using like discipline in that way is like I don't know I feel like I mean it's some circumstances I don't know people have their own parenting choices to make whatever but in my opinion I feel like using that kind of discipline just teaches them that that's okay to do people but like I was saying my like anxiety I feel like my anxiety is gone like one good there because I know that like they're there and I'm there to be there for them and especially like when I was like older and understand things more like I don't know just these a lot of like emotional support and stuff and like yeah so I'm just I'm very happy that they're with us yeah even though it is more it is more work I don't think so that's well I don't agree well I don't know I think it's it even sounds equals out but it's not more work yes that's why I planned on okay yeah whatever and it doesn't go up but also they do you think they are older they do still have moments where we have to deal with that oh yes you know tantrums like for like there and it's not like at all the tantrum but they do you have most with you've decided that you understand something and or like they don't listen and we have to kind of like like hey and like check them and make them check to this house and so yeah so they just off moments it does still take our energy love them and especially for Logan like they're my sisters like and he has no reason to be caring for them but he does anyway so that's the pros and cons of of things going on with everything that's been happening last week I guess but as far as future goes uh we don't really know what's gonna happen because no one no one really knows what's gonna happen as far as like everyone being quarantines and how long that's gonna last and just like no one really knows what's ahead of us right now we're just all kind of just waiting as far as like my guess is go I would think that they're probably not going back to school for the rest of this school year I think it's safe to say that they'll probably be staying with us for the rest of the school year which then also probably means end of the summer my grandmother does have this like summer camp that she sends them to so maybe at that point well obviously that's probably also going to be gentle unfortunately I don't know what I mean yeah who knows who knows whose knows what's gonna happen yeah so as of right now this like living situation was done living with us and us just like being home with all the kids is probably pretty permanent for the next couple months probably like who knows maybe this year if for some reason like if next fall school just start up again and this whole thing is solved we are hoping to have them with us and have them like enrolled in school near us so yeah that's the ultimate goal is that they stay with us so yeah that's pretty much all that we have to say about guys and I mean II to do it is gonna be a lot to take on like as time goes on older kids do come with more like college and high school and like you know sports and stuff but I think we're ready to take that on and excited to take that on and it's almost like I think we're gonna get to have like a lot more experience one once our kids are that named to do so and we also do have like family support like we do still have my grandmother to like have them sometimes and we just love like my aunt who is willing to like have them sometimes to at Logan's family helps us a lot and I'm sure some goes on it's gonna be a lot more a roller coaster and there are gonna be times that are harder like the things that we like when we were even expected with like I don't know a pair of dating we come up and it's gonna be a lot but we already do have kids so we need to be prepared for this stuff so yeah it's all a learning experience thank you guys so much for watching and for supporting us he didn't ever like we didn't ever ask some staff and they're only 18 and 19 we never expected we would've been raising four kids you never expected I never expect that we're raising any kids and here we are especially again what again it is yeah but thank you guys so much for all of our support we really do appreciate it yeah yeah it's so amazing and also I just saw my comment were turned back on for my last video so hopefully they're on for this video too because like I don't know I've been
