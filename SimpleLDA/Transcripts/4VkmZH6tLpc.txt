 hello and welcome to my moving vlog  the movers are almost here and my apartment is pretty much all packed up i have a load in the wash or in the dryer that i'll need to grab so now i'm just waiting on the movers and for my bed sheets to dry and then they will pack it all up and we will be at the new apartment so i'm not sure how much i'll be able to vlog today because obviously it's going to be very busy but i'll try to vlog as much as i can and this morning when i grab my camera i realized i accidentally packed my memory card and i was kind of freaking out but i found which box it was in so i'm now able to make this it's so dark in here because i took down like the lights and all the lights are unplugged besides these two this apartment has like no natural light at all um my bedroom's literally dark like this is with the window this is how dark my apartment is at it's like almost 10. that's why i'm so excited about my new apartment because there's better light especially in my room so i can film more videos and stuff i still need to take this light down i'll probably do that now okay guys it's been like an hour since i last vlogged and they're still not here i've just been sitting waiting next to me and said they went to the wrong address which i don't know how they do that because i'm the one that put the address so i don't know how they went to the wrong one but they said five more minutes so just waiting on them it's been about 30 minutes and they've got most of the boxes gone i couldn't get the rod down for my curtains so i just cut them off i'm leaving the rod i hope whoever listener next enjoys it and i'm throwing my curtains away my new apartment doesn't even like it has built-in um like curtain shades or whatever so i don't even need okay i'm doing an update um it's been an hour since i got here and they've pretty much moved everything into the truck um like all the boxes most of the furniture we still have all my bedroom furniture to do so about my bedroom stuff um i bet it takes at least another hour i just ordered joe's pizza um they're gonna deliver it in like 30 minutes you can hear them packing my stuff  but yeah that's my update so i'll talk to you probably when my jones gets here because i'm starving yum the best pizza ever my room is empty  it looks so much smaller without a bed but remember my new room is even smaller so we will see how it turns out it is pretty much cleared out nothing in my closets it is empty i'm so excited to move though oh my goodness guys it is all cleared out the movers just took the last batch and they are about to go take everything to the new apartment it is bare there's nothing it looks so weird i made it to the new apartment now i'm just waiting on the movers to get here hopefully soon i bet they drove pretty slow but we made it 30 minutes later and they made it and i hope everything is still intact and not broken i hope nothing broke because i already broke my hanging little chandelier and my cake stand by accident so okay i'm doing my first load in the dishwasher sounds so stupid to be excited about but i'm telling you no apartments in new york have a dishwasher okay the one thing that does suck about moving during this time of nothing being open is like i'll need a new one of these but because it doesn't fit but i obviously can't go buy one and i can't amazon prime it because i'm only here for a few more days and like same with this i need a trash can but this will have to do i just met who lives above me this really cute old man came down the introduced himself so now i know my upstairs neighbor my room is filling up my bed some more progress i think they almost have everything out and then they're just gonna have to assemble um my bed but oh my goodness everything's almost in okay everything is very crammed in and i mean i'm very crammed in but i started organizing a little if you don't know me i'm ocd to the max like see that is bugging me the whatever that's called to get dust off and a bathroom update i'm so glad that fits because now i don't have to get it over the toilet thing um i'm gonna need to find spot for those i have to get a smaller one of these um for my silverware because it doesn't fit in the drawer i'm gonna set up my perfumes right there okay everything's in here i felt so bad for them they were taking forever so i told them i will just finish building everything but yeah this is a mess okay so you'll know how i was so worried about the bedroom but i can't believe it my dresser fits in here and my bed and a nightstand i think i'm gonna end up putting like a tiny little desk where the nightstand is um so i can make it kind of like a vanity so i can get ready there and then my mirror is right there so i can do outfit photos and these are some of my clothes in the boxes my rug and now to tackle all this okay i sorta tackled the bathroom i'm gonna put my perfumes there um surprisingly the drawers are not fully filled and i still have room in my medicine cabinet so the bathroom worked out perfect i was scared i wouldn't have enough storage but i do and some of my stuff here's the progress um i need to figure out how to get the door on this because they did it wrong but it's coming along i put all my closet stuff in there all the way out here so now i'm gonna try to tackle these boxes okay more progress every time i film is just for progress but i put together my table i'm definitely gonna have to get a smaller one but for now this will work until i'm back in the city full time um same with this i'm going to order like a round um what's this called whatever table i'm so tired i cannot think and obviously my tv will be hung once i get back but no one can come hang it now and then i'm gonna get a white couch for sure so it um opens up the space a little and then hopefully a smaller table will help with this everything's so crammed but i'm selling everything over here i really wish i could have sold everything before so everything's not so crammed right now but i definitely need to get rid of furniture so no worries is not staying like this and i'll end up doing a apartment tour once i fully decorate everything and get it perfect okay guys oh this angle is horrific here but i'm going to end this vlog off here and go get ready for bed i'm absolutely exhausted and my back is killing me i will talk to you in my next video and keep you updated on the apartment progress i promise it's not going to end up looking like how it looks right now because it's so cluttered and filled with stuff i'm gonna have to get rid of um and replace a few things with smaller pieces but for now this is how it looks until i come back and i'm able to redo it and everything and buy new stuff but thank you so much for watching and i will talk to you in my next video
