 let's talk about New York so it's a rainy day I've poured myself a nice little cup of Earl Grey and wondering what to talk about so you know a bit of this channel is supposed to be about my life in New York and it's supposed to be more kind of things like how do you get an apartment in New York what is that process like but also like you know this is kind of the life of a New Yorker like what are the subways like what is what does it mean to be a New Yorker you know so I've lived here I'm going on my eighth year now and some people would say that's actually not a true New Yorker and you know fine personally I don't feel that way I feel like home is where the heart is you know which is cliche as hell but it's true and I've lived here long enough that I'm like I know what the tea is like tea I know what the tea is like you know it's fine right so you know first things first about kind of my channel in general I filmed a lot especially of the initial like five episodes or whatever before all of this happened I did my kitchen renovation and the floral design and like the hanging floral I did all of that in like January I have a office design video coming up for a friend of mine in Brooklyn I did that in February it is the end of April and I am 34 days into isolation and I've left my apartment five times in 34 days so that's what it is in New York right now sirens you hear sirens all day you hear them dozens of times a day currently New York City has lost over 10,000 people to the virus the United States has lost 40,000 people to the virus which is more than any other country and we make about 25% of those losses and you know so when people used to talk about like oh my god your rent so high like how do you mean why do you do it I was like I used to always say basically without a hesitation that your rent in New York is not for your apartment it's for living in New York especially if you are paying a premium like you live in Manhattan like I do do you pay a premium because you are closer to where everything is right so what does it mean then when you are stuck in an apartment in your actual home which is the city is unavailable to you you know it's this heartening you know so you know during this crisis you know people are like so what are you doing how you staying sane well I was able to finally have the time to actually edit all that footage that I tech I took you know in the three months prior to do this so there's that we'll see how I can keep this up after the world comes back to normal right so there's that I've you know been able to draw again I'm slightly a workaholic which would maybe explain why if someone would decide to start a YouTube channel and this you know in this time because I have to have something to and I have to have productivity and work and that kind of thing and I understand that you know we kind of have a health issue one could say with with toxic productivity in this country and I am participating in that but it's a way that I cope it's a way that I deal with things in my opinion you know in the face of adversity you need to take action and you need to do things which is ironic given what we're going through now because essentially the the best way to defeat this thing is by arguably inactivity which is kind of crazy to people and it was kind of a hard pill to swallow you can tell this because people are actually protesting to reopen the country and personally I find it insulting um and just absolutely insane how you know so how am i saying like positive and things like that during this time I'm doing it by being productive because that's what works for me now am i productive every single day have I spent 35 days making and shooting and editing and hustling YouTube videos absolutely not oh absolutely not I've only I've only like done like seven or eight videos now you know like no no no no it's absolutely not what I'm doing my plenty of days where I have been horizontal in that bedroom all day and I am perfectly okay with that perfectly okay with it because you know one thing that I have learned from this is that it is healthy to chill the hell out and this has been the literal one opportunity since I've been an adult a working adult to do this this is the one time because I I literally cannot worry about work because there's nothing I can worry about there's just very little we can do especially because I work in custom clothing so everything is made for my customers now if I was more of a ready to wear a custom if I had a ready-to-wear customer base rather it could be a little different because I could still sell from our online store unfortunately I've spent the last you know two years you know moving my customer base choices you know like that's just what happened right how we will move on is going to be incredibly telling if we don't have extreme government change in November that will be very telling in the response to this if we do not come back to this world and appreciate it a little bit better that will be very telling if we can't acknowledge the opportunities that we had with this that will be telling you know we I'm not one of those people that's like this is like because it's not and for so many people it's not you know you know for a lot of people who can't really get unemployment because they were working three part-time jobs none of which would would would count as unemployment and now they can't get any of the other jobs they're very much in a rut and I understand if those are the people that are protesting and wanting to and go back to work and this down the other but you know what that is that's a fundamental flaw in our government and in our ability to take care of the populace and so you really need to look at who you're yelling at and why you're yelling and also who benefits from that yelling this is the time to not be foolish this is the time to be empathetic this is the time to take people to task that need to be taken to task and we will see you know we will see what the world looks like it's my hope that people in Los Angeles continue to want to see the mountains next in Los Angeles that they literally have not seen in 40 years and be like you know maybe we shouldn't drive so much maybe we should invest in either cleaner transportation or in public infrastructure maybe you know a lot of companies can realize you know I don't need to actually have this huge building that paying all this room for for my employees to come to I can just have everyone work from home therefore we are reducing our carbon footprint I am saving on my rent as a business because I might be a bleeding-heart liberal but I can I can see you know I can see the business perspective as well but we have to do the best we can do to get through this as a community as a society and I mean I would like to be like as a nation but this is a global situation we can't just be focused on the United States and how we do it in this and the other like we have to we have to consider the ramifications of everyone in the world if you eat you know if we want to be a global leader then we actually have to lead and you do that with empathy with kindness with consideration not necessarily with money definitely not necessarily with your troops you know you do it by setting an example and currently the example that we are setting is just not that great so I will say this I am incredibly thankful that I do live in a state that is taking this incredibly seriously and are you know and who goes toe-to-toe with officials in the federal level because if that because I I absolutely believe if we did not have those people in this protection on the state level that New York City would have reopened two weeks ago and we would be not 10,000 dead but 30,000 dead or 40,000 dead because you know because because of recklessness so it's my hope to come out of this a wiser person come out of this as someone who actually takes a little bit better care of myself and other people someone who can't have a better work and home balance someone that can something I can really try to contribute in a positive way and that's my charge to all of you um I'm going to end this video so at seven o'clock every night the whole of New York turns up their windows they come and they clap in the yell and they honk and they bang pots for our health care professionals and for me it's not just them it's our grocery store workers just you know the police who again the NYPD has been has been devastated the MTA has had devastating losses you know they've had tens of people die you know last time I looked it was like 60 MTA workers but that was like a week ago who knows what that is now and it's for everyone who does not have the privilege of staying home so I'm going in this video with just a small Tibbett of me yesterday when the Sun was was out on my roof at seven o'clock listening to this chorus it reminded me of the last night I was in Istanbul and they have the call to prayer multiple times a day and I was again on the rooftop of the hotel that we were staying at I was up there and the call to prayer started and you just sort of hear it like from like back there then like over there and then suddenly it's just this beautiful chorus and it's probably great that I do not speak Arabic I did not know the language and so I could just appreciate it for the music that it was and that's what I think this is so thank you to them think yourselves you know give yourselves a break maybe literally like me and try to use this in a positive way I thank you guys and we'll see you next week
