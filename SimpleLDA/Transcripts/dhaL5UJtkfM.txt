 they state it's day 2 day 3 feels like day but it's actually day C remember I got my feet my anti dust mask it was like I'm pretty sure I got those like early February or January anyway another day here we are day 3 of quarantine clearly not so much of a quarantine because I still have to go to work this was early in the morning when I went to get my coffee before work at Dunkin Donuts look at just how deserted no chairs and no one allowed to sit there now we're here at work and we spent most of the day giving out laptops to students that need laptops I don't like anything else and there are some sheet that they have to fill out as you can see we already partially filled them out for them just to save time and make sure that there is a line and you know we are social distancing ourselves we also sanitize down chargers because let me tell you they work pretty gross and just goes to show that we need to keep more maintenance of that these hallways are always full of life full of kids as you can see all that art up and just the other day all the teachers were in this hallway planning on remote learning of course today have to take my lunch set some Caesar salads it's so crazy how just a day before the Starbucks is still opened and just like every other business they have to close could it help by going inside wonder if my favorite local beef Serbia's what because I want pizza and also look at that they have caution tape to make sure that nobody is sitting down on the chairs like never and we left it I think I would see this that might be repeats area fades so are typically at least it's good to know that there's still stock dust on there is yummy even you pick it up so many bar restaurants are also selling to go and it's because they're also selling alcohol to go found that pretty interesting my mom and I found it pretty funny and we also saw this other place that had people sitting outside gotta give it to them there's social distance some of them distinct thing themselves can't speak English what is that and we noticed there were selling oil in the week of course cool saddlebag we're and still supporting our local business of course I had to stop by the supermarket to check out what's going on still need a couple of things your friend also needed some produce that we had not stocked up stocked up on yet and let's tell that it's awful so what did you say have you noticed that a lot of restaurants I saw I thought some restaurants are doing that now oh one of those maybe that's actually not a bad idea touchdown New York doesn't give up off the facts I was going upstairs on the train cousin upstairs and I saw a whole pack of hot dogs just on the ground Oh somebody's gonna come fighting for that hot dog with this apocalypse  seriously  all of a sudden they want to be healthy during the apocalypse   well my friend has already wrapped up his shopping I have to get those ice cream during and of course the new wave of hellos and defies elbow fives look at this I just found out that my mouth closed in the dark fire love that anyway take care of stay safe and don't leave your house bye
