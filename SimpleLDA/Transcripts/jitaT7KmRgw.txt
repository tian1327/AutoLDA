 well it's day 2 of quarantine I've got cereal and I hate my life so today my bags were supposed to be picked up from my accommodation in the UK and they weren't picked up because some form was missing apparently so then I had to call and figure out what the hell was going on and then I kind of got it resolved so they're gonna be going tomorrow sorry I'm sorry gee they're gonna be going tomorrow to pick up my form I mean not my form with my luggages and I finally heard back from the mail and fly people so that I can get my bag that is supposed to be shipped to me from the airport because apparently I had too many liquids Thank You UK for having such a dumb rule and now when I went to go look and figure it out it's gonna cost me 69  pounds I have that tiny-ass bag shipped to me which is ridiculous and on top of that then I got kicked out of the site and on top of that I'm still trying to figure out how to cancel my trip tomorrow for Dublin because clearly I'm not gonna be able to go and I need to make phone calls to that this is just just will do it like I just can't not only are they closed now I just this  is ridiculously I really do hi and I have an updated you guys about well yesterday I was just feeling really emotional and I was stressed and a migraine and there was a bunch of stuff going on um my boyfriend brought over Olive Garden for me because I had wanted Olive Garden and he stayed for a little while because my mom let him which was nice and then he left and yeah I just watched the office until it was really late and I played iphone games with my boyfriend and I was on tick-tock for a bit I didn't make any I was just watching them yeah and then today I woke up at like 1:00 please don't judge me I fell asleep at like 4:00 6:00 in the morning something like that it's like 346 right now my mom's ticking in that she was awake earlier but today I'm actually gonna step out because it's the primary elections today and although quarantine is necessary so that we can all like not spread germs and stuff like that I do think it's incredibly important to go vote and because I have the right to vote I'm gonna go do it so yeah I'm gonna do that in a bit whenever she wakes up I guess yeah I don't know I think I'm gonna start unpacking my suitcase one of my suitcases tonight clean up my room a bit just cuz it's getting really messy I need to start putting things away I've been very lazy because I've been very stressed and emotional and stuff so yeah you need to get that under control but yeah that's about it come on I'll keep you guys updated on what happens like me and my mom are also gonna try to go to some of like local family-owned businesses so that we can stock up on some things hopefully there are things available because I know everyone's freaking panicking and taking everything which is shitty because me and my mom have no medicine like at all so if we get sick  um yeah we're going on for the paper because my mom was tucked up on that stuff so I stocked up on paper towels we always have cleaning supplies like on the head we're good it's literally just medicine that we need which is really important hopefully you find some even if it's expensive because I've been looking on Amazon and there's no medicine at all which is shitty so I'm just praying that we find some because any we'll do some hauls maybe yeah I'm gonna eat and yeah I'll keep you guys updated all right well here's an update um I prayed several times out because my mom decided to take a nap for the whole freaking day and I didn't know what time the pool was closed I was trying to go off my memory from 2016 when I worked the poles and I remember getting out at 9:00 so I could have swore that it closed at 8:00 cuz it took us like an hour to get everything together and whatnot so she was sleeping way too long and I was like okay well it's already like 7:00 something on you wake her up because we live like really close to the polling place we can just run over whatever I wake her up and then she decides to tell me Oh what time is it and I was like seven something and she's like the polls are closed and I was like why would you go to sleep without setting alarm one and two why wouldn't you at least tell me what time to wake you up to make sure that the poll is like we can get to the polls on time like why why why why why would it make sense to fall asleep without an alarm or at least tell me hey I want to take a nap and tired wake me up at this time so we can go to the polls it was the one freaking things I was looking forward to doing today I don't even get to do it here I'm gonna go crying again because my muscles oh my god I hate everything I really do I just don't even know what to do anymore because I don't like she's been doing anything fine look Ramona fire season even scaring me my mental health is at this point hi guys please excuse that I look like a mess it's 6:37 I've been up since one think yeah I've been sleeping pretty late um not like there's much else to do anyways besides the things that I want to get to yesterday I decided sorry my hair is like a complete mess have to shower yesterday I decided that I wanted to paint these white slip-on bands that I have because I adored my white slip-on bands but I tried really hard to clean them and it just not made a Morse so they're really disgusting they look pretty much like greenish yellow like they have that tint to it which is really sad because I love my white slip-on bands but I don't know how to clean them so that they stay white and they don't turn like yellowy I've tried everything and that I've seen and it just never works they always end up turning like a weird tent cuz I've had two pairs already the other ones I ended up shrinking accidentally when I tried to wash them and detergent because I've tried so many things to clean them like I said and I know that I should never wash them with detergent again after that incident cuz then I had to throw them out and buy new ones and now these are dirty so what I figured I would do is take this time in quarantine to paint them and I thought it would be really cool thing to do so why for that video but yeah so I ordered I have acrylic paint but I don't have like a sealant or anything so I just ordered a while ago from Amazon some like fabric pens that I can use to like you know help and then I also ordered Mod Podge very curly paint so that I can seal them and yeah I also ordered what else I was a book and I ordered lilo and Stitch because it's my favorite one of my favorite Disney movies but it's up there it's like I think it pretty much is my all-time favorite Disney movie I just love it so much it makes me cry little kid but yeah I ordered it's like a duo set so it has the first and the second one and I used to own both of them I think I still have the second one I don't know where my first one went I bore the  out of that movie as a kid and my mom to this day is like I don't know what you did with it but we've never been able to find it since and I was like okay and I think they ended up taking it out of Netflix which made me really sad so I just ordered the duo and then I ordered some medicine which was so hard to find true God so yeah I'll have that shipped to me last night I ordered some clothes because I was stressed shopping and right now I'm stressed shopping is long I have some items from Nasty Gal that I really want to get and I'm just realizing that nasty guy is cheaper in London significantly cheaper in London which is what excuse me a little sad but there's nothing I can do about that now so yeah there's just a dress that I've been eyeing and then this bikini cuz I really want to find a nice white bikini hoping that everything blows over by summertime and that I do get to go on my vacation with my boyfriend trying to stay hopeful but yeah there's um just the dress the bikini like some pant cover up things and then this really pretty purse that I saw but yeah we shall see I cleaned my room yesterday why did some decluttering in that and like finally unpacking one of my suitcases and then I got really depressed because I actually didn't get to go vote but you guys saw that clip and then I didn't want to pack anymore and I stopped but yeah I'm gonna get ready so that me a man can go to Target um I asked her if I was able to go and she said if you bought and I was like please I need to get out of this house like I just want a small fresh air even if I you make me stay in the car I really don't care like it's gonna like fresh air like I just there's just nothing like it I just really want to go out oh yeah I have my two books that I'm in the middle of reading on my nightstand one of them I'm close to finishing but I accidentally left here when I was home for break and I didn't get to take back with me to London and so I started reading a different book in London and so that's why I'm in the middle too right now so I just have those on my nightstand to grab whenever I feel like it but I'm gonna try to finish the one that I had started and then didn't take the book with me for break so that I can work on that and yeah I think when I get to Target I'm gonna look at the craft supplies and see what they have see what I can get like what ideas come to me so that I can do something besides reading which I really don't mind reading I really enjoy reading and I have plenty of books to get to and I ordered a new one on Amazon that's been in my cart for forever I just had it in like the you know and I Amazon how you have that section of your cart where you can float these things to cart I have so much stuff in that area because I'm like mom I don't even know I don't need that now like I just wait till whenever I'm like you know so yeah I'm excited if I get to go out so I'm gonna get ready for that and see what kind of arts and crafts I can get trigger and hopefully I get some strawberries because I really want strawberry and some mangoes but yeah I'll let you guys I'll keep you guys updated I know I've been doing a really horrible job at vlogging the last like two days I've just been sad if I'm honest and I've been crying a lot and I really have already uploaded an upside videos and I just think that I as much as I want to be real with you guys I'm not trying to depress you so
