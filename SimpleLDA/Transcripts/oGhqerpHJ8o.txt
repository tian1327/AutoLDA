  hey guys welcome back to my channel and thank you for tuning in to episode 8 of my quarantine washday series so today's the quarantine wash day is going to be extremely different and it's going to be extremely different because I so I'm just trying to figure out how I want to address this situation on camera it's going to be different because George Floyd was murdered this past week due to police brutality a police officer intentionally held his knee to this man's neck for nine minutes until he went unconscious and he later died in police custody so you know this has just really been away heavily um this week on a lot of us me especially when incidences like this occur I can't help but want to get active and want to get out there and fight for my rights my people stand with my people I love my black people I love being black and just the fact that other people don't see how amazing and incredible it is to be black because they don't have our experience in you know what I'm saying it just sucks that we aren't recognized for the amazingly talented and incredible people that we are but um yeah so this week's quarantine watch it's gonna be a bit different I will not be washing my hair today is my filming day on for quarantine wash day but instead I'm going to be out protesting in downtown Atlanta so for this week's watch it I'm just gonna do my protest hairstyle I'm gonna show you guys how I'll be wearing my hair to this protest I thought about this canceling wash baby just because you know my mental health has been so affected and I just really don't like you know coming on camera and being happy and bubbly and making this corner can watch tape but I'm here I rather empower myself instead of shutting down so yeah I'm just gonna do my hair I'm gonna show you guys how I'll be wearing my hair to the protest and then after I will upload some vlog footage of me at the protest so you guys can see my experience and just see what it was looking like out there you know while I'm out there so I only have a limited amount of time because I know it is 12:30 and the protest I want to get there by 3:00 so yes let's get into today's protest hairstyle my hair right now is an old braid out um it actually does have a little bit of flaking going on but that's alright because we are going to hide that in today's hairstyle so what I was thinking about doing was just splitting it down the middle and then flicking it back and having two buns at the sides so that is the plan for this video is to do two low buns so what I'll be using for this hairstyle I'll be using some wet line extreme gel I'll also be using two chrome refreshers I'll be using the uncle fungus daughter thirsty curls leave-in curl revitalizer and i'll also be using the Camille Rose shaken hair spritzer and this is my all-time favorite curl refresher I talked about this in a previous quarantine washday update video so I will be using this product again and then the last part I'm using is a shining star by Uncle punkin solder and this is a hair and scalp elixir so this is just to add some shine and make my hair look like it's you know all new and freshly washed even though it's not I've got my wide tooth comb I've got my edge brush i've got bobby pins just in case I don't think I'll need them but I have them um I have I um soft bristle brush and then I have two scrunchies all right so I'm gonna go ahead and get my middle part situated I'm going to just extend this all the way to the back of my head   so I'm going to take both of my car refreshers and apply those all right now I'm going to take some gel and apply that so starts licking down my hair   all right so next I'm going to take my shining star here at scalp elixir and I'm going to apply this on top    all right so I've got both of my buns done and all I'm gonna do now is lay down my edges   all right so my hair is done all I'm going to do is put on my headscarf to make sure everything stays in place while I'm out there protesting in the heat so I just think that it's super important for me to attend this protest I just feel it in my soul like that this is where I need to be and this is what I need to do I can't just continue to sit at home and hope that things will get better I'm at that I thought I'm at that age where now it's my my generation that has to deal with this and we are the ones who have to be on the frontlines fighting because it's going to be us and our kids dealing with this in the future so it's just I just can't sit back and watch these things happening to my people in the black men in my community and just not do anything so yeah that's how strongly I feel about it I'm really about that action okay I just hope that I'm going to this protest I hope everything remains peaceful I know that there are going to be people there trying to agitate us and get us out of our character but you know it just this protest it just has to be done it just has to be done no justice no peace and we can't just continue to sit back and let this happen to our people so I wish I was spending my Friday doing something else but you know honestly since this is since this is reality and this is what black people have to go through there's no place that I would rather be than to be surrounded by my people fighting for what's right mm-hm so yeah I can't wait to get out there and um just see what it's looking like this is also a learning experience for me this is the first protest I'm attending my mom she was definitely worried because you know people hate black people so of course she's gonna be worried about her child I'm going to a black lives peaceful protest but it has to be done you know what I'm saying you can't allow fear to get in the way of what's right they want us to be fearful they want us to be scared to come out of our homes they want us to stay home and not to fight for our rights and I'm gonna do exactly the opposite of that I'm gonna get out there and fight with my peoples mm-hmm so yeah I'm going to just let this sit let my hair you know set in place and let the scarf work its magic and I will be back to show you guys the final look all right so my hair is done it is laid and I'm ready to protest so I'm bringing a whole bunch of supplies with me on to the protest just cuz you never know people be getting crazy but I'm bringing a whole bunch of extra supplies on masks sanitizer band-aids had extra pair of clothes you know we're still in a pandemic so I do have to be careful going out to protest but I'm also not going to let this pandemic stop me from you know fighting for what's right because that's what they want us to do um so yeah I thought about wearing this bandana all my edges because y'all know when you get out in that Georgia heat it just start rising okay also do have a hat too just in case but you guys will also be using this to cover my face cuz I'm getting caught I'm just kidding I'm not doing that um so I will be bringing vis bandana and the Hat this bandana is just for multiple uses on my case my edges get out of hand walking in that heat or if I need to cover my face for some reason I'll have this bandana as well   so this is my final protest hairstyle not only will this Mandana be for my edges but it will also be an extra cloth if I need it I'll have it ready and available right on my head I can just pick it off on like my eyes or whatever I need it for so thank you guys so much for tuning in make sure you stay tuned for the protest vlog that will be coming right after this thank you guys so much for understanding why I had to change my quarantine washday and I hope that we all can fight for justice in whatever way that you're comfortable with that's protesting or being in Twitter activists or just posting awareness on your social media there are things that you can do to contribute and to ultimately help us get to our goal of justice for all black people in the u.s. so with that being said here is the protest vlog and I'll see you guys in my next quarantine to watch the episode bye guys  oh I cannot talk with this mask on alright guys so I am here I'm actually walking to the meetup location just see how many people there are that are here I got a part board piece so I have a marker in my fanny pack and I need to write something on it I don't know what I want to write though I could do like no justice no peace I could do hashtag black well as matter hashtag George Floyd I don't know I was gonna kind of wait till I got over there and see what other people are writing but I'm sure it'll be something along the lines of that so we'll see alright so I'm gonna show you guys my fire no test is healthy first one so I am here all alone I might be meeting somebody later but it will be about this it's a lot of people here so far and we're waiting on the n-double-a-cp to get here so we'll begin marching to the capital around
