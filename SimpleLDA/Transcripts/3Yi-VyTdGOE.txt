 hey there everyone day 31 the beginning of week seven of this vlog as we continue to wrestle with what it means to be the church as our temple space is temporarily unavailable to us what does it mean to be God's people gathered around the table gathered around his promises in our own homes and to be shaped into people who have both a character and the competencies of Jesus the identity and the ability to do the things that Jesus did I have a group of friends that I meet with on a regular basis who wrestle with these things and this identity piece is gonna play a big part in our conversation today about an Tribune's book during the dark we'll get to that in a second but for now we're looking once again at this idea of biblical hospitality if you're following along in the he reads truth or she reads truth reading series you may have noticed that we've skipped past day six to day eight one of the things I really like that those that organization does is to build in a grace day so if you miss your reading one day it's not like you have to drag yourself around with a lot of guilt saying oh I missed a day they build that in and then they also give you a day usually Sunday to memorize some scripture and I find that to be a helpful and healthy practice as well and so if you're with us on that if this is day eight we're talking about making room for widows and orphans once again a tricky thing to to figure out and if you're like me then the first place that your head goes when you think about making room for widows and orphans and and how we care for those who have lost somebody is what do I have to do for them or what about to give them out of my resources because that's how best I'm going to take care of them and I think that can be a daunting task that can make me feel like I'm inadequate for doing what God has called me to do to care for those around me but then again this idea of making room for people who have lost others how do I make room not just in my heart but also in my time in my own physical space if that's possible we can't really do that right now but what does it mean to grieve along with someone and I think that gets very close to the heart of what it means to make room for widows and orphans I really like the the the devotion that came with this series today and talking about how we can never fully understand what someone is going through back when Leanne was doing her DCE training and I had yet to kind of delve into the heart of training to be a pastor at the seminary I remember she reminded me from her own studies for her youth ministry decree that you should never tell someone I know exactly how you feel and I've always held that and abided by that as best I can because I can never really understand exactly how someone feels and the devotion did a good job of kind of reinforcing that it says full understanding is not the goal compassion for a brokenness you may never know is the goal so instead of thinking out to do something for this person one of the most important things I can do is to be compassionate to create some space where we can do some corporate grieving and I like how this really kind of brings it all together this is where I'm going to drive it to the scripture passage John 14 is what we're going to be looking at the devotion says and this is written by an author who is a widower so he can speak from personal experience he says the fear of the widow or the orphan of anyone grieving a great loss is that they will only be known as people who have been left and abandoned and such a profound thought that too for a person to feel like they're oh they'll only be known as the wounded person or the person who is lost or the person who has been abandoned that's a really powerful thing and it doesn't have to define us because first and foremost you've heard me say this many times before probably you are very much loved child of God that's your identity that's the thing you hold to and so how do we call a person back to that identity and treat one another as people who are broken by sin living in a broken world trying to figure that out and each bearing our own sign of that brokenness and this is where I think the words of Jesus that we heard in our reading today is just just beautiful I'm John 14 verse 18 Jesus says to his disciples I will not leave you as orphans I am coming to you this is Jesus sitting around the table with his disciples at the Last Supper I will not leave you as orphans I'm not going to abandon you I will come for you and so as we live in a broken world that is does a pretty good job of breaking us how do we make space to do some of that corporate grieving that that hard but compassionate work of saying I'm with you I know this is hard you're gonna get through this I'm gonna walk with you and on the other side of this you have a promise from Jesus that you all will not be abandoned by him even though you may feel abandoned or lost or the weight of that that hole in your heart where a person used to be we have a savior who is unwilling to let that stand for all time so what we bear that now I'm with you and I want to be a picture of the kingdom and Jesus to you in this moment making that space for the corporate grieving I think is one of the most healthy things we can do and it's something that we're all called to not just me as a pastor but all of us to sit with those who have lost and know that we've lost things too and that there's gonna be a restoration coming so I hope that gives you some some encouragement as far as enduring in the dark goes again this idea of identity it's a strong theme for me today like I said the friends that I I meet with on a regular basis have talked a lot about identity and how rest connects that that's what our conversation was about today and so when Peterson kind of brings that up in this chapter about scared and sacred it it really resonated with me he kind of talks about how we can be scared of not having some sort of meaning attached to our lives that everything we do is meaningless and this digs pretty deep at the idea of identity that my identity is found in what I do and what I produced in his case and how artistic he is and I resonate with that as well as a creative and as a creator so to speak of of content and writing sermons and having conversations with people you want to be able to give people something even this vlog has been an exercise in creativity but what does it mean to kind of hang your head on that effort every day and say well maybe today I made the crate maybe I didn't maybe some of you are thinking that right now but what does it mean to not found our identity in our work but in who God calls us to be and that there is there are sacred things all around us and when we know our identity is secure then it's it's not that we have to create the sacred we just have to see how God is making all things new and point those things out to people around us I think on page 18 of adorning the dark Peterson just does a fantastic job of this so here's what it says the Christians calling in part is to proclaim God's Dominion in every corner of the world in every corner of our hearts - it isn't that we're fighting a battle in which we must win ground from the forces of evil the ground is already one Satan is just an outlaw I love that that way of putting us eight it's just an outlaw and we have the pleasure of declaring God's kingdom with love service and peace in our homes and communities when you pray dedicates your home your yard your bone room you injured and dishwasher and bicycle and garden to the king as surely as you dedicate your heart to him dedicate your front porch and I think if we're looking for a connection to the whole joining Jesus idea there's a big part of that that that fits dedicate not just your heart but your front porch not just the inner recesses of your heart where you know who you are or you're supposed to but the places where people gather and again I kind of round this off with one more little passage on the next page which just really hit me right where I am as far as identity conversations at the end of the last chapter he asked this question who do I think I am anyway which is a really the important way for those of us who want to leave meaning in our wake to say who am i anyway to be speaking up to be speaking into the darkness to be putting something out there and not knowing what God's gonna do with it and doubting myself here's what he says who do I think I am anyway we need not look anywhere but to the eyes of our Savior for our true identity and identity which is profoundly complex unfathomable deep as the sea and yet can be boiled down to one little word beloved that's it and that's why it's so silly and perilous to use your gifting to clothe yourself with meaning those clothes will never quite fit well my friends that's where my head and heart space has been today I hope that's encouraging and provokes an healthy growth in conversation that's all I got for you for today so for the time being stay connected to God's Word be well look out for those around you your neighbors and those that God has placed in your life and I will see you tomorrow God's peace Tia pastor out
