        hey guys so enjoying some coconut water coffee after my walk and swim I'm feeling good but I think I need to get out of the Sun for a little bit so I'm gonna have this hopefully the caffeine combo platter with the electrolytes will help me a little bit but I am loving the blue monkey ah coconut water in the blue glass it's so good you guys would totally love it so you should definitely try and then I use that cool brew cold brew concentrate it's super good so I'm just drinking some of this 2030 I'm gonna make some lunch soon and then I'm gonna do a workout at some point I don't know what I want to do I'll probably do Melissa wood that sounds good today so I think I'm gonna do that at some point but I want to just like read my book a little bit I'm reading it out of your head by Jenny Allen I told you guys about that but if you have any book racks you guys should like let me know because I'm just flying through books this warranty and I have read a lot and it's really been like a great habit to like just kind of that I want to instill in my day-to-day life I feel like I want to like talk to you guys more about healthy habits like that I've kind of learned from this quarantine that I want to like bring it into my life more if that makes sense so I'll totally me feel like to that in this video but one of them is definitely reading another one is going on walks in the morning on and like making that part of my morning routine another one is the wim HOF method breathing okay if you guys haven't tried that you actually need to it's insane I don't even know if I've talked about it yet but wim HOF was all the SUNY confidential podcast and he is a breathwork guy and he is an app called wim HOF method you can literally just look up when HOF wim speech space HOF s on the App Store and it's seriously so good guys it's like bizarre because you like fully breathe in and then fully breathe out it's like fully and letting go and then you do that a bunch for like 30 breaths and then you hold your breath for as long as you can and I usually just do one or two rounds of it and that's enough it makes me feel like a new person but I'm obsessed with it alex is coming home so I'm going to read and make some match with a long easy exhale out the mouth let everything go  hey guys so I just showered host Melissa what health yes oh my oh you're good you've been staying here that was bleak but I just showered how you got some Sun today okay um but I just shower post Melissa what health and honestly I don't know before I did Melissa what I was just feeling so anxious and for me and I'm all about listening to your body but for me when I'm feeling anxiety it's really imperative and really helpful for me to just let go of my body so whether that be going on a walk doing um are really like low-key in yoga class with like just like intense or not that's just like super calm stretching like whatever that may be um but I just love doing Melissa because she her workouts are like a slow burn so it's nothing too intense it's all I can do like a Sarah stay sweaty shredder or something but it's nothing too intense and also her voice is just so calming and so now I feel so soothed and just home and it's for 48 and honestly we're probably gonna start making dinner soon just because like why not on but I don't know I yeah I I was I was just feeling really anxious before and like I don't know I go through such weird faces with like everything that's going on and sometimes I'll be totally fine with it and just like enjoying like the like the chill life for lack of everything but other times I just like start to get really anxious and I realized that I just can't think about it too much because if I start to like really think into it then I just start worrying about my family and start worrying about like just everything honestly and I think this time has also been weird because like it gives us the opportunity with which it is an opportunity because I think it's a huge opportunity for growth but the opportunity to be alone with our thoughts without much distraction and I think for me that has provided grounds for self-reflection but it's also been a little bit scary of course like as you would think it is but I don't know I'm just reading my book and in it Jenny Allen get out of your head that's a book on but she was talking about loneliness and just how we're never truly alone because like we're always with God or whatever you want to call the universe or whatever you want to call it um and that just like really hit with me because I think recently I've just been feeling super lonely and I don't know like to be completely straightforward with you guys like sometimes I just I I feel like because I am kind of just like a I don't want to say a lone wolf but I just kind of do my own thing I don't really like to go out I just like I don't mind being alone but sometimes I feel like I miss out on like so much of like the college experience and I miss out on just like things that would have been so much fun that I like was never a part of I don't know if that makes sense but I don't know I think it's because I've been in Florida I was like and his brother like loved hanging out with the boys and stuff but I just like I don't know I miss friends and like I missed that social interaction and I don't know sometimes I feel like I missed out on the majority of like college because I I don't know but then I like think about it and I'm like but I don't like I don't like partying I don't like that stuff anyways but I don't know guys I'm just thinking and hydrating making and hydrating but yeah I just kind of want to share where my thoughts were with you guys cuz there's still weird and I'm also really burnt and my mom is gonna if she's watching this she's gonna like freak out she hates when I get too much Sun so this is a chance I remember about now like I'm not even lying I'm kind of impressed like this ring if I move it I have a tan line from it and that's like actually so exciting for me like look oh my god you can see it hilarious I love it um but I think I'm gonna maybe watch some YouTube read a little bit and then we'll get Dinner started I have leftover tuna not even leftover I have more tuna to cook um I got fresh tuna at that fish market um and they're like ketchup every day and it's so good I've been eating fish hair just because I didn't get told you guys it's like I like to eat like if there's wild-caught fresh fish fish like I'll eat it and stuff like that um I'm just more about like quality stuff I don't want like I don't know I wanted it like have it it's sustainably and ethically as possible in life yeah so yeah I'm gonna go for a little bit but I love you guys I'm really grateful for you guys and I'm really grateful for in this channel having a little sparkling water with lime action yeah I made a little snack plate just cuz I'm hungry but we're not gonna dinner yet so this is what I made this is what I'll have I have some sort of snack usually just veggies with hummus I'm not a huge scene actor but I'm hungry right now so I have some snap peas that I soaked in water and sulfur if you do so they're kinda like cooked ish it works it's really good if you do cold water and salt with um oh I guess this is green beans and then celery a little bit cabbage cucumber and some carrot if you've ever been a tree food kitchen this reminds me of their veggie platter and then I'm washing his girl on YouTube I've been really into her name's Katie Musser she's really cool so I like her yeah so I'm just gonna do this we are cooking and listening to Sabrina Colicchio could do but get yourself a boy who cooks and cleans seriously
