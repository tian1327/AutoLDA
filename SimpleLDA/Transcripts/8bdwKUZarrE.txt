Miyagi and the suicide doors barber khari look at me now yeah look at me down uh-oh get your paint Birds would get me there yeah this is it I could I could think of the title of the song at the ROI through yo a bunch of rice killed his birthright so I didn't write to Busta Rhymes I was not about to rap that fast I wrote it to that beat to match Chris style you know I just I just say all that to say that I wrote this verse about phineas and ferb because it's my favorite cartoon I actually wrote a jingle to that song as well and I wanted to send it in so bad and that was probably around 2014 about 2014 2015 when I wrote that jingle and I just never sent it in I just never knew how and not regret not trying much harder to sin in that jingle because it was just so cool but snapbacks what's the thing right when that came out sup sotas gonna do a snippet right cuz some time I do this whole thing cuz this is still a genius and I'll need nobody tryin to copyright my stuff and steal my stuff you know I'm saying that backs in new shoes snapbacks in new shoes where's Perry green and orange black toes in satsang snapbacks in new shoes and I snapped back sent a to sneezes made me nauseous been like that since grade school like yeah listen listen my ping game was on point oh my god I gotta reach out to the creators being in the first either comeback bit cartoon man but yeah just going through a lot of this old stuff man look I found my college ID hey oh my goodness and that is all faded I need to really throw it away but the only reason I haven't because it saved me quite a few times as far as picture identification when I need it to show a secondary one but yeah mine was about at the end guys of sorting it out and then I'm just gonna put it up where everything goes just like to you guys another of that now like this is a Ticketmaster receipt order when I went to Joe's concert like the singer Joe I wanna know what's wrong the date on this receipt is August 7th 2015 and you better know BB Kings was opened and now BB King's is closed but nostalgia purposes I really want to keep this but for space purposes I need to throw this away but I'm gonna keep it for now and then when it comes to town and I couldn't let it go let it go that's my problem on a few things here I found older pictures so this is a picture with my mom when she was getting married to my dad my mother right there in a dish dinner and I want to say that this is Mama and Papa turns who used to take care of my mom which is here this is my IT Bonita I don't really know who these other people are I know there are a couple of other relatives in that picture of course like I said I found other lyrics poems when I was modeling I found a modeling bagless how about I found a list of things that I was travelling back to New York from Alabama on the bus and when we came to a stop it was like a stop dead I don't know some I feel like it was a random stop but it was a stop that we made the bus driver put off the bags was getting off at this stop he ended up putting off my bag and I wasn't getting off on that stop and there was a point where I got to I was trying to sue and put him in court for it I went through with it and I warned the case but they countered the case somehow I don't know and they also had a sign up in their establishment saying they weren't responsible for lost items and that was the way that they argue that we haven't notified on here before you even buy a ticket I don't know is just something like that but these are sorta atoms that I lost I don't remember what year this was but I had a laptop in there with the case Burberry shades which I love so much Bogg shades I had my converse sneakers I had a whole cream soup from sure Ruth I had these dopes like 90s retro flip shades I had a ring in there some you know surgery I had purses in there and I have multiple heels in there so just looking at this list this is something that I just need to let go there's quite a few receipts that I have in here okay this is from 2014 this is when I bought my first bluetooth PA portable system and I started singing in the subway and I was making more money in the subway than what I was doing working at this dark spot that I ended up quitting because me and the owner just kept clashing and I was making $7.25 an hour or something like that and when I got on the subway I was just like yeah I'm out oh man Times is really in this bag how about you guys so I have sifted through the pile this is trash thank god this I already know I wear it where it's gonna go and transfer things rewrite things and put away this already know I can put this away like this is gonna go in my drawer these are gonna go on my refrigerator this is ongoing another drawer and it's gonna go in a suitcase this is business card stack and this is what's left over to see what I'm going to do with it and I already know what I'm gonna do with it now after I get done with this hmm I need to take care of this pile all right guys it's just one get out here walk and talk with you guys for a minute also take a break from those papers so this morning when I woke up I received a phone call from my mom my auntie auntie Ginny who was married to my uncle chuck my Uncle Chuck is really my uncle but I just called her Auntie Ginny because she's married to my uncle you know what I mean so but my uncle's wife my mom called and told me that she passed at 11 p.m. last night and if you guys have been on my channel you have seen her I want to say you was uh it was a Thanksgiving and there was another time I went over there to visit you not seeing her a few times on my channel and it's just very unfortunate she was dealing with stomach cancer and she was in stage four when they found out when she got diagnosed with it so you know my prayers definitely go out to my uncle and her kids through this whole thing seem like she got everything you order before you know she started going through the worst of it the crazy part is it looks like she was getting better at one point and this thing you know she went back into the hospital because she was feeling pains and she ended up she couldn't walk she couldn't talk and it was heartfelt I'll gonna take care of her but of course like he loved her and he really tried his best and like I said just something you know really unfortunate I don't know when the funeral is I don't even know how they're gonna do the funeral it's in Alabama so of course it's not overcrowded like it is here in New York so what they'll probably do is like some of the funeral homes that are doing here whenever they have funerals that only let about two or three people in at a time to pay their respects so yeah it's just one let you guys know that that was the news I received this morning when I woke up well yeah you know just in the midst of this whole crisis you definitely still have people who passed away from other things besides coronavirus and who the Sun just went behind a cloud I know y'all just saw that change you know lighting well yeah my prayers you know my heart goes out to all the families who are losing people during this time and losing people to the coronavirus and just going through a whole devastation so like I said just one the walkins talking to you guys for a second for this reason I'm actually gonna get ready to work out pretty soon it's a really nice day I may just go ahead and get out and run I wanna end up the ship went into the hospital after a while there are times when the doctors and nurses they can't do anything else for you and so they see you to the house to pass away so in that case that we are pretty much strongly thinking what it was because we just couldn't do anything else flora and so you know 11:00 p.m. last night that happy but she actually lived a little longer than what they gave her I think she's this about going on a month longer there's no man you never know the time you know another day you never know the place that you want to pass away don't like the doctors will be your last word because the last man belongs to the man up there let's go they can give you an expiration date all day but the last desperation date that counts you know what I mean but I'm gonna go ahead and end this blog here I love you guys in George's loft but it was pretty much gonna spend the rest of the day getting my room together cleaning things organizing things working out and you know just think a little bit about my auntie and you know cuz she was very sweet she was sweet to my mom yeah that's pretty much it and I just see where the rest of the day takes me from here oh yeah man you know it's just she was really cool you know she gave you gifts and stuff you know for holidays and she was just she was a sweet person she was the guys remember to like comment below and subscribe to this channel to become the family I love you guys so much thank you guys for showing your love and
