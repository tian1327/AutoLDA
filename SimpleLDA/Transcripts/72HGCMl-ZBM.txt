 who decides to move during the pandemic I don't know crazy people hey guys welcome back to my channel teacher ish I'm Kia I'm a first-year kindergarten teacher and today's video is going to be like a mini apartment tour / what it's like to be a teacher and Illinois and what's the pay like and all of those good things so I had every intention of logging us moving into our new apartment but it was so hectic and it was so crazy and I picked up the camera for like maybe a minute and then things just got here and uhm who decides to move during the pandemic I don't know crazy people so anyway it was very difficult to moving truck we had some little glasses we live on the third floor so there was like three flights of stairs it was just a mess it was a mess it was hard finally you've got everything moved in we're here we here I'm so happy on my girlfriend and I have been together for three years and I have been nagging her sudden move out and move in with me and I'm leaving so we're finally in our own place and I'm just so excited about that so yeah I had every intention of logging the move process but was just so crazy that I'm sorry I was laying to do that so I decided to do like a mini apartment where I um disclaimer do not and I repeat do not come for me do not come for me about this apartment y'all because um moving during a pandemic is hard especially when you're trying to buy furniture all the furniture stores are closed it's hard to buy things online because it's forever to ship so we have every intention of having our apartment fully funded furnished by the time we moved in but girl these places are playing with us so like our bed set like all the furniture for the living room furniture for the dining room was supposed to come in but it's taking weeks for it to get here so we are struggle busting right now like seriously struggle button so do not come for me about anything that you see the struggle bus because it's coming guys it's coming it's just don't take a while because of the pandan making because of everything so it's a little disappointing but whatever I just had to do with mini apartment tour anyways but don't come for me    entryway when you come in you see these our living room our living room is my favorite in the house because it has these big little beautiful light right now we put the cat tower here but that cat tower is not gonna stay there we're gonna put some benches here and do like a cute little reading nook unless you come this way and this is Q's office I don't want to go in there cuz it's just boxes like I said y'all do not come for me because have you ever tried to move during a pandemic it's hard so here's our bedroom like I said do not come for me where those pullout thingies are we're gonna put our dresser we ordered the dresser but it's not gonna get here for another week or two we got a new mattress one of those to lucid dream mattress it's like a mattress in a box it's very comfortable yes we're sleeping on the floor do not come for me do not comfort me okay guys but anyways they've got pretty windows eventually we're gonna get some curtains to put up you know privacy then you come down this hall this is the bathroom but keep taking a showers but here's my kitchen our kitchen is also one of my favorite places in the house because it's so big and it's bright and yeah and then we have like this dining area but as you can see it's kind of just like storage and cat because of the kitties so we're just using it for storage right now until we get like a dining room set our back door there's like so there's a porch but we have to take the garbage downstairs it's not thank you so you know this is the kitchen it's so spacious and big I'm so happy about the kitchen because our kitchen and my little apartment was so freakin tiny it was so small so yeah it's very cute and then over here we have my office there's like boxes and if you guys have enogh a fun fact about me I collect katanas or people call them samurai swords so that's a random fact about me and then this is my office I still have a lot to unpack and put away I brought this desk in my vanity with me from my old apartment and then we have this random one and a half bath Julia it's cute yeah that's pretty much it oh this is also my storage I put all my school stuff but it's a mess okay so I'm actually really in love with this bathroom we're all English shower curtains to calm them so I'll put a shower curtain up there but this side bathroom and then there's trunk we're getting it like us the words thing to go right here but yeah the bad thing was one of my favorite things about this apartment like I said this has been like a long time in the movie and it's just really exciting to have her own place like you pay for it you did everything for it you picked it out all that good stuff so yeah it's a really exciting time your teacher you're broke you just got out of school you don't have any money how I don't have anything so college so I wanted to do a video on how it is to be a teacher in Illinois financially I just want to be transparent and answer some questions and I always get about how much teachers make and do you pay during the summers and is it are you able to live comfortably on a teacher's salary so the first question is how much do you make so as a teacher in Illinois how much you make really depends on the district Illinois is one of those states that it's very don't find it like the districts are very divided between the disparity between like wealthy and low socioeconomic status it's a big range so I know somewhere teachers who are making thirty five thirty seven thousand I know some first-year teachers who are making forty eight forty nine almost fifty thousand dollars on our first year so it really just depends on the district in the area that you teach it if you work for CPS you're gonna make more but you're probably gonna get less resources like provided for you if you work in the suburbs you're probably gonna make a little bit less but the school provides more for you in terms of teacher resources and things like that so we really just depends on where you want to live in Illinois if you live closer to the city the teacher salary goes up a little bit more if you work for CPS the teacher salary starting point it's a little bit higher it's probably way higher than the London suburbs but there's so many factors into determining a salary and it's the difference it's a good fit for you so it really just depends on how much you want to make and where you want to live and all the sudden things that one should care about if you care about making my money and you care about the school providing for you more so really just depends in Illinois I work on this in the south suburbs of Chicago I do not work for CBS but I work in addition from South Laberge and I started at 42,000 and there's 2,000 of it went to like retirement I really started with 40,000 so my channel read for my first TV was $40,000 now you can like if you're curious about how much you're going to make as a first year teacher every single district in Illinois and I think in the United States every single district has to provide their union contract online for the community and the teachers to see so what I did was I looked up you can always look up the salary in your district he'll tell you and most of it it's on a step scale so you start as a first year teacher you might start with oh sorry this salary and then each year it'll probably go up by I say tomayto money so that's how I found out how much I was gonna make before I got hired and before I apply to those districts and I was interested in working in so this is not something that's like I'm telling you all secrets of the waiver you can really don't look this stuff up any school that you want to work at you can go look up the salary okay so the second question about being a teacher and the cost of living the cost of living in Illinois is ridiculous it's pretty it's pretty high it's not as bad as like New York or California but it's pretty steep like a two-bedroom apartment in Chicago it's probably gonna cost you about especially depending on where you live where you want to live if you want to live up north they would look for the sound but overall Illinois does have a very high cost of living so maybe that's something you want some factoring when you're looking for a job do you want to have a higher salary but then you have a higher cost of living when you wanna have a lower salary in the suburbs at even higher cost of living as well I know this for renting for buying a house it also depends on where you live in Illinois a little boy is very segregated it's a very like I don't know I just it really just depends on the area like some places are really high in more unit so it's very low some places behind rent places are medium for the most part but the cost of living living in Illinois is pretty high and comfortably on the teacher's salary in Illinois short answer yes but it depends on what you think comfortably is you can live comfortably if you budget your money and you save and use your money-wise um I can say that on my salary I can live comfortably I could pay my rent and pay my car note a pretty comfortably um I can take care of bills and I can also save and splurge a little bit but for the most part it's really about budgeting how you budget your money and this is something that I'm still working on luckily got my partner it's very good at budgeting and saving and all that stuff and something for her but yeah but I want to get better at can you look comfortably on a seat your salary yes but it depends on what you think is comfortable and if you are good at budgeting your money do I spin on school supplies for my classroom I'm a first year teacher so I probably spend way more than I should be on materials and things like that one because I started off with nothing being a first year teacher so yeah I didn't really have a big library or a big teacher resources so I probably sent away more than I shouldn't my classroom but I'm here Kannagi also my school this is another thing that you can do for your district does your district provide you guys with a stipend or resources for your classroom every year now my district does is we put in a requisition order at the end of the year and we get whatever supplies you order at the fall but B just because we order something does not mean awareness so we always going to get what we ordered sometimes the district thinks if it's too expensive or whatever they'll just say we can't afford this right now but for the most part um school supplies pencils crayons highlighters markers paper all the necessary things for the kids they supply that and then our teacher resources we get all of the curriculum problems with books laptops for the kids and we give a teacher laptop and all those things so I my school does actually a pretty good job of providing those things but we don't always get necessarily everything so sometimes I do have to come out of my pocket and also for those specific things that I want specifically for my class into my pocket for like flexible seating or like you see little decorations for my classroom for my pocket for that which brings me to a point I am so sad that all those there stores are closed I'm so sad because I was really about to be at my birthday bag and I was gonna get some little pillows and rugs with cute little characters for my classroom from the der storm that's probably not gonna happen in are probably gonna have to pay out of pocket for new stuff which I'm so sad let's take a side oh the fighter jet there's fighter jets well that's crazy I'm a good fighter jets he knows like who jet planes there's jet plane like three of them and like in a row like a bird like a bird be those three of them in a row just they're like oh how do i budget okay I don't that's what we do with it so before me my girlfriend moved in we had to sit down and basically create a budget for how much we wanted to spin them up for our apartment how much you want it to sit on food gas electricity all that stuff so we really planned it out before we moved out so basically just budget monthly we set aside our money for rent and all those other things some tips that some tips that I have for budgeting would be to little cash envelopes so you don't have to go buy a bunch of but you couldn't you want to or you can make number lips but get the cash envelopes and set aside cash cash cash cash cash set aside cash for everything is you in a buy so you could have - of look for food a caption but for going out a cache of little poor brain on us of indeed be up your money into those envelopes and so when you're going out take the going out and below and go out and once you run out of money that's it right I feel like when you have a debit card you can just like that's like and you just forget about it like you're not thinking when you have cash like once at cash is a lot like that's it so I recommend the cash envelopes it's something that I'm gonna start doing and I maybe only taught me there's this an Instagram that I follow her name is an order name is but her Instagram handle does make real sense and she she put on her page the cash envelopes and I thought it was a really good idea and she's also a budget wizard so I recommend checking her out all the courage and down below guys I hope you like this video if you have any
