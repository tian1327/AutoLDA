 week two of the quarantine       hello guys I know the lighting is really weird right now there's like no sunlight outside so we're working with what we have but it's about 10 o'clock in the morning I'm in myself wake up at 9:15 today so I could like get an early start to my day because this week is the official first week of online classes so I need to get prepared I need to do a bunch of work and I just need to be productive and kind of get a routine going for the rest of this whole situation so far like I just like got ready for the day I've only cute shirts make my field myself feel good I mean my bad and now I'm about to go ahead and make a checklist of everything that I want to get done today I do daily to do this so I can just check everything off but I get done for the day so I can feel like accomplished even if it's not like a big productive day if I'm just writing like a couple tasks that I want to get done throughout the day like I'll feel better but myself and I'll be able to keep track of the days so that's very important I feel really happy that like I just like did a super quick like natural face today just it just makes me feel like I'm going somewhere which helps I'm leaving my glasses on because I have to do a lot of school work and I have to edit my blog so I'm just gonna be staring at a computer screen the entire day and I have like blue light glasses so these are gonna help to not make me go crazy amount give me a crazy headache    okay so we finished eating breakfast so Ricky's gonna go back and do some work in the living room I'm gonna go ahead and get my English homework out of the way and done that'll probably take me like an hour and totals do all the things I have to do for that and then I think after that I'll probably work on editing my blog and just go see how things go it's only 1216 right now I'm just so happy because I'm so much more productive than I've been the entire week usually I'll be waking up around like 11:00 11:30 and I'm like I didn't just not like actually getting out of bed to make food so this is good guys I've already gotten my midterm done I've written down my will to do this I'm gonna - homework I'm on a good track I'm feeling happy feeling very positive about today so so what the blog is finally uploading I had to like go through and watch it to make sure like it there was no mistakes in there and everything like that but now I'm just gonna go ahead and work on some Spanish homework probably while this is uploading yeah that's gonna take two and a half hours cuz my Wi-Fi is literally trash we are the epitome of health it's an apocalypse though so it's okay I'm about to do the ordinary aging BJP in solution I talked about this in my last vlog and then I also just made like an apple cider vinegar and like hot water mix because I feel a little bloated it's probably that frozen pizza that did me over but I just feel like a balloon so I'm gonna drink that I'm gonna leave this mask on for about seven minutes okay guys so I put on my night time it's gonna care I'm gonna let that soak in for like probably like 20 minutes before I go to sleep and just work on some Spanish in the meantime I got mostly everything done that I wanted to do today except for wash my makeup brushes I did not do that but we'll do that tomorrow it's fine I'm going to drink the rest of this apple cider vinegar and hot water make sure that tastes terrible  hello guys so I finished up my online lecture like an hour ago I've really just been watching Tech Talks I just made the bed so I'm gonna go ahead and don't make breakfast then I want to make avocado toast because that sounds really good and we have an avocado we have to use  okay so my plan for today is I really want to make a bunch of tik-tok so it's like a bunch of ideas I have I'm probably gonna try to make at least two so I'm gonna go ahead and straight my hair and then after that I'm gonna start doing my makeup and everything hello guys as you can see I totally it snapped on this look I'm getting in she go vibes I'm Kim Possible i I didn't mm-hmm I did it so we are going to make buffalo chicken quesadillas I'm very excited are you

sauce and then we have some cheese and the fridge that we're gonna add to it and then we're gonna make we got some Windex oh yeah as a side and then we're also gonna put spinach and onion  so I did like a little bit of like a booty workout not much like my phantoms I just did like a couple exercises with my resistance band and then did like a throughout workouts again nothing intense because I'm just not feeling like motivated to do any where counts right now I don't know why I just could not work out in my home it's just not happening for me I just really wish I go to the gym because that's where I really like get into it and go full force and get the workout done and over with the probability of me coming out of this quarantine slightly more fluffy it's gonna happen give them your girl is my feelings whole exercise thing guys I just got the most amazing news that I'm so excited about my packaging class okay so when my packaging class started I was really excited about it but then we had this whole thing with our teacher where she just like wasn't showing up for like multiple weeks in a row and like was canceling class and so we had literally had two classes and then we had like one class with the new professor that we have and then we got shut down so my new professor just emailed us that she was gonna change like what we were doing for a final project and everything we have to design like packaging for skincare brand for Halsey like we literally have to like envision it as like Holly's brand of skincare I was made to do this I am literally so hype so in celebration of my project being assigned and my packaging for us being at 3 o'clock today I'm wearing my halls that you come inside sure because literally like I cannot tell you guys how excited I am for this project some Spanish work right now but I'm so like insecure because we have to do like a voicethread and like respond and I'm so insecure about how my Spanish sounds because I want to sound right because like the Mexican enemy is just like come on girl you got this but then the white girl in me is also like you sound stupid and I just don't know I just hate being Hispanic not being able to see Spanish and whitewashed and taking Spanish because I'm like I should be able to do this like I'm at I made a mood board for my project I'm gonna follow like the theme of Clementine and I have a lot of ideas for the skincare line so I'm very excited you guys I have so many ideas for this project oh my god I thought up another idea for the line that would be good and now I don't know what one to do because they both look good well my head literally hurts from staring at the computer screen for so long but like I'm so into this project it's honestly like it's making me so happy with this project and it's just the beginning and I didn't a lot more than I was supposed to do for the research portion I did like pretty much my holes so I get that I want to do for both of my ideas I'm just so excited Roy is too like all come together okay so Ricky made dinner this looks delicious we're having some chicken wings it has brown sugar paprika vinegar yeah and now a hot sauce and then some queer rice I'm super tired oh and garlic powder I'm gonna rake it up I'm super excited to eat this hello everyone is Thursday morning the 26 um I just got some cereal to eat for breakfast yeah my coffee thanks to the key you need my coffee and oh he's just playing video games Oh an hour amazing laundry pile you can see back there it needs to be a productive day like I literally have no choice let's make it a productive day I have to get on some math assignment so it's about the quizzes and then I need to work on a group project with my group I think we're gonna call each other around 2 or 3 to work on it I need to film a video not like a tutorial for my Instagram maybe some tech talks I don't know you have you to work on Spanish I have a lot of stuff to actually do right now I'm just watch me Molly Bailey if you guys watch her let me know I would really love her she's like one of my favorite youtubers I am this is my morning basically  and he's gonna shut it up as always hence shrimp and shrimp I mean I have really blogged much today but we just got back from the store we went to the grocery store because it's ready for a tomorrow so we need to get some stuff to make it a special dinner we wanted to go out but obviously that's I'm probably not gonna vlog a lot tomorrow like I think I'm just gonna try to vlog like a little bit when I wake up and then obviously I'll show you guys like the dinner and everything but besides that I really want us to just like spend time together oh so you like what I'm eating and doing but basically I won't be doing anything but eating and doing homework or this whole weekend most likely so I are already started eating this but this is the delicious dinner that Ricky made uh what's the name of it I don't know what the name of it is but it's got spinach mushrooms tomatoes chicken garlic and like a like a pink Parmesan sauce and it's hey guys so it is the next morning I didn't really blog that much yesterday I just wanted to show you really quickly he just went to the supermarket to just get a couple more things that we needed for the recipe tonight because the supermarket we went to yesterday didn't have everything we needed so he has to go to a different one in the meantime I wanted to show you guys like what I got him and like the card that I got him cuz it's so cute oh I mean as you've seen from my vlogs we always watched the office whenever we're eating like breakfast or whatever um it's just like one of our favorite shows to wash together I'm just gonna like scratch it out and then say that you're the gym to my Pam because it makes more sense um so for one of his gifts I got him the Sephora favorites sampler I always get him his product Cologne which is running out he usually uses like this Prada one but it's like a different one that's like the sport or whatever I forgot what it is I figured I could get him a sampler and then he could try out a bunch of different fragrances see which one he likes the best and then he can redeem it there's a certificate in here to redeem it for a full-size so I think these are great gifts if you like want to get someone a fragrance but you're not sure if you want to get them the same one that they always get or if you just don't know which one they would like I got here this black chain necklace okay he just has been really wanting like a nice chain for the longest time and he had just gotten a chain for his brother and he was like oh man I kinda want one too so I went ahead and got him this one so I did a look for Instagram and I made a tick-tock I'm exhausted it don't be so long to do because I had to cut up these lashes and that took a while and then I did this like glitter tear which it looks really cute I am now I don't know what to do because I'm bored so I just got out of the shower I need to wash my hair real bad so I'm happy I did that Ricky is making a dinner right now we're having ramen but he makes it like really good so it's like maestro I'm excited because he adds like a bunch of different things to it to make it special I'm gonna try to go ahead and plan out like my week and make myself schedule because although I was like more productive this week I still was not like the full production level that I would like to be in terms of like making content and keeping up with my schoolwork but I want to keep it realistic because and if I don't then like there will be no point making a schedule you guys look at this ramen I told you he makes it like a fancy ramen that you would get at a restaurant I am so hype wow it's not that hard any of you at home could do it you just take a regular instant ramen packet boil an egg cooking chicken season it up mushrooms whatever you want I made my whole schedule for the week my whole schedule is going to be very jam-packed for the week if I stick to it which they'll also stick to it because I need to be productive I think that's pretty much it for this vlog for this week it's Sunday night it's how I'm about to go to sleep yeah so I will start blogging tomorrow again sure to follow me on my Instagram both my personal and my beauty depending on if you wanted to see
